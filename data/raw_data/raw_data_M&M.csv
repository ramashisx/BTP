Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

We change our FY24/FY25 core EPS estimates by 5%/0%/-0.7% to factor in higher SUV volumes, largely in-line margin performance and marginal decrease in ASP. M&M’s 2QFY24 revenue came below our and consensus estimate likely led by lower-than-expected ASPs in the Automotive segment. EBITDA margin at 12.6% came below our estimate of 12.9%, and was largley in-line with consensus. Management noted that FES margins had one-time impact from bunched-up launch costs and operating de-leverage. Suppply issues have larely normalised and MM is on track to reach 49k units SUV capacity for FY24 (at 42k at present). MM’s SUV orderbook remains robust helped by good demand for its products, despite ramp-up in production. We believe M&M should benefit from (1) growing customer preference for SUV, (2) ramp-up in production to fulfill strong demand and order book, (3) market share gains in the tractor industry from new segments, and (4) rampup in EV portfolio starting 2025.



Outlook

Also, benign RM, operating leverage and end of volume of introductory priced model will benefit margins (we buil-in ~150bps expansion over FY23-26E). Retain ‘BUY’ with TP of Rs 1,740 (Rs. 1,775 earlier) valuing at 18x on Sep-25E core EPS and Rs 326 for subsidiaries.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M’s 2QFY24 operating performance was lower as EBITDA came in at INR30.7b (vs est. INR32b). Adjusted PAT surpassed expectations at INR34.5b (vs est. INR28b), primarily driven by better-than-expected other income, attributable to higher dividends. We believe 2HFY24 will be a relatively better period vis-à-vis 1H, led by growth in tractor volumes and execution of SUV orders.

Outlook

We raised our FY24E/FY25E EPS by 5%/2% to account for higher ‘other income’ and lower tax despite a cut in EBITDA. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR1,775 (based on Dec’25E SoTP).

Rajneesh Bansal (in his late 40s), the founder of a steel fabricating firm, wanted to switch from a midsize sedan to a large sports utility vehicle. After weighing his options, the Bhilai-based businessman went in for a seven-seater, feature-packed SUV even though the dealer said he would have to wait 40 weeks for the vehicle to be delivered.

Bansal said he stretched his budget beyond Rs 20 lakh and went for an automatic transmission premium SUV costing Rs 29 lakh. Equipped with an advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS), six airbags and other safety features, the vehicle’s road handling capabilities ensure that driving on any terrain is a breeze, according to Bansal.

“I have a family of five members which couldn’t be accommodated in the sedan I used to own earlier. So I needed a vehicle which had bigger space, higher ground clearance and was built by a homegrown brand. I would like to drive the car myself, so I finally picked an SUV that not only inspires confidence but also has a remarkable presence on the road,” Bansal told Moneycontrol.

Thanks to customers like Bansal, demand for SUVs has burgeoned over the past few years. After holding a 23.3 percent share of the passenger vehicle market in 2018, the SUV segment accounted for 48.7 percent of the 2.46 million units sold as of October-end. In October alone, 198,534 units were sold – over 50 percent of the total, according to industry officials.

Rugged appeal

Back-of-the-envelope calculations by the top five industry players predict that SUVs will account for almost 50 percent of 4.1 million-4.3 million passenger vehicles expected to be sold in 2023, which could take total SUV sales to about 2 million units. Last year, total passenger vehicle sales touched 3.43 million.

According to JATO Dynamics India, an automotive data intelligence company, the key drivers of India’s booming SUV market include changing consumer preferences, improved road conditions, more safety and comfort features, increased income levels, urbanisation, customisation options, rugged appeal, and competition among automakers.

“Customers in this market have diverse profiles, including families, young professionals, urban dwellers, outdoor enthusiasts, affluent buyers, and residents of suburban and rural areas,” noted Ravi Bhatia, MD of JATO Dynamics India.

Rapid growth

While carmakers have managed to cut down the prolonged waiting period for bestselling models – largely SUVs – caused by a shortage of semiconductors, most companies have not been able to increase production to match the current demand. As a result, utility vehicle bookings continue to skyrocket despite improved semiconductor supplies.

Mahindra & Mahindra, India’s largest utility vehicle maker, said recently there is sustained demand for its SUVs such as the XUV7OO, Scorpio-N, and Thar. A senior executive at the Mumbai-based automaker said that while monthly output is 39,000 units, average bookings are 51,000 units a month.

“The booking pipeline continues to be very strong as we have 286,000 units open bookings till November 1,” Rajesh Jejurikar, CEO of the auto and farm business at M&M, told reporters recently.

He said M&M had bookings for 10,000 XUV300 and XUV400 units, 70,000 XUV700 units, 76,000 Thar vehicles, 11,000 Bolero units, and 119,000 units of Scorpio (including Classic).

Market leader Maruti Suzuki India said its average SUV sales have increased to about 36,000 per month this year from 15,000 units per month in 2017-18. While the SUV segment has expanded 27 percent this year, for Maruti Suzuki, the growth was 172 percent.

The company currently has an orderbook for 226,000 passenger vehicles, of which 126,500 are utility vehicles. The order backlog includes 2,400 units of Jimny, 31,000 units of Brezza, 11,000 units of Fronz, 12,000 units of Grand Vitara and 70,000 units of Ertiga. The average waiting period of all the models is 2-3 months.

As Shashank Srivastava, senior executive officer, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki, put it, “The SUV segment has been growing rapidly over the last few years… It is expected that SUV sales will cross the 2 million mark (this year). This customer trend has resulted in many OEMs introducing multiple new products in this category.”

With a revamped line-up, Maruti Suzuki intends to corner 50 percent of the country's passenger car market.

“We have seen a huge transformation in this regard. From just one SUV in our portfolio and from being No. 5 in SUVs in Q1 last year, we now have a portfolio of four SUVs with a 23 percent share and are the No. 1 SUV maker in the auto industry during H1 of FY24. This is quite a dramatic change,” added Srivastava.

For Hyundai Motor India, SUVs accounted for 53.2 percent of sales last year. The South Korean carmaker claims its SUV portfolio received a “further boost” this year with the launch of micro-SUV Hyundai Exter, which has attracted almost 100,000 bookings till date. The company’s SUV share currently stands at 58.6 percent.

“The growth can be attributed to the higher demand of Hyundai SUVs like the Creta, Venue and the newly launched Exter. Creta has been the highest-selling model in the SUV portfolio with a contribution of 45.6 percent to Hyundai’s SUV sales,” said Tarun Garg, COO of Hyundai Motor India. “Hyundai’s biggest launch for the year – Exter – has received an overwhelming response… We believe we will end the year with around 60 percent contribution from SUVs.”

Tata Motors also has a wider SUV portfolio consisting of the recently launched Harrier, Safari, Nexon and the Punch. The Mumbai-based automaker claimed that SUVs contributed over 60 percent of its total sales and each one of them are among “top in their segments”.

“The current contribution of SUVs is over 60 percent and we expect the SUV share to further go up backed by the recent launches,” stated Vinay Pant, Head of Marketing, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Limited.

Honda Cars India Limited (HCIL) claimed its midsize SUV Elevate, which was launched in September, has got a good response.

“In the last two months, Elevate comprises of almost 50 percent of our domestic sales, backed by strong response to the model and overall robust demand for mid-size SUVs,” Kunal Behl, VP of marketing & sales at HCIL, said in an emailed response to queries sent by Moneycontrol.

The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations said SUVs are the flavour of not just one but multiple seasons. From 15-18 percent before the pandemic, SUV penetration in the passenger car segment is now close to 50 percent.

“If you look at the kind of bookings that dealers are getting right now, only premium SUVs are commanding a huge waiting period,” Manish Raj Singhania, president of FADA, told Moneycontrol. “Post-Covid, SUVs have become an extension of their drawing rooms after the lockdown era.”"

Investors must cast their net wide in automobiles and electric vehicles segments to ensure they don’t miss out on the opportunities offered by technology advancement, said Kotak Mahindra Asset Management managing director Nilesh Shah has told Moneycontrol.

Innovations and advancements in industry are now wide-ranging and one cannot be sure which ones would generate high returns for investors. So what is Shah’s solution? Put a handkerchief on every seat to secure a ride in automotive innovation, he said, an analogy to “reserving” seat in a bus or a train by using a kerchief.

Automobile innovations such as electrification, Internet of Things (IoT), Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), NCAP ratings safety, and others are gaining traction among customers.

“I don’t know whether electric vehicles (EV) are the future or something else. We will keep on building positions across all those companies which are preparing for the future,” Shah said.

The Indian EV market is projected to grow from $3.21 billion in 2022 to $113.99 billion by 2029 at a CAGR of 66.52 percent through FY 2021-29, according to Fortune Business Insights.

The EV market growth is being helped by government initiatives like hefty subsidies and state incentives. The government is pushing the demand for EVs by offering subsidies. It has set a target of 30 percent EV penetration by 2030, which has also prompted car manufacturers to invest in clean technologies.

Investors must avoid companies that are not able to make the technology transition (such as from petrol to EVs), said Shah. “These companies might do well in the near term but not in the long term,” he said.

Here are a few listed companies which deal in EVs:

In India, the electric two-wheeler (e2W) segment accounted for 56 percent of EV sales in the first 10 months of 2023. Electric three-wheelers accounted for 38 percent.

Even electric buses are gaining traction. One such company is Olectra, which recently got a Rs 10,000-crore order from the Maharashtra State Transport Corporation.

Premiumisation and technology is the near-term trend in automobiles, Shah said, adding a company could make more money for the same volume of production by upgrading their offerings.

“If a company sells an entry level car, it will probably raise Rs 5 lakh and will make a 10 percent margin on it. But if the company sells an Rs 30-lakh car, it can make Rs 3 lakh,” Shah said.

The sharp growth in profit was on the back of higher volumes as Sports Utility Vehicles (SUV) despatches remained strong fueled by order book execution and improvement in supply chain situation. The open bookings of SUVs stood at 2,86,000 units as on November 1, reflecting sustained demand, as stated by the company.

M&M’s standalone revenue in the quarter ended September 2023 rose 16.6 percent percent to Rs 25,772.7 crore from Rs 22,105 crore in the corresponding quarter of last fiscal year.

Anish Shah, Managing Director & CEO, M&M Ltd. stated that during Q2, operating performance across auto, farm and services was robust. In his view: “Auto rapidly grew to double its operating profit. Farm continues to be resilient despite tough market condition.”

The financial results exceeded analysts’ expectations, as the average estimate of five brokerage firms had said that the company's PAT will grow by over 37 percent year on-year to Rs 2,844 crore. Revenue was expected to grow by 20 percent from a year ago to Rs 24,423 crore in the July-September period, as per the estimates by the same brokerage firms.

Our E-3W business continued market leadership with 61.1percent market share,” said Jejurikar.

M&M revealed that the automotive segment witnessed a 22 percent Year-on-Year (YoY) growth in revenues at Rs 18,405.46 crore during the quarter under review. The segment’s profit jumped 88 percent to Rs 1,662.35 crore from Rs 883.11 crore YoY.

Car and tractor manufacturer Mahindra and Mahindra is expected to report a healthy rise in second-quarter earnings, led by robust automobile sales even as weak tractor sales will cap gains. The auto major will share its September quarter numbers on November 10.

While M&M’s July-September EBITDA margin is expected to grow from the previous year, most brokerages expect it to fall sequentially.

Kotak expects the auto segment EBIT margin to improve to 8 percent in Q2FY24 from 7.5 percent in the previous quarter but decline for the tractor segment by 10 basis points from the previous quarter due to negative operating leverage and higher mix of farm implement, partly offset by raw material tailwinds.

Considering a sharp fall in the previous session, the market is likely to see some consolidation and may try to take a support at the August low of 19,224, but the breaking of this support can drag it towards the psychological 19,000 mark in the near term, while any bounce-back may be seen towards 19,500-19,600 which may initially be short-lived, experts said.

On October 23, the Nifty50 dropped 261 points or 1.3 percent to 19,282, and formed a long, bearish, candlestick pattern on the daily charts after breaking not only 19,480 but also the 19,300 levels in a single session.

The BSE Sensex was down 826 points or 1.3 percent to 64,572, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices corrected more than the benchmarks, falling 2.7 percent and 3.6 percent on disappointing breadth.

Stocks that showed good performance and stayed with bulls in the falling market included Mahindra & Mahindra, CreditAccess Grameen, and BSE. Mahindra & Mahindra gained 0.4 percent at Rs 1,565 on the NSE and formed a bullish candlestick pattern with upper shadow on the daily charts, with above average volumes. The stock held above the 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) and has been consolidating around the same for last few sessions, while it continued to trade above the long upward sloping support trendline.

CreditAccess Grameen has formed long bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the daily scale, with strong volumes, indicating positive trend in the counter after consolidation for last several sessions. The stock has seen gap up opening and jumped 8.5 percent to end at record closing high of Rs 1,507 after breaking out downward sloping resistance trendline.

BSE also saw record closing high of Rs 1,707, up 7.5 percent after gap up opening, and formed bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the daily timeframe & robust volumes, which is a positive sign. The stock continued uptrend for fourth consecutive session and traded well above all key moving averages (20, 50, 100 and 200-day EMA).

Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

M&M

In the previous session Mahindra and Mahindra showed resilience in the market and closed higher inspite of benchmark going down by 1.40 percent. On the below chart, we can see the stock is in consolidation phase from July 2023. Prices have closed just above the mid band of Bollinger band.

KST (Know Sure Thing) which is a momentum indicator is just near 0 line indicating no momentum yet. The stock is having good support at Rs 1,515 levels. Overall, auto stocks are on an uptrend and is likely to have limited downside.

In short, Mahindra and Mahindra looks sideways for short term perspective and break above Rs 1,590 will open targets for Rs 1,650 with Rs 1,515 as important support.

CreditAccess Grameen

CreditAccess Grameen is trading near all-time high after healthy quarterly results. Currently, the stock is moving up in an upward sloping channel. Also, after turning above signal line, KST indicator is now moving higher suggesting that a momentum on the stock is good and is picking up.

Previously prices bounced from the channel support. One should be using dips to ride the trend for a move to Rs 1,585 levels. Prices are trading above the cloud and as long as price holds on the downside, the trend is likely to remain positive.

In short, we can expect bullish momentum to continue in this stock as long as support at Rs 1,450 is intact for a move to Rs 1,585 or higher levels.

BSE

BSE is in an uptrend and has defied the broader correction in the indices. The stock is moving in the upward moving channel and is currently in the wave 3 of an impulse pattern. We can see the stock is above the Ichimoku Cloud and has shown retest of the base line before resuming its upward journey.

KST is confirming the momentum in the counter and the stock in inching toward new highs. The positive trend is likely to continue in the stock and any dip should be used to accumulate the stock.

BSE trend is positive for a move to Rs 1,850 and if the channel resistance is broken we can expect move to Rs 2,000 levels while on the downside Rs 1,590 can act as a near term support.

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), which has an order book of close to 3 lakh units of sports utility vehicles (SUVs), is unfazed by mounting competition and says its immediate priority is ramping up the output of bestselling models, working on new products and variants, and expediting the delivery of waitlisted models.

In a neck-and-neck fight, Maruti Suzuki India overtook M&M in SUV volumes in the first half of this fiscal.

A senior M&M official said the company has been leading the revenue market share in the SUV segment for six consecutive quarters and is not intimidated by losing its market leadership in the area of “volume share”.

“Market share (in the SUV segment) keeps changing from time to time. For six quarters in a row, we've also been leaders when it comes to revenue share. So market share is a result of the launches that happened, and the demand that one has, and the capacity that one creates,” said Veejay Nakra, President, Automotive Division, M&M.

Photo finish

As per industry analysts, out of 10,01,831 SUVs sold during April-September FY24, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) became the market leader by selling 2,17,747 units cornering 21.77 percent share (184.1 percent year-on-year growth).

M&M, which has a wider SUV portfolio comprising the Scorpio-N, Scorpio Classic, XUV700, Thar, Bolero, Bolero Neo and XUV300, came close second as it sold 214,520 units and had a 21.4 percent market share during the same period (29.1 percent YoY growth).

While M&M remained the market leader by cornering a 21.5 percent share during the first quarter (April-June) by selling 1,00,050 units, its share during the second quarter (July-September) came down marginally to 21.3 percent when it sold 114,470 units.

During the last fiscal, M&M’s total volumes in the SUV space stood at 356,961 units, nearly 60 percent more than the 223,682 units sold in FY22.

Focus on profitable growth

When quizzed whether losing market leadership was worrisome for M&M, Nakra said, “We are clear that there are certain levers that we need to focus on and they are increasing our capacity, managing the supply chain well and launching new products. Obviously, our focus is on profitable growth and all these three levers will allow us to do that. Now as a result of that, we will see in the future with all the effort and the focus that we put on these three (levers), how the market share will play out.”

Nakra revealed that while the rate of inflow of bookings continues to be in the range of 48,000 to 50,000 units every month, the cancellation rate was in the range of 6-8 percent. “The booking pipeline, as we get into the festive season and even beyond that, continues to be robust. In the process, we will be ramping up our current capacity for the SUV portfolio from 39,000 units (per month) to 49,000 units (per month) by the fourth quarter of this financial year.""

M&M had earlier revealed that it will increase the manufacturing capacity of bestselling models such as Scorpio-N, XUV700 and Thar, in order to reduce their waiting periods. While the delivery time for the top-end variants of XUV7OO continues to be as high as 6 to 12 months, a buyer has to wait for 12-14 months for the Z4 and Z6 variants of Scorpio-N. Similarly, Mahindra Thar has a waiting period of 12-15 months for its Rear Wheel Drive (RWD) version.

As Nakra puts it, “We are working on two things and one (of them is) ensuring that we are increasing capacity. And the second thing is that specific to these particular models, where the waiting period is high, we are ensuring that we manage the supply chain well. So that with supplies improving and capacity increasing, we'll hopefully be able to reduce some of the waiting periods on these three models.”

New models

Nakra also said that the company has lined up a few rollouts in the next calendar year such as the 5-door version of Thar in January, followed by a mid-cycle refresh of XUV3OO and then its first Born Electric SUV-XUV.e8 in December 2024. However, he categorically stated that the company has no plans to reconsider the KUV100 micro-SUV.

Nakra also maintained that while M&M is working on six Born Electric vehicles over a three-year timeframe, it is unfazed by the market leadership position of Tata Nexon EV in the e-SUV space.

“We’ve said at the beginning of the year that in the EV space, we are going to be a little cautious as we go out with XUV4OO given that it is the first EV product in our portfolio. Our intention was to look at selling in the region of 15,000-18,000 vehicles in the first 12 months. Of course, the competition is doing what they need to do. We are on track with what our plans are for the product.”

While the company is taking rapid strides in managing the supply chain, it is still not able to optimise its production as the semiconductor supply is still not adequately met.

""The overall situation of semiconductors is far from over. From an industry perspective, it is something from whatever we read, put out by semiconductor manufacturers and leading experts on the subject, that it will probably take another 12 months before things stabilise globally on the semiconductor front. So one still needs to manage it from month to month and quarter to quarter.”"

Car sales in India reached record highs in September, driven by strong consumer demand during the festive season coupled with the rollouts of new Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) such as Honda Elevate, Citroen C3 Aircross, Tata Nexon (facelifted version), etc.

Industry analysts reckon that carmakers despatched around 3,63,733 units in September, the highest ever monthly sales in the history of the domestic passenger vehicle (PV) market. The monthly numbers of last month surpassed the all-time high wholesales numbers of August at 3,61,124 units. On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, sales were up 2.4 percent from 3,55,353 units sold in September 2022.

During July -September 2023, sales stood at 10,76,000 units, also an all-time high. During the first half of this financial year, carmakers sold 20,72,957 units , thus crossing the two million mark for the first time during the period. Furthermore, between January-September, the PV industry crossed the three million sales mark for the first time.

For the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki, at 1,81,343 units, total sales were up 2.8 percent in September, driven by higher SUV sales. Total sales in the month include domestic sales of 1,53,106 units, sales to other OEMs of 5,726 units, and exports of 22,511 units.

Shashank Srivastava, Senior Executive Officer, Marketing and Sales, Maruti Suzuki, revealed that PV sales growth has been “muted” on account of a higher base last year.

In his view, “The key reasons for the uptick in numbers (during September) are the onset of the festive season in the western and southern parts of India, and better availability of SUVs. Bookings and enquiries also remain healthy. Most of the manufacturers have gone past the semiconductor (supply) issue, and that has resulted in a lot of SUVs being produced, which was something which manufacturers, including Maruti Suzuki, were finding hard to do earlier. We are now able to ramp up production and build stocks for deliveries during Dussehra and Diwali.”

Along similar lines, Hyundai Motor India said its total sales increased 13 percent YoY to 71,641 units in September, its highest ever in a month. The country's second-largest carmaker had despatched 63,201 units to dealers in September last year.

The company’s domestic sales last month rose to 54,241 units, up 9 per cent from 49,700 units in September 2022.

""The ongoing festive season has resulted in a strong sales momentum. While the industry grew by 2 percent last month, our domestic despatches were up 9 percent. The share of SUV sales in our overall volumes continues to grow,"" stated Hyundai Motor India COO Tarun Garg.

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) also reported the sale of 41,267 SUVs last month, its highest ever, and a growth of 17 percent over the 34,262 units sold in September 2022.

According to Veejay Nakra, President, Automotive Division, M&M Ltd., “We are excited to achieve our highest-ever sales of SUVs for the third consecutive month. We also registered an overall growth of 17 percent. While demand for our key SUV brands continue to be strong, we are keeping a close watch on the availability of semiconductors and select components in order to meet the strong festive season demand.”

Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) said its sales increased 53 percent YoY to 23,590 units in September, its highest ever. The Japanese carmaker had despatched 15,378 units to dealers in the same month last year.

TKM Vice President of Sales and Strategic Marketing, Atul Sood, said the performance underlines the growing acceptance of the company's diverse product portfolio.

""We are witnessing sustained demand across our product line-up, which is leading to the company's record-breaking performance. As we move forward in the festive season, we are expecting a promising period with demand continuing to grow, thus further enhancing our sales performance,"" he added.

MG Motor India reported a 31 per cent YoY growth in retail sales, at 5,003 units in September 2023.

However, Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle sales in the domestic market, including EV (electric vehicle) sales, were down 6 percent at 44,809 units last month, compared to 47,654 units in September 2022. The Indian automaker’s EV sales, including international markets, were at 6,050 units compared to 3,864 units in the year-ago period, a growth of 57 percent.

""Passenger vehicle sales remained strong in Q2 FY23-24 driven by new launches and pre-festive offtake. Tata Motors posted quarterly sales of 1,38,939 cars and SUVs in Q2 FY23-24, about 2.7 percent below our highest ever quarter, Q2 FY22-23,"" Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Managing Director Shailesh Chandra said, and added, ""Our EV business continues its strong momentum and has posted a growth of about 55 percent YoY.""

Carmakers said they will continue to sell aggressively in October and November, when the peak of the festive season sets in with Navaratri on October 14."

Mahindra & Mahindra, on September 26, issued a statement clearing the air about an FIR filed against the company for “false assurances” on car safety. It was reported on September 23 that an FIR has been registered in Uttar Pradesh against Mahindra Group chairperson Anand Mahindra, along with 12 others, after a man who lost his son to a car accident filed a complaint.

The automaker, in its statement, has clarified that the case is more than 18 months old, and the reported incident occurred in January 2022.

Commenting on allegations that the vehicle did not have airbags, the company said, ""We would hence like to categorically reconfirm that the Scorpio S9 variant manufactured in 2020 did have airbags"".

It noted that M&M has investigated the case and found no malfunction of the airbags. ""It was a rollover case which would not deploy the frontal airbags,"" the company stated.

According to M&M, the company carried out a detailed technical investigation in October 2022.

In the FIR, Kanpur's Rajesh Mishra claimed that he bought a black Scorpio worth Rs 17.40 lakh after being convinced of its safety features promoted by advertisements and social media posts by Mahindra. He gifted the car to his son Apoorv Mishra, who allegedly died after he met with a car accident, as the airbags supposed to be installed in the car did not deploy.

The automaker, in its statement, said that the matter is currently sub judice, and it is ""committed to cooperating with the authorities for any further investigation""."

Equity benchmarks as well as broader markets are expected to consolidate in the coming days with the Nifty50 likely to move in the 20,200-19,900 range. The decisively breaching on either side of the range may give a firm direction to the market and, till then, the consolidation may susatain, at least till the outcome of two-day Fed policy meeting scheduled on September 20, experts said.

On September 18, the Nifty50 slipped 59 points to 20,133, and the BSE Sensex declined over 240 points to 67,597, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices corrected four-tenth of a percent and half a percent.

The key sectors were under pressure with the Bank Nifty declining more than 250 points to 45,980, while the Nifty IT shed 225 points to 33,130 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts.

Stocks that outperformed broader markets included Bank of Baroda, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Yes Bank. Bank of Baroda remained above the falling trendline for third straight session, rising more than 3 percent to Rs 217 and formed bullish candlestick pattern with minor upper shadow on the daily timeframe, with above average volumes. The stock remained above all key moving averages.

Mahindra & Mahindra hit a historic high on Monday after breakout of upward sloping resistance trendline and traded with strong volumes on last two sessions. The stock gained 2.5 percent to end at record closing high of Rs 1,641.5 and formed bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the daily charts, indicating some profit booking at higher levels.

Yes Bank has seen above average volumes for major part of sessions since the start of September month and also took a support at the long downward sloping resistance trendline, which is a positive sign. The stock rose 1.4 percent to Rs 18.55 and formed bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow and minor lower shadow on the daily charts.

The market was shut on Tuesday, September 19, for Ganesh Chaturthi.

Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Mahindra and Mahindra

The stock is moving well within upward sloping channel. Recently prices bounced back on the upside by taking support of the channel. So, with follow up buying we can expect a move towards the channel resistance which is near Rs 1,780-1,800 levels.

On the other hand, prices bounced back from the Ichimoku Cloud. So, Cloud can act as a near term support which is near Rs 1,540 levels. Along with this, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has also turned bullish by showing a positive crossover. In short, all the signs are suggesting that further bullish momentum is likely to continue in this stock.

Any break above Rs 1,670 can take price further higher with the target of Rs 1,800, while on the downside, Rs 1,540 can act as a near term support.

Yes Bank

In the previous session (September 18), Yes Bank showed a good rally just like its peer companies. Also, mid bands continued to act as a support cushion to prices and for now mid band can act as near-term support which comes near Rs 17.6 levels. Prices are facing resistance near Rs 19 level as prices failed to give a close above the same since last 4 times.

In short, overall, outlook for Yes bank looks positive. Any daily close above Rs 19 is must for further bullish momentum to continue and then we can expect a move towards Rs 21-22, while Rs 17.6 can act as a near term support.

Bank of Baroda

On the daily chart, prices have formed a rounding bottom pattern which is a bullish pattern. The break out of the pattern occurred two session prior and after retesting prices bounced back on the upside.

Traders who already holding position in this particular stock should hold with a stop-loss of Rs 207. Whereas someone looking for making new positions should use any dips towards Rs 213 as a buying opportunity for the target Rs 230 as RSI (relative strength index) is trading in overbought zone and we need RSI to cool down.

The market went on a rally since the start of September and recorded nearly 5 percent gains so far. It hit a historic high and zoomed 1.9 percent last week. This is, therefore, the time for the market to see some retraction and some bearish divergence too, with price making higher highs, and momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) making lower highs on the daily charts. A similar situation is seen on the weekly charts as well.

The Nifty50 may see some consolidation and correction, taking support at the 20,000-19,900 area, whereas a rebound after the possible correction may take the index towards 20,500 mark, experts said.

The index jumped 372 points last week to 20,192 points and formed a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above-average volumes for the third straight week.

""Indicators have entered the overbought zone, and the daily chart displays small-body candles, suggesting some signs of fatigue among the bulls,"" Sameet Chavan, research head for technical and derivatives at Angel One, said.

He feels that the next leg of up-move may not be as swift as recent times, potentially involving in-between pauses or price corrections. The overall sentiment remains positive, and the advisable approach is to view dips as buying opportunities, he said.

In this scenario, he feels the previous resistance of around 20,000 is likely to act as an immediate support, while Tuesday's panic low of 19,900 remains a critical pivot point. On the other hand, in the uncharted territory, the next resistance zone lies in the 20,400-20,500 range.

In the coming sessions, Jigar Patel, senior manager for equity research at Anand Rathi, also feels that 20,400 might act as an immediate hurdle for the Nifty50 since that is the placement of a rising trendline. On the downside, 20,000–19,000 now might be a decisive support for the short term.

Since the broader markets are overstretched, failing to clear the high might trigger some profit-booking. Thus, he advised traders to remain extremely stock-specific and follow strict stop-losses.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas from experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the September 8 closing prices.

Expert: Viraj Vyas, CMT, Technical & Derivatives Analyst - Institutional Equity at Ashika Stock Broking

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,601 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,520 | Target: Rs 1,800 | Return: 12.4 percent

This stock stands out as one of the top performers in the auto sector, which has experienced a significant and robust upward trend from April 2023 to July 2023. During this period, the stock surged from Rs 1,100 levels to Rs 1,600 levels.

Subsequently, the stock transitioned into a consolidation phase, forming what appears to be an Ascending Triangle pattern. It's worth noting that this pattern is typically considered bullish in nature. A potential breakout above the Rs 1,605-1,610 levels is anticipated to initiate the next leg of its upward move.

Union Bank of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 96 | Stop-Loss: Rs 86 | Target: Rs 120 | Return: 25 percent

Among the banking sector, particularly in PSU banking stocks, there has been a notable surge in momentum in recent weeks. Many of these stocks, including Union Bank, had been consolidating for an extended period. In the case of Union Bank, the stock had been in consolidation mode from 2019 until around 2023. This consolidation phase has taken the form of a Cup and Handle pattern, which is typically indicative of accumulation and a potential bottoming out process.

Notably, in the previous week, there was a significant increase in trading volumes, suggesting that the stock is poised to break above its resistance area and potentially initiate a strong upward move, targeting Rs 120-125 zone.

Coforge: Buy | LTP: Rs 5,619 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,350 | Target: Rs 6,300 | Return: 12 percent

The stock has exhibited robust performance over the past few weeks, capitalizing on the strong performance of Nifty IT stocks, even as the broader market approaches the end of a two-year corrective phase. During its ascent, the stock has been shaping a rounding pattern, and it recently achieved a breakout above the golden ratio of a prior downward move (Rs 4,500-3,250).

Maintaining levels above Rs 5,350 indicates a favourable outlook for the ongoing upward trend, and the stock is poised to target Rs 6,200-6,300 range. While a minor obstacle may be encountered around Rs 6,000 levels, the overall trajectory remains promising.

Expert: Vinay Rajani, CMT, senior technical & derivative analyst at HDFC Securities

Canara Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 365 | Stop-Loss: Rs 350 | Target: Rs 399 | Return: 9 percent

The stock price has broken out from downward sloping trendline on the monthly chart. Price breakout is accompanied with a jump in volumes. Stock price is trading above its 20, 50 and 200 DMA, indicating bullish trend on all time frame.

Indicators and oscillators like MACD (moving average convergence divergence) and RSI (relative strength index) have turned bullish on the monthly charts. Nifty PSU Bank index has broken out from the consolidation.

UPL: Buy | LTP: Rs 634.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 602 | Targets: Rs 680-720 | Return: 13 percent

The stock price has broken out from bullish Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern on the daily chart. Stock has surpassed the crucial resistance of 5-day EMA (exponential moving average). Price breakout is accompanied with jump in volumes. Indicators and oscillators have turned bullish on the daily charts. Chemical sector has started outperforming for last two weeks.

Triveni Turbine: Buy | LTP: Rs 433.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 410 | Targets: Rs 480-520 | Return: 20 percent

The stock price has broken out from the multi-week consolidation. Price breakout is accompanied by jump in volumes. Stock is trading above all important moving averages, which indicates bullish trend on all time frames. Stock price has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms on weekly charts.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, head of research (retail) at Kotak Securities

Zydus Lifesciences: Buy | LTP: Rs 645 | Stop-Loss: Rs 620 | Targets: Rs 675-700 | Return: 8.5 percent

The stock market is currently displaying a bullish trend and is trading above all significant averages. Furthermore, it has formed a Flag formation that suggests the bullish trend would persist.

Therefore, it is anticipated that the stock could increase to Rs 675, which was the previous all-time high. In an optimal scenario, it may even reach Rs 700 if it surpasses the previous high. If you wish to take a long position in the stock, it is advisable to set a stop loss at Rs 620.

DCW: Buy | LTP: Rs 58.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 53 | Targets: Rs 66-75 | Return: 28 percent

The stock is breaking out of a multi-year resistance level and has formed a symmetrical triangle on the long-term charts. Recently, the stock closed below the upper boundary of the triangle formation. However, we believe that it is now ready to move towards the target based on the triangle pattern.

According to the triangle formation, the stock may reach upward levels of Rs 66, Rs 75, and Rs 90 in the medium to long term. We suggest buying at the present level and placing a stop loss at Rs 53 to minimize potential losses.

Tata Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 132 | Stop-Loss: Rs 126 | Targets: Rs 140-145 | Return: 10 percent

The sector is a bright spot in the current economic climate, playing a significant role in the overall growth. Tata Steel, in particular, stands out with exceptional performance in the same category.

Notably, it formed a continuation high before breaking out of a trading range of Rs 133 last Thursday. Based on technical analysis, the next levels to watch for are Rs 140 and Rs 145, respectively. It is advisable to consider buying at current levels, with a stop loss set at Rs 126.

Expert: Mitesh Karwa, research analyst at Bonanza Portfolio

ICICI Prudential Life Insurance: Buy | LTP: Rs 595 | Stop-Loss: 560 | Target: Rs 654 | Return: 10 percent

The stock has seen breaking out of a bullish pattern on the weekly timeframe after almost two years with a big bullish candlestick and above average volumes, adding to it the stock is trading and sustaining above all its important EMAs which can be used as a confluence towards the bullish view.

On the indicator front, the Ichimoku Cloud is also suggesting a bullish move as the price is trading above the conversion line, base line and cloud. Momentum oscillator RSI (14) is at around 64 on the daily time frame indicating strength by sustaining above 50.

Observation of the above factors indicates that a bullish move in stock is possible for target upto Rs 654. One can initiate a buy trade in between the range of Rs 590-595 stop-loss of Rs 560 on daily closing basis.

Bandhan Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 249 | Stop-Loss: Rs 235 | Target: Rs 270 | Return: 8 percent

Tata Motors Ltd will continue to roll out diesel-driven variants of its existing models like Altoz, Harrier, Safari and the facelifted Nexon as long as favourable market dynamics and regulations permit, said a top company official.

""We aim to be net zero by 2040, which means a fast acceleration of EVs (electric vehicles). At the same time, thousands of people want diesel engine models. So, as an OEM (original equipment manufacturer), our policy is simple. We will keep adapting to the market and regulations. We will continue making diesel vehicles till there is demand,"" said Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility.

Chandra’s remarks came days after Union Minister for Road Transport Nitin Gadkari urged the auto industry to stop producing vehicles running on ""polluting diesel"". He also stated that he would request Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to levy a ""10 percent additional tax"" on all types of diesel vehicles, such as cars, tractors and construction equipment. Gadkari, however, clarified half an hour later that there is no such proposal under ""active consideration"".

Chandra also said that the company had phased out many diesel-fired passenger vehicles (PVs) in the past and the existence of any technology will be governed by the prevailing regulations.

""When the regulatory requirements become so stringent that a certain powertrain cannot exist, we will follow that. We now have diesel models in only a few segments, and maybe those too will come under further pressure after BS-VII, and we will have to discontinue them. So, we will follow the market forces, and we will follow what the government brings in,"" added Chandra.

He was also of the view that other companies should foray into EVs to contribute to green mobility. However, he didn’t specify the names of the companies.

""We have shown the biggest commitment to what the government wants, which is EVs. Unfortunately, people are talking about diesel and not asking manufacturers who are not moving to EVs, but we are asking questions about diesel. Diesel will decline on its own,"" Chandra further added.

Like Tata Motors, another homegrown automaker, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M), had also categorically stated that it will not be walking away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, especially diesel engines. Japanese carmaker Toyota Motor Corporation also stated that it will not shun diesel engines from its portfolio.

Industry analysts reckon that diesel vehicles have higher fuel efficiency and are an important part of last-mile mobility. ""If we look at recent numbers, entry-segment cars and hatchbacks are posting negative numbers, while robust growth is happening in the utility vehicle (UV) segment. For bigger vehicles, higher fuel efficiency vehicles have a significant dependence on diesel, be it the Hyundai Alcazar, Tata Harrier, Hyundai Creta, or Mahindra Bolero, even though they remain under constant pressure from stringent emission norms,"" stated Gaurav Vangaal, Associate Director, S&P Global Mobility.

Domestic sales of diesel vehicles in India have nosedived since the price of the fuel was deregulated in 2014. As per industry estimates, nearly 18 percent of all passenger vehicles sold in the domestic market in FY23 comprised diesel models compared to 53 percent in FY14."

Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (M&M) is strategically aiming to strengthen positioning in the overseas market via the introduction of global products. The company unveiled OJA (tractor platform), Thar.e (electric SUV) and Global PikUp (pick up vehicle) to cater to domestic as well as export markets.

The automobile major added that the inspections are being conducted for a possible risk of abrasion cut of the wiring loom.

The leading car maker in India, Mahindra has created a buzz in the auto industry after showcasing the electric Thar concept, Scorpio-based pickup, tractors, and products on August 14 in Cap Town. During the event, the company also confirmed that soon it will introduce an electric version of Bolero and Scorpio, which will feature the same e’ moniker as the concept Thar.

While breaking the covers from the company’s new logo for its e-SUV segment at the event, Mahindra’s CEO for the auto and Farm sector, Rajesh Jejurikar said that over a period of time, the company will turn all the internal combustion engines into electric.

Now, here comes the biggest question, what one should expect from the upcoming e-Scorpio and e-Bolero? The report says there is a high chance that both vehicles might feature an RWD set-up, and the company might source the motor from Volkswagen. However, customers can also expect the Scorpio.e with an all-wheel drive option, featuring dual-motor arrangements.

EV Scorpio and Bolero Platform

Talking about the platform, it is expected that both the king-size SUV might use the P1 version of the INGLO platform, the same one that has been used in Thar.e which will allow both vehicles to have off-road capabilities.

EV Scorpio and Bolero Launch

As far as the launch is concerned, the company already hinted that they are lined up to introduce four born EV SUVs between the end of 2024 to mid-2026, which means the electric SUVs are liekly to hit the market during the mentioned time period.

While there was no launch timeline given for these two SUVs, Mahindra has already confirmed as many as four born EV SUVs that will launch between December 2024 and April 2026, which means a market launch of the Scorpio.e and Bolero.e is only likely to take place after April 2026.

Amid this, introducing or turning these SUVs into electric does not mean the company will stop the ICE powertrains of the models. Mahindra continues to provide the fuel-powered engine, featuring ladder-frame chassis in both SUVs.

ICE Scorpio and Bolero

The Scorpio Classic, Scorpio N, and the Bolero line-up will continue to be sold with ICE powertrains underpinned by ladder-frame chassis. These models are major cash cows for Mahindra in the Indian market, which is why the brand will continue to offer both petrol and diesel iterations of these SUVs, and will further invest in these brands and their respective ladder-frame platforms."

Mahindra Tractors, a division of the Mahindra Group and a leading global tractor manufacturer, on August 15 launched its technologically advanced line of tractors. Mahindra OJA was launched in Cape Town, South Africa, promising to revolutionise farming.

The Indian company introduced a series of new tractors based on four OJA platforms: sub-compact, compact, small utility and large utility.

The sub-compact model is designed specifically for the USA market whereas the compact and small utility models will be available for the US, India and ASEAN. The large utility tractor will be unveiled a year from now.

Under OJA's compact and small utility platforms, the company introduced seven new tractor models for the Indian market, all equipped with standard 4WD.

These models cover a power range of 20HP to 40HP (14.91kW to 29.82kW), offering exceptional platform versatility and effectiveness to manage a wide range of agricultural tasks, it said.

The Mahindra OJA 27 HP tractor will be priced at Rs 5.64 lakh against its competitor at Rs 5.82 lakh. Additionally, Mahindra OJA 40HP tractor will be priced at Rs 7.35 lakh against its competitor which is also priced the same.

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M reported in-line results in terms of revenue and margin, though Company logged a ~42% beat at the PAT level due to higher ‘other income’. While we are unenthused about the recent RBL Bank investment amid appreciable capital allocation focus over the past few years, current valuations (~14x core FY25E PER) remain supportive amid relatively limited volume growth prospects in base businesses (we build ~8%/~5% volume CAGR in Auto and Farm segments).

Outlook

We introduce FY26 estimates and upgrade FY24E/FY25E EPS by ~9%/~7% to reflect the Q1 margin performance and outlook (FY23E-25E Core EPS CAGR: ~14%); we maintain BUY on M&M, given the undemanding valuations (~14x FY25E standalone core PER). Our SOTP-based TP stands at Rs1,590/share (Rs1,500 earlier; incl. Rs470/sh for subsidiaries/investments).

HDFC Securities' research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M Q1 adjusted PAT came in at INR 21.2 bn, ahead of our estimate of INR 19.3bn, led by better-than-expected margins. The margin surprise was driven by improved performance from the tractor segment. On the back of strong demand for its models, M&M has gained a 200bps share to 18.3% in UVs as of Q1FY24. Also, while industry demand is slowly decelerating, M&M continues to enjoy a healthy order backlog at 281k units. In the upto 3.5T LCV segment, while demand is subdued, M&M has further strengthened its market share to 49% (+480bps YoY). Even in tractors, M&M has been able to gain 20bps share to 42.9% in Q1 with improved profitability. We continue to remain positive on the business momentum, given: (1) a strong order backlog for UVs will help further gain market share; (2) the target to further increase its market share in tractors on the back of new launches; (3) focused strides taken to achieve a strong position in EVs; (4) challenge set for growth gems to grow 5x. While the recent stake buy of RBL posed serious concerns around capital allocation, we believe as long as they continue to focus on their core business segments and work towards achieving their long-term targets, investors should not be too concerned.

Outlook

Maintain BUY, with a revised TP of INR1,674/sh (earlier at INR1,617/share) as we roll forward to June’25 EPS.

Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Mahindra & Mahindra

M&M rallied following strong quarterly results and also broking houses upgraded their target levels on the stock. The stock is moving up by following simple Elliott wave theory. Wherein, currently primary wave 3 is ongoing on the upside which is considered as a strongest. Auto sector has been outperforming over past few months in a secular uptrend.

Along with this, Ichimoku Cloud is acting as a strong support and recently as well prices bounced back from this support levels. As per this, nearest support for M&M is near Rs 1,395 levels for a move towards Rs 1,700 levels which is the channel resistance.

Finolex Cables

Finolex Cables prices are moving well within an upward sloping channel. We can see that after reversing from the lower end of the channel, stock witnessed a good rally. Moving average crossover system is working well and as long as prices stay above both 20-day and 50-day MA (moving average) the trend remains positive.

From risk reward perspective, it is better to use dips opportunity to enter into this stock with support at Rs 975 for a move to Rs 1,130.

Poly Medicure

In the previous session, Polymed formed a huge Bullish candle. The stock has closed above Rs 1,315 level which confirms breakout of the rounding bottom pattern. After retesting the neckline stock has bounced back on the upside which is deemed to be a positive sign.

Also, wave 4 got completed near Rs 650 levels and since then stock has rallied by more than 129 percent. Currently prices are moving up in form of wave 5.

KST (know sure thing) has turned above signal line and also trading above zero line suggesting that further good momentum is likely to continue.

In nutshell, one can use dips as a buying opportunity to ride the trend with targets of Rs 1,550 as long as Rs 1,295 holds on the downside.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

We increase our FY24/FY25 EPS estimate by c13%/8% to factor in higher ASP, margin beat, higher other income. M&M’s 1QFY24 revenue came above our and consensus estimate, led by higher-than-expected ASPs at the Automotive segment. EBITDA margin at 13.4% came above our estimate of 12.7%, and largley in line with consensus. Management noted that commodity costs have softened and should support margins, coupled with better mix, operating leverage and price hikes. Suppply issues have normalised and MM is on track to reach 49k unit exit SUV capacity for FY24. MM noted no change in capital allocation policy and tried to calm investor concerns with detailed presentation on the same, which we think should help in investor confidence. M&M should benefit from (1) growing customer preference for SUV, (2) ramp-up in production to fulfill strong demand and order book, (3) market share gains in the tractor industry from new segments, (4) ramp-up in EV portfolio starting 2025.

Outlook

What analysts are saying

Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited (MOFSL) has said that while the outlook for tractors remains stable, it is expected that the auto business to be the key growth driver for the next couple of years.

The company's profit before interest and tax (PBIT) rose 40 basis points year-on-year. Analysts at the firm predict that M&M will outperform both, the auto and farmer equipment segments, as it has a major share of high-end SUVs wherein demand is relatively better and tractors launches in the lightweight category through OJA and Swaraj are on the cards.

Nuvama Institutional Equities expect healthy growth momentum with a 14 percent revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over FY23–25, supported by robust growth in the auto segment and moderate growth in the farm segment. Besides, better net pricing in the auto segment shall boost profitability, driving core earnings CAGR of 20 percent over FY23–25.

Goldman Sachs analysts suggest that the farm segment operating profit topped its estimate. Furthermore, easing commodity prices will also prove to be crucial in the coming quarters.

JP Morgan has said that the management indicated that they are not considering further capital infusion in the next 2-3 years. The company executives reiterated that free cash flow from the auto and farm segment won't be invested elsewhere. ""This should alleviate investor concerns on the capital allocation for now"", an analyst at JP Morgan added.

LKP Securities is of the view that the company's SUVs will continue to shine, maintaining their impressive performance. The company has received a positive reception for the new Scorpio N, notching up 117,000 bookings since its launch. The Thar and XUV 700 launches continue to generate demand as well. The Neo Bolero, introduced in July 2021, has already garnered significant order bookings (9,000 monthly bookings for the entire Bolero family) and has made notable inroads into Southern markets where the previous Bolero model had limited presence.

As far as its stake in RBL is concerned, the management said that the financial services business is a core area for M&M. This investment is based on a long-term view (7-10 years), with an objective to understand banking, which will enable it to enhance the value of its financial services business.

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M), which claims to have the maximum revenue market share among SUVs (sports utility vehicles), said that it has open orders for over 2.81 lakh such vehicles as of 1st August, 2023. To address this, the company is ramping up production by 25 per cent, to 49,000 units per month by FY23-end, from 39,000 currently.

M&M revealed that it has managed to sell over 1.86 lakh SUVs during Q1 FY24, the highest in a quarter. The Mumbai-based automaker’s vehicle sales during the period were up 21 percent from the year prior.

“We have open bookings for 2,81,000 units in spite of the ramp in production because of the strong demand for our newer models,” stated Rajesh Jejurikar, Executive Director and CEO, Auto and Farm, at Mahindra & Mahindra.

M&M said that the lifestyle SUV Thar currently has over 68,000 open bookings and continues to clock about 10,000 bookings a month across its two-wheel drive (2WD) and four-wheel drive (4WD) variants. Mahindra's Scorpio brand of models, which includes the Scorpio Classic and the Scorpio N, have over 1.17 lakh open bookings, and together clock 14,000 units per month.

The XUV7OO sees 8,000 bookings a month and has over 77,000 open orders at the moment. The popular Bolero line-up, including the standard Bolero and the Bolero Neo, have around 8,400 pending orders.

“There are certain brands that continue to be very strong (on bookings). Overall, we’re seeing about 48,000 new bookings a month,” added Jejurikar.

Prolonged wait

Jejurikar said that the huge order book has resulted in a protracted waiting period, varying from 5-6 months for some models, to about a year-and-a-half for others.

“The waiting period varies by model. For the Thar 2WD variant, which is right now the most in demand, it's over a year-and-a-half. Thar as a brand is doing very well. The launch of the 2WD variant helped build the brand further. The Thar 4WD has a waiting period of five months,” explained Jejurikar while responding to a media query.

He further said that the top-end version of XUV7OO commands a wait period of close to a year, and added that the wait for a Scorpio N also goes up to over a year.

“XUV7OO and Scorpio were the most affected by the semiconductor crisis, especially with regard to the chips in the airbag control unit. But that is behind us now, and we would be ramping up production of both of these over the next few months,” said Jejurikar.

Last month, the company billed around 37,000 units, or about 95 percent of its total production capacity. Jejurikar added that though the semiconductor crisis is nearly over, the industry is not completely out of the woods.

“We are producing at the full capacity of 39,000 units (per month), and our sales are very close to that. We will produce 49,000 (units per month) by the end of this financial year,” Jejurikar added. However, he maintained, “There might be surprises on the semiconductor front, which we are not able to see at the moment. But we believe most known issues are behind us. And our supply chain is robust for now.”"

Mahindra and Mahindra on August 4 said it does not expect to invest more in the private sector lender RBL Bank unless it sees “compelling strategic value"". The automaker recently acquired a 3.53 percent stake for Rs 417 crore and said it may increase it further.

""While we have mentioned that we may consider increasing our stake to 9.9 percent, we do not expect to invest more unless we see compelling strategic value at some point in the future,"" the company said in a statement after reporting an impressive set of numbers for the June quarter of the current financial year.

The investment in RBL was based on a long-term view (7-10 years). ""The primary purpose is to understand banking, which will enable us to enhance the value of our financial services business,"" it said.

Two days later, M&M officials meet RBL Bank executives.

Post the stake buy, M&M shares nosedived 6 percent to Rs 1,450 at about 9:20 am on July 27 after six lakh crore shares changed hands on the NSE. This is the biggest single-day drop for M&M since February 2022.

Meanwhile, shares of RBL had reacted positively to the news as the stock has gained 3.4 percent at 10:25 am on July 27.

""The move is not welcomed by the market because banking is not a core business for M&M. Market expects them to deploy money in the core business especially when the company is doing well. Putting cash in a non-core business is against the company's philosophy,"" Varun Baxi, analyst at Antique Stock Broking told Moneycontrol. ""RBL is anyway not a pristine asset to invest in.""

Mahindra & Mahindra’s net profit surged 98 percent year-on-year (YOY) in the first quarter of FY24 on the back of a rich product mix and upbeat sales of sports utility vehicles, exceeding analysts’ expectations.

Standalone profit climbed to Rs 2,774 crore in the three months ended June from Rs 1,404 crore a year earlier. Revenue from operations increased 23 percent to Rs 24,368 crore, the Mumbai-based auto manufacturer said in a statement on August 4.

According to a poll of five brokerages, profit was expected to be Rs 1,865 crore, up 27 percent from a year ago. Revenue was estimated to be 20 percent higher at Rs 23,457 crore.

Analysts said an increase in the average selling price and softening commodity prices aided Mahindra & Mahindra’s robust performance.

Other income rose to Rs 658 crore from Rs 140 crore in the year-ago quarter. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 46.5 per cent to Rs 3,547 crore, while the EBITDA margin improved to 14.6 percent from 12.2 percent.

“During Q1, our businesses across auto, farm and services delivered a strong performance,” Anish Shah, managing director of M&M, said in the statement. “Auto led the way by strengthening its market leadership position and doubling its operating profit.”

The M&M stock fell 0.2 percent to Rs 1,465.05 at the close on the BSE.

SUV leader

Automotive sales at the maker of the Thar, Bolero and XUV range of vehicles rose 21 percent to 186,000 units, the highest ever for the first quarter. The business recorded an increase in EBIT margin to 7.5 percent from 5.3 percent.

However, tractor sales fell 3 percent to 114,293 units. The company's farm equipment segment margin improved to 17.5 percent from 15.9 percent.

“In SUVs, we continue to be leaders in revenue market share for the sixth consecutive quarter with SUV volume crossing the 100,000 milestone. In the tractor business, we have achieved 42.9 percent market share, the highest since Q2 of FY20,” said Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director of the auto and farm sector.

The company’s electric three-wheeler business continued its market leadership with a 65.5 percent share, he said.

M&M business divisions include automobiles, farm, financial services and consumer services.

“Our consolidated results reflect the robust performance of our multiple businesses,” said Manoj Bhat, group chief financial officer. “We have also realised the benefits of value creation through our capital allocation actions. Our market leadership position in our automotive and farm businesses have helped us realise operating margin benefits.”

M&M recently acquired a 3.53 percent stake for Rs 417 crore and said it may increase it to 9.9 percent.

The company said it does not expect to invest more in private sector lender RBL Bank unless it sees “compelling strategic value"" at some point in the future.

Shah said the RBL Bank investment did not mean that the company’s capital allocation discipline has changed. In a presentation, M&M said the investment was based on a long-term view of 7-10 years.

The Indian automaker said that it made the investment with a view to understand more of the financial services and banking business and not with any objective of foraying into the banking sector.

“The primary purpose is to understand banking, which will enable us to enhance the value of our financial services business. We saw an opportunity with an attractive valuation at less than 1x P/B for a very solid bank with a strong management team. We will explore potential for synergies as well,"" M&M said."

The stock is trading into a rising channel pattern after reversal from the lower levels and forming the higher lows series continuously on the weekly scale. The strong bullish momentum suggests that the counter is likely to maintain bullish continuation chart formation in the coming horizon.

For traders, Rs 1,490 would act as an important support zone while Rs 1,660 could be the key resistance area for the short-term traders. However, below Rs 1,490 level the uptrend would be vulnerable.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M’s 4QFY23 revenue came above our and consensus estimate, led by higher-than-expected ASPs (at Rs 809k, +5.3% QoQ). However, EBITDA margin at 12.4% came below our estimate of 12.8%, due to higher mix of auto segment and impact from farm machinery in FES segment. Management noted that commodity costs have softened and should support margins, but noted that semiconductor shortage continues to impact volumes at around c3k unit per month. MM guided for low signle digit growt in tractors led by positive enablers and government spending, furthermore, it aims to grow its farm machinery sales 10x by 2027 (c38% growth in FY23). M&M should benefit, given (1) growing customer preference for SUV, (2) capacity ramp-up to fulfill strong order book, (3) market share gains in the tractor industry, (4) strong response to EV portfolio (XUV4OO).



Outlook

Also, benign RM, operating leverage and end of volume of introductory priced model would benefit margins (we buil-in 140bps expansion over FY23-25E). Our EPS estimates remain largely unchanged. Retain ‘BUY’ with TP of Rs 1,585 (18x on Mar-25E core EPS and Rs 331 for subsidiaries).

Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), which reported a 22 percent rise in net profit in the fourth quarter (Q4) of the financial year 2022-23 (FY23), said it is unable to ramp up output of its sports utility vehicles (SUVs) due to semiconductor chip shortage. India’s largest maker of utility vehicles, which had ramped up its total output to 39,000 per month, saw production slide by 15-17 percent in the last quarter of FY23.

Rajesh Jejurikar, Chief Executive of Mahindra’s auto and farm businesses, said in a post-earnings call that the company is facing some issues on the semiconductor front, which is impacting the ramp-up of Scorpio-N, Thar and XUV700.

""We are not clearly out of it, and my guess would be that about 15-17 percent of our output getting impacted. We had put out a capacity expansion plan, and that's been done. The gap that we're seeing right now between the actual volume (and the volume achieved) is not (due to a lack of) capacity but (because of) specific semiconductor shortages, which may be impacting the ability to get to 39,000 (units per month). There will be short-term issues around some semiconductors not being available, which may impact us.""

M&M registered a 22% increase in its net profit of Rs 1,549 crore for the quarter ended March, up from Rs 1,268 crore in the base quarter. Revenue for the quarter came at Rs 22,571,4 crore, up 31 percent from Rs 17,237 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal.

In its bid to bring down the waiting periods for its bestselling models, M&M will be scaling up production capacity by 10,000 units per annum at its facilities within the next six months.

""The next wave of capacity increase will be six to seven months later, which is when we will go from 39,0000 to 49,000 (units per month), which is when the XUV700 and Scorpio (-N) will move from their current capacity of 6,000 to 10,000 units per month. Hopefully, over the next six months, we'll start seeing the number of open bookings come down,"" explained Jejurikar.

As per Jejurikar, the chip shortage situation is going to be a ‘wait-and-watch’ scenario over the next few quarters.

""(We have taken) action, which is allowing us to get to 33,000-34,000 units a month from 18,000 units a year and a half back. We now have products in our portfolio like the XUV700, which has more than 200 chips per unit. So, there is that much more vulnerability to disruption, which could come from multiple sources. We have taken multiple sets of actions, including starting to build an inventory of our own semiconductors and not just relying on the suppliers to build inventory,"" he added.

M&M has no immediate plans to make cells for its electric vehicle (EV) batteries on its own and is still evaluating production through its Volkswagen tie-up, Jejurikar said. It currently buys batteries from a Korean supplier.

Meanwhile, M&M has slightly raised its capex by Rs 825 crore for the three years ending FY24 as it anticipates buoyancy in the domestic SUV, farm equipment, and EV market segments. The company had earlier earmarked a capex of Rs 15,075 crore for the three years ending FY24.

Thanks to the sound demand outlook going forward, the company is raising the forecast for capex for the same period (FY22-24), Manoj Bhat, Group Chief Financial Officer at M&M, told reporters in a post-Q4 earnings announcement interaction. ""Overall, at the net level, in the same period (FY22-24) the number which was Rs 15,075 crore is now Rs 15,900 crore."""

(image credit pixabay)

As the economy gains momentum and vehicle output witnesses a new record, leading passenger-vehicle makers have lined up big-ticket investments in excess of Rs 1,20,000 crore for the next few years, as per the data collated from all the companies. Credit rating agency ICRA claims that the capex outlay for OEMs is estimated to be Rs 65,000 crore for the next two fiscal years alone, with OEMs budgeting for a substantial outlay towards capacity creation and product development, including development of capabilities/platforms for electric vehicles.

The total amount earmarked by all OEMs is in addition to Rs 20,000 crore that carmakers such as Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M), etc. are spending on building additional capacities for Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEV) to meet unmet demand.

The confidence stems from the fact that passenger vehicle sales reached nearly 4 million and are projected to post 10-15% CAGR over the next few years . For instance, CRISIL, in its latest report, claims that overall passenger vehicle (PV) sales will grow 9-10% this fiscal year to nearly 50 lakh units, scaling a new all-time high. This will be nearly 20% above the pre-pandemic peak of 40.5 lakh units. This fiscal year will also see the highest-ever sales by domestic PV original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the research agency projects.

A healthy order book driven by pent-up demand and higher incomes, especially of sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and better availability of semiconductors, will support domestic growth, though exports remain sluggish, the CRISIL report said.

“Several OEMs are scaling-up their investments to develop electric vehicles (EV), including hybrid platforms; while initial EV launches were based on the existing ICE platforms, the OEMs are now developing greenfield platforms for EVs to accommodate optimum battery capacity and ensure light weighting,” said Rohan Kanwar Gupta, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited. “A majority of the capex outlay (including product development) will be met through healthy cash accruals/parent funding support, apart from inorganic fund raise in some of the recently formed EV subsidiaries.”

Here’s a look at how various OEMs are lining up capex for the coming years.

Hyundai

Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL recently announced that it would invest Rs 20,000 crore in a phased manner in Tamil Nadu over the next ten years to make “further inroads into electric vehicles” and “modernisation of vehicle platforms”.

The South Korean carmaker revealed that the earmarked amount, which will be funded through internal accruals, will partly go towards establishing a battery pack assembly facility with an annual capacity of 1,78,000 units.

“The investment demonstrates our long-term commitment towards the Indian market and how we intend to stay ahead of the curve for e-mobility,” Puneet Anand, AVP & Group Head — Corporate Affairs, Hyundai Motor India Ltd., told Moneycontrol over the phone. “We will be making multiple announcements in the near term and it will all be part of the total Rs 20,000 crore we have earmarked,” he added.

He also clarified that some portion of the proposed capex will be spent on ramping up total production volumes to 8.5 lakh units a year and introducing new electric and internal combustion engine vehicles from its factory in Sriperumbudur, outside Chennai.

Tata Motors

Homegrown automaker Tata Motors has enhanced its investment outlay for the current financial year by 27.7 percent to Rs 38,000 crore . The Mumbai-based automaker, which had invested Rs 30,000 crore last year, will be deploying the funds towards product and platform development for electric vehicles (EVs) and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), and freeing up capacity.

“The total capex during the current (financial) year will be almost Rs 38,000 crore, out of which it will be about Rs 30,000 crore or £3 billion in JLR and Rs 8,000 crore in Tata Motors’ PV division,” revealed PB Balaji, Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Tata Motors, while speaking to reporters in a post-Q4 earnings call.

Renault and Nissan

Auto majors Renault and Nissan have also announced a Rs 5,300 crore ($600 million) investment in Tamil Nadu as part of their new India strategy. (() While four of their vehicles will be brand new C-segment SUVs, there will be two A-segment cars — one each by Renault and Nissan.

Maruti Suzuki

Maruti Suzuki, which aims to regain its 50 percent marketshare by the middle of the decade, is expected to invest Rs 42,000 crore on two greenfield facilities in the country. It is still in the process of deploying Rs 18,000 crore (Rs 11,000 crore in the first phase) at its Kharkhoda facility in Haryana, and there is speculation that it will spend Rs 24,000 crore on another location. Both the facilities will have an annual capacity of 2 million units.

“Based on an estimation of the market growth till 2030-31, including growth of exports, we estimated that besides installing 1 million units in Kharkhoda we would need another 1million capacity. Actual investment sanctions would be made from time to time taking actual market growth into account,” RC Bhargava, Chairman, MSIL, told Moneycontrol. He stated that the company would be meeting its investment needs through internal accruals, and that it had cash reserves of Rs 45,000 crore as of March.

MG Motor India

MG Motor India also recently announced that it will invest over Rs 5,000 crore to beef up its manufacturing operations by 2028. The Chinese-owned British carmaker, revealing a five-year roadmap, said that it would be setting up a second manufacturing plant, which would have a dedicated battery assembly unit to bring down the cost of “electric vehicle manufacturing” and “mainstreaming EVs”.

In an official statement, the company revealed that it will also be spending part of the earmarked outlay for augmenting the installed capacity at its Halol unit from 1.2 lakh units to 3 lakh units per annum. The company intends to launch 4-5 cars, mostly electric vehicles, and achieve 65 to 75 percent of its sales through EV by 2028.

Mahindra & Mahindra

Late last year, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M Ltd) had announced that, through its subsidiary, it will make investments of around Rs 10,000 crore over 7-8 years to set up a manufacturing facility in Pune. In an official release, M&M revealed that the amount will be spent on development and production of its upcoming Born Electric Vehicles (BEVs). Based on the INGLO EV Platform, these include e-SUVs under the ‘XUV’ brand and the all-new electric-only brand, ‘BE’.

A report by Bain & Company claims that India’s electric vehicles (EV) value chain revenue pool is expected to reach between $76 billion and $100 billion by 2030, potentially translating to an $8 billion–$11 billion profit pool. The same report also indicated that 35-40% of all vehicles sold in India by 2030 will be EVs and that the electric car segment will account for 15-20% of total four-wheeled PV sales by the end of this decade."

The new electric vehicle (EV) businesses of Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) could be value accretive, brokerage firm Nomura said on March 23.

“MM’s core business is trading at ~1x FY23F EV/Sales. We estimate the ‘NewCo’ valuation could be ~2.5x FY23F EV/sales; hence, we think the fundraising should be value accretive,” the brokerage said in a report a day after M&M announced the incorporation of a new wholly owned subsidiary NewCo for last-mile mobility (LMM).

The auto major also announced the raising of around Rs 600 crore from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) for the business. After the infusion, IFC will own 9.97 percent to 13.64 percent stake in the subsidiary.

IFC’s financing would help scale up the business faster while enabling the launch of new-generation products, the brokerage firm said.

“The company’s last-mile mobility (LMM) business is well suited for electrification, due to: 1) its closed loop operation within a smaller radius; 2) lower load requirements; and 3) ability to reduce emissions in high-population-density areas. Hence, we believe it has the potential to see strong government support in the form of incentives or regulations,"" the analysts wrote.

""M&M has been focussing diligently on this segment for the past few years. In the past one year, it has seen traction with its e-3W business’ average monthly volumes rising from ~2k units in 4QFY22 to ~4.5k units in 4QFY23.”

The new businesses—EVCo and NewCo—have been valued between $5.8-9.8 billion said the analysts, versus the value of the company’s core business’s market-assigned value of $11 billion. These estimates value NewCo between $536 million and 734 million and EVCo between $5.25 billion and $9.09 billion.

EVCo was incorporated in July 2022 in collaboration with British International Invest (BII), a UK-based development finance institution. M&M’s four-wheeler EV segment was to be transferred to the new subsidiary and BII was to own between 2.75 percent and 4.76 percent.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

We met with the management of Mahindra & Mahindra (MM) to gauge the overall environment – both at macro and company levels. Management indicated that demand environment for the auto business has been stable in general but it expects slower growth for tractors in FY24 (even under normal monsoons) due to high base and three Navratras in FY23. While chip supply is improving, it is still not adequate enough to ramp-up production meaningfully. Chip supply is the only restricting factor to reach full capacity for production of SUVs. Profitability of both businesses should improve though ramp-up of new businesses (EVs and farm equipment) would dilute expansion. However, commodity cost inflation visible from the lows of 3QFY23 is the primary risk of MM’s business. We cut our FY24E EPS by 8% to factor in: a) lower tractor/SUV volumes, and b) the adverse impact of losses from new businesses. We reiterate our BUY rating as we still expect 20% EPS CAGR and 2pp RoCE improvement over FY23-25, along with attractive valuations.

Outlook

Hence, we maintain our BUY rating with a TP of INR1,525 (premised on Mar’25E SoTP or implied core P/E at TP, which stands at 15.7x FY25E EPS).

Domestic research and broking firm Motilal Oswal has maintained its 'buy' call on the stock and expects a compounded average growth rate of 20 percent in EPS and 2pp RoCE improvement over FY23-25, along with cheap valuations. It expects M&M to reach a target price of Rs 1,525 per share, an upside of 20 percent from current market price.

""We cut our FY24 EPS by 8 percent to factor in lower tractor and sports utility vehicle (SUV) volumes growth, and the adverse impact of losses from new businesses,"" it added.

SUV demand holding up well amid macro challenges

M&M does not see any sign of demand moderation for its SUVs. Its orderbook is steady despite an uncertain macro environment. But there are signs of sustained stress at the lower segment in rural markets, Motilal Oswal said.

Chip supply improving but still restricting full capacity ramp-up

According to the M&M management, the waiting period for the SUVs has come down by 1-1.5 months, largely benefitting from supply chain recovery. While supply chain issues are improving gradually, the situation is still volatile. The sole issue at this point remains the shortage of semiconductors, while the other supply chain issues have been resolved substantially since China is opening up.

Hence, M&M is not able to ramp up its SUV production to full capacity of around 39,000 units per month as against an average wholesale of 30-33,000 units.

Tractor growth to be low on high base, even in normal monsoon

The FY23 tractor demand benefitted largely from higher mandi prices of crops than MSPs and as FY23 had three Navratras, apart from other favorable agro-economic indicators. M&M is now focussed on building inventory before the festive season in March 2023. However, the FY24 tractor volume growth would be lower on a high base, even in case of a normal monsoon, as there would be only one Navratra in FY24, the report by Motilal Oswal said.

Margin expansions likely, but commodity price inflation a risk

M&M sees scope for margin expansion from the third-quarter levels in both auto and farm equipment sector (FES). The auto business has many levers for margin expansion in the form of price hikes, easing semiconductor premium as supplies improve, and cost-cutting measures, being offset by ramp-up in EVs.

For the FES segment, the tractor business margins are likely to improve but a sharp ramp-up in farm equipment will dilute the margin expansion. However, rising prices for commodities from the lows of Q3 FY23 could be one of the key risks for margin expansion, the brokerage firm noted.

Global research firm CLSA has upgraded Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) to 'buy' from 'outperform' and has also raised the target price.

The global research firm has raised the target price from Rs 1,583 to Rs 1,619 per share.

At 1:59pm, Mahindra and Mahindra traded at Rs 1,281.30, up Rs 11.50, or 0.91 percent, on the BSE. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 1,305.50 and an intraday low of Rs 1,278.05.

The research firm has cited strong momentum across the farm and auto business, with expectations for SUV volumes to expand more than 20 percent in FY24 due to a strong order backlog as the reasons for the upgrade.

Additionally, it has mentioned that M&M plans to launch six new electric SUVs over the next five years and increase capacity to 49,000 units per month to service rising demand.

CLSA anticipates tractor volumes to rise 13.6 percent on-year, driven by strong winter crop production and prices. Overall, CLSA's analysis suggests that M&M is poised for growth across multiple business segments, leading to their bullish outlook and upgraded rating.

Vehicle ownership levels in India to speed up

CLSA says that auto sales in India are expected to rise all the way to 2031, driven by an increase in per capita income that is set to outpace vehicle prices. It predicts that lower-income states will lead the way in vehicle ownership over the next decade, and that premium and clean-energy vehicles will see stronger growth than mass-market sales.

According to CLSA's analysis of India's vehicle registration data, cars and two-wheelers should see strong growth, achieving 9-11.5 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) in volume over the next decade.

Premium and cleaner-fuel vehicles to lead

CLSA's analysis suggests that upgrades to premium and electric vehicles are likely to drive higher auto sales in India. As per their report, rising income levels are expected to boost demand for premium motorcycles and SUVs, while consumer awareness, government support, and declining ownership costs will drive demand for cleaner-fuel vehicles.

In particular, CLSA expects electric vehicles to account for 25 percent of annual two-wheeler registrations by FY31, indicating significant growth potential in this segment. They also predict that cleaner-fuel passenger vehicles will jump from 18 percent of registrations to 40 percent by FY31, demonstrating the increasing popularity of environmentally friendly vehicles in India.

Auto stocks to rerate

According to CLSA, most auto companies in India are trading at or below their historical trading ranges. However, as volumes increase at a projected 9-11.5 percent CAGR over the next decade, CLSA expects valuations for these companies to rerate.

In particular, CLSA recommends buying stocks linked to premium categories such as Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors, M&M, and Tata Motors, as they expect valuations for these companies to expand at a higher rate compared to those linked to entry-level vehicles.

On the other hand, the global research firm has 'sell' calls on Maruti Suzuki and TVS Motor Company, suggesting that they may not be as well-positioned to benefit from the expected growth in the auto sector.

Tirth Pandya’s parents wanted to upgrade to a luxury car to celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. His father, who was deliberating multiple options, finally chose two SUVs recommended by Tirth: the GLE 400d (booked in May 2022) for his daily commute, and the Mercedes Benz G63 (booked in June 2022) for weekend getaways. Delivery of both models is expected only this year.

“Since those are CBUs (Completely Built up), allocations are lower for dealers and take time. But they (his parents) are ready to wait and don’t have a better alternative. I recommended they opt for SUVs that will be more comfortable than sedans,” said Pandya, a second-generation real estate and petrol pump entrepreneur in Ahmedabad.

Along similar lines, Abhinav Aggarwal, residing in Gurugram, had booked an XUV 700 in 2021. But he cancelled his booking after waiting for more than a year and eventually chose an SUV sold by other OEMs as they had a shorter waiting period.

“I was driving a sedan and was planning to buy a sedan but my folks and family members suggested I go for an SUV because that has a style statement,” said Aggarwal, who works in a government organization.

It is due to the buying pattern of customers such as Pandya, Ahuja, and Aggarwal that the demand for SUVs continues to skyrocket, leading to inordinate delays in post-purchase deliveries. Industry analysts reckon that while the auto sector’s chip shortage is gradually easing, leading to improved supply, one of the primary reasons for the long waiting periods is the limited production capacity of auto manufacturers.

For instance, Maruti Suzuki, which has a current booking backlog of around 4,00,000 vehicles (including 1,40,000 SUVs), churns out only 1.5 lakh cars every month. Similarly, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), which manufactures 40,000 utility vehicles every month, has a booking pipeline of 2.66+ lakh SUVs.

“The easy availability of finance and increase in disposable income is making customers upgrade from hatchbacks/sedans to SUVs. Production still remains a bottleneck to match the demand,” said Puneet Gupta, director, S&P Global Mobility.

Per data shared by JATO Dynamics, a data intelligence firm, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) has a waiting period of 18-36 Weeks for the Thar and 60-62 weeks for the XUV700. While the Tata Nexon has a waiting period of four to six weeks, one can expect delivery of the Hyundai Venue and Creta only after 12-20 weeks and 12-14, weeks respectively, according to JATO Dynamics (see table below).

Similarly, Hyundai Alzacar has a waitlist of eight to 12 weeks for the petrol variant and 20-24 weeks for the diesel variant. Car market leader Maruti Suzuki has a 40-42 week waiting period for the Ertiga, the JATO Dynamics data showed.

Maruti Suzuki has revealed that its recently unveiled Jimny, which has already garnered 20,000+ bookings, will have a waiting period of one year. There is also a 6-month waiting period for the Grand Vitara, which was launched last year.

Dissecting the PV market

While the Indian Passenger Vehicle (PV) market continues to witness positive growth in numbers post Covid, the Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) segment may turn out to be the biggest volume puller in 2023.

According to a research study carried out by JATO Dynamics, the contribution of SUVs may go up further, from 42 percent to 48.3 percent of the total passenger vehicle market. Of the 39,17,791 units of Passenger Vehicles expected to be sold, 18,92,364 will be SUVs, the data intelligence firm stated (see table below).

Last year, SUVs accounted for 38,20,578 units out of the 16,03,348 passenger vehicles sold in the country, said JATO Dynamics. The firm claimed that the contribution of hatchbacks will drop from 34.7 percent (13,26,324 units) to 30.6 percent (11,98,486 units) and MPVs from 12 percent (4,57,239 units) to 9 percent (3,52,455 units).

Carmakers upping the SUV ante

So far, SUVs have contributed 11.4 percent of Maruti Suzuki’s total sales during the ongoing financial year. In the next fiscal year, the company anticipates the volume share to be around 25 percent of its total sales, riding on the availability of new models such as the Fronx and Jimny and with full-year sales of the Vitara and Brezza (launched last year).

Shashank Srivastava, Senior Executive Officer, Sales & Marketing, Maruti Suzuki, stated, “The key drivers for robust SUV sales are the continued consumer preference for SUV design elements of high and upright driving position, larger ground clearance, flexible interior space management, along with the status attached with SUV ownership in India. Moreover, the price points of compact SUV segment vehicles overlap with premium hatchbacks and entry sedans, thus making overlapping possible across segments.

Similarly, Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) reported its best-ever annual sales in 2022, on the back of robust demand for its sports utility vehicles (SUVs), which contributed around 53 percent of its overall sales.

Talking to CNBC TV18 recently, Tarun Garg, the newly appointed Chief Operating Officer of Hyundai India, acknowledged that there has been a rise in consumer preference for the SUV segment with Hyundai as well as with the industry.

“As far as industry is concerned, SUVw contributed 42 percent to the overall industry in 2022, whereas for Hyundai the number was 53 percent. We believe that there is a lot more upside still to it and we at Hyundai probably are looking at somewhere between 55 to 60 percent of SUVs in the calendar year 2023. And I believe that even industry would somewhere be between 45-50 percent,” Garg told CNBC.

Mahindra and Mahindra, in a post-Q3 FY 23 earnings media interaction, revealed that SUVs such as the Scorpio-N, XUV700, and Thar have generated high volumes during the past few quarters and foresee a similar trend in the upcoming quarters. The company’s Year to Date (YTD) total volumes as on January 2022, in passenger vehicles, stood at 2,92,898 and SUV volumes stand at 2,90,764 units. The Mumbai-based automaker also claimed that it continues to maintain the leading position in SUV revenue market share with 20.6 percent in the third quarter.

“The increase in vehicle launches over the years has led to a wide variety of choices in cars for the Indian consumer. This, coupled with increased affordability due to rising disposable income, has taken the overall SUV market share to almost 50 percent in passenger vehicles,” Veejay Nakra, President, Automotive Division, M&M Ltd., told Moneycontrol. He added, “We also see that the urban Indian consumer is intending to live life to the fullest, going outdoors and aspiring to travel and explore, especially post-pandemic, thus opting for larger, more capable SUVs as their preferred vehicle of choice.”"

HDFC Securities' research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M Q3 adjusted PAT at INR 20bn came in above our estimate of INR 18.7bn, primarily due to higher-than-expected other income, even as its operational performance was in line with our estimates. M&M’s performance highlights for YTDFY23 are: (1) steady market share revival in the UV segment every quarter on the back of its new launches; (2) 90bps market share improvement in tractors to 41.4%, without compromising on margins; (3) revival in market share in <3.5T segment; (4) continued leadership in e-3Ws with 65% market share in Q3. Also, it is commendable that M&M has already achieved most of the targets it earmarked a couple of years back (including EPS CAGR, improvement in auto margins, RoE at 18%, calibrated asset allocation etc.) and management has indicated that it is now time to raise its targets from here on. We continue to remain positive on the business momentum given: (1) a strong order backlog for UVs; (2) positive rural sentiment that is likely to be boosted with some freebies from the government in an election year, which bodes well for tractors; (3) focused strides taken to achieve a strong position in EVs; (4) continuing focus on careful capital allocation.



Outlook

Due to better-than-expected volume recovery in tractors, we raise our EPS estimates by 1-4% over FY23-25E. Maintain BUY, with a revised TP of INR1,554/sh (earlier at INR1,528/share).

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M’s Q3FY23 revenue surged 41% YoY to Rs216.5bn, broadly in line with our estimates. EBITDA also grew strongly by 56% to Rs28.1bn, slightly below estimates owing to lower-than-expected gross profit. The PV order book is strong at 2,66,000+ units, driven by robust demand for Scorpio-N, XUV700, Thar, and XUV400 models. EVs remain a focus area, with deliveries of Electric XUV400 to commence this quarter. Five more electric PVs are expected be launched over FY25-27. Going forward, we build in revenue/earnings CAGR of 12%/13% over FY23-25E.



Outlook

We maintain BUY with a TP of Rs1,590 (Rs1,550 earlier), based on 12x its FY25E standalone core EPS (Dec-24E earlier) and value of subsidiaries/investments at Rs680/share.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

We trim our FY24/25E EBITDA margin estimate by 50/80bps, as we see increase in contribution from EVs and lower margin automotive segment. MM reported 3QFY23 EBI TDA margin at 13% (+110bps QoQ), slightly above our estimate of 12.7%, driven by operating leverage. MM has a healthy ~266k units automotive order book and aims to ramp up capacity. MM revised its FY23 growth guidance for tractor industry to 10%+ (vs high-single digit earlier). Furthermore, MM aims to grow its farm machinery revenue 10x by 2027. At the analyst meet, MM unveiled concept EV based on all new born electric platform, XUV EV and BE EV range and looked impressive (design wise). MM remains one of our preferred picks, given (1) growing preference for SUV, (2) capacity ramp-up to fulfill strong order book, (3) leadership position in tractor industry, and (4) increased focus on EV space across segments (e3W, ePV, etc).

Outlook

We believe that RM tailwinds, operating leverage and end of volume of introductory priced model would benefit margins (we build-in c200bps increase over FY23-25E). Retain ‘BUY’ with unchanged TP of Rs 1,560 (18x on Dec-24E core EPS and Rs 307 for subs) as we also roll forward by one quarter.

Mahindra & Mahindra - 14 -02 - 2023 - prabhu"
"February 14, 2023 02:25 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/mahindra-rules-out-introducing-electric-version-of-kuv100-10071481.html,"(PC-Shifting gears)

Mahindra & Mahindra, the automobile manufacturer that has lined up eight electric cars by 2027, will not introduce an electric version of the KUV100, a top executive said.

“It is unlikely that we will launch any electric SUV under Rs 10 lakh. So eKUV100 is ruled out,” Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director – auto and farm sectors at Mahindra Group, told reporters at an earnings press conference. He didn’t cite any reasons.

However, analysts reckoned the Mumbai-based automaker aims to cater to individual buyers who are looking for aspirational cars rather than fleet operators who want to buy sub-Rs 10 lakh vehicles.

There had been speculation that the electric variant of the KUV100, once the compact SUV is launched, would take on Tata Motors’ yet-to-be-introduced Punch EV, priced in the range of Rs. 8.25-10 lakh.

M&M said February 10 that its standalone net profit rose 13.5 percent to Rs 1,528 crore and revenue climbed 41 percent to Rs 21,654 crore during the third quarter of FY23, aided by strong auto sales.

A pre-production version of the e-KUV100, which was unveiled at Auto Expo’20, was initially scheduled for a Q1 FY20 rollout. The launch was reportedly postponed many times due to Covid, battery sourcing and other issues. M&M has officially not shared a reason for the delay in the rollout.

Value proposition

“In phase one, considering the taxation structure, OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) are offering EVs in compact and midsize segments so that they can offer a value proposition to the consumer. Also, this category of consumer is highly aspirational and wants to experiment and may also have dedicated parking space,” said Puneet Gupta, Auto Analyst from S&P Automotive. “In phase two, mini e-cars will make sense when battery prices come down and localisation takes off under PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme.”

M&M currently sells the XUV400, its first all-electric SUV that was launched in January at an introductory price of Rs 16.99 lakh to Rs 18.99 lakh (both prices ex-showroom) for the first 5,000 bookings. It received bookings for 10,000 units in the first four days and 15,000 as of February 10.

M&M has unveiled five electric SUVs, which will be categorised under two brands – XUV and BE (Born Electric). Of the five unveiled models named XUV.e8, XUV.e9, BE.05, BE.07 and BE.09, the first four will be made available in the domestic market from 2024 to 2026.

A quarter of the company’s SUV portfolio will be electric vehicles by 2027.

“As I mentioned earlier, 20-30 percent of our SUV sales by 2027 would be electric. So that translates to… 15,000-20,000 (units) a month or around 200,000 a year approximately. Our capacities planned would be much higher than the total numbers that we are targeting,” Jejurikar said.

M&M said it would invest Rs 10,000 crore over seven to eight years to set up a manufacturing facility in Pune and towards development and production of its BE vehicles. The investment has been approved under the Maharashtra government’s industrial promotion scheme for electric vehicles.

The M&M stock price traded at Rs 1,367 on the NSE at 02:25PM, up by Rs 13.55 from a day earlier."

The company, on February 10 reported a 13.5 percent jump in its standalone net profit at Rs 1,528 crore during the third quarter of FY 2023, up from Rs 1,335 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal.

The company's revenue from operations was up 41 percent at Rs 21,654 crore from Rs 15,349 crore during the quarter ended December.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were up 56 percent at Rs 2,814 crore from Rs 1,803 crore and the margin was up at 13 percent.

Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company after December quarter earnings:

Morgan Stanley

The research firm has kept 'overweight' rating on the stock amid strong execution and EV focus. The target is at Rs 1,472 per share.

The company delivered well on market share, ROE expansion and shareholder value creation. There are no near-term catalysts, reported CNBC-TV18.

Nomura

The brokerage house has maintained 'buy' call on the stock with a target price at Rs 1,718 per share.

The third quarter was in-line, consistently delivers EPS growth and RoE targets. Future EVs are very promising with SUVs & farm implements to be high growth segments.

The EVs are very impressive with attractive designs and next generation of tech. Positive on farm implements and investments in ‘growth gems’, reported CNBC-TV18.

JPMorgan

The broking firm has kept the 'overweight' rating on the stock with a target at Rs 1,520 per share.

The Q3 results were broadly in-line with estimates. The headline EBITDA beat driven by other segments, while auto+Farm EBIT was in-line. The auto segment margin surprised positively, driven by operations leverage and better ASPS.

The farm EBIT margin improvement is slower-than-expected but better than peer Escorts.

The management highlighted further upside from its growth gems in coming quarters, reported CNBC-TV18.

Goldman Sachs

The research house has maintained the 'buy' call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,600 per share. The company has reported an in-line Q3.

Expect operation leverage and price hikes on high ASP products to support margin trajectory. There could be some offsets from higher EV sales and farm implement sales.

The management expects supply of Scorpio-N aggregate components to improve starting end February.

The company sees next set of growth opportunities in electric three-wheelers, farm implements and better management of captive financing and it services verticals, reported CNBC-TV18.

CLSA

The brokerage firm has downgraded the stock to 'outperform' from 'buy' as the company has seen a sharp run-up YTD. The target kept at Rs 1,583 per share.

The Q3 was marginally below expectations due to lower than expected tractor EBIT margin. The automotive business continued to perform well. The SUV order book increased marginally to 2.66 lakh units.

The market recouped more than half of its previous week's losses and climbed 250 points or 1.4 percent on the Nifty50 during the week ended February 3. The recovery is largely attributed to the short covering-led buying in beaten-down banking and financial services and select Adani Group stocks along with fall in oil prices.

The Nifty50 finally settled above the 17,800 mark, the lower band of previous trading range (17,800-18,250) seen before the recent correction, after taking strong support at 200 DMA (around 17,300).

In the near term, the index is expected to take support at 17,600, which has been holding quite well on every closing in the past six consecutive sessions, with resistance at the 18,000-18,250 zone but, considering the recent news-led activity, further volatility can't be ruled out, experts said.

""Although we managed to recover the lost ground this week, we are not completely out of the woods yet. A continuous news flow with respect to the Adani group is likely to give volatile swings on both sides,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

As far as the levels are concerned, he feels, the immediate support is visible around 17,600; but the major sacrosanct zone remains at 17,400 – 17,300, which coincides with the 200-day SMA. ""Ideally, till the time we defend this, there is no real reason to worry for,"" Chavan said.

On the flipside, if the market has to regain its pride, the Nifty needs to surpass 18,000 – 18,100 on a closing basis, which will confirm the completion of the recent corrective phase and market can then resume the higher degree uptrend, the expert said.

He advised that the banking space needs to be watched closely because it is likely to act as a catalyst for setting the near-term direction for the market. Apart from this, a lot of thematic moves started playing out well towards the end of the week. One must keep focusing on such potential trading opportunities, he said.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the February 3 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Bajaj Finserv: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,337 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 | Target: Rs 1,500 | Return: 12 percent

The stock spent a lot of time between the Rs 1,800 and Rs 1,600 levels during September and November 2022. However, since the stock has broken the trading range at Rs 1,600, we saw a significant fall in the stock towards Rs 1,246 level without any meaningful pullback. The pullback has sent the stock into the highly oversold zone.

Technically, such a pattern could result in a move back to retrace the sell-off. Based on it, the positional traders should be buyers at the current levels with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,240. On the upside, it will find resistance at Rs 1,450 or Rs 1,500.

ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 381 | Stop-Loss: Rs 350 | Target: Rs 440 | Return: 15 percent

Technically, it has the potential to move to the next extension levels, which are Rs 400 and Rs 440. On the flip side, Rs 370 and Rs 360 should be support areas for the stock to accumulate. From a medium-term perspective, buy ITC with a stop-loss at Rs 350.

Mahindra Lifespace Developers: Buy | LTP: Rs 380 | Stop-Loss: Rs 340 | Target: Rs 460 | Return: 21 percent

From September 2022, the stock was in a vertical fall from highs of Rs 550, it fell to Rs 350 levels. However, after hitting Rs 350 levels, the stock saw a lot of volume-based activity between Rs 340 and Rs 380 levels.

Technically, the stock has fallen towards the key support area and based on the price and volume expansion, our strategy should be to buy from a medium to long-term perspective. Keep the final stop-loss at Rs 340 for all trading positions. On the upside, we can see Rs 420 or Rs 460 levels.

In the week gone by, the Adani group fiasco hit the market like an asteroid. The spillover of the carnage triggered a massive selloff in the banking space that soon spread to the broader market. Fortunately, things cooled off towards the end of the week, with the Nifty recovering smartly to reclaim the 17,800 mark on a closing basis.

Though the index we managed to recover the lost ground, we are still not out of the woods completely. A continuous news flow about the Adani group is likely to lead to volatile swings on both sides.

For the Nifty, the immediate support is at 17,600 but 17,400–17,300 remains the sacrosanct level, coinciding with the 200-day SMA (17,297). As long as the Nifty defends the level, there is no reason to worry.

For a consistent up move, the Nifty needs to surpass 18,000– 18,100 on a closing basis, which would confirm the completion of the recent corrective phase.

Traders are advised to keep a tab on the above-mentioned scenarios as well as global and domestic events.

Here are two buy calls for the short term:

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,388 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,348 | Target: Rs 1,460 | Return: 5 percent

The automobile space has bucked the trend in the past couple of weeks. This stock didn't participate in the broader market destruction and when things calmed down, it started moving in the upward direction.

Stock prices clocked fresh record highs and confirmed a weekly close around them, indicating strength in the counter.

On the weekly time-frame chart, we can see a positive crossover in ‘RSI-Smoothened’ oscillator. We recommend buying this stock for a trading target of Rs 1,460. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 1,348.

Ashok Leyland: Buy | LTP: Rs 153.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 149 | Target: Rs 162 | Return: 5 percent

We will stick to the outperforming pocket and this stock has been resilient in recent weeks. The price has stayed 200-day SMA (Rs 145) for the last three months and developed a good accumulation price pattern.

On February 3, we witnessed a breakout above recent hurdles on the closing basis and considering the decent volume activity, we expect the stock to continue its northward trajectory.

Traders can look to buy for a near-term target of Rs 162. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 149.

The Nifty50 on February 1 clocked healthy rally and moved closer to psychological 18,000 mark after the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman delivered good budget with announcement of increase in capital expenditure by 33 percent to Rs 10 lakh crore for FY24 and tax benefits to rural economy & taxpayers, with unchanged capital gains tax, but the selling in Adani Group, life insurance and bank stocks in last couple of hours of trade wiped out all those gains of more than 300 points.

The index has formed bearish candle with long upper and lower shadow on the daily charts, which resembles High Wave kind of pattern formation, indicating the indecisiveness among buyers and sellers about further market trend.

But the Nifty50 strongly defended 200 DEMA (daily exponential moving average - 17,550) for fourth day in a row. Also it has taken a strong support at 200 DMA (daily moving average - 17,300). Further it has still respected long upward sloping support trendline adjoining lows of March 2020 and June 2022, while on the weekly scale, it has so far defended 50 WEMA (weekly exponential moving average - 17,400).

Overall it was a volatile session for the market and the index has been rangebound. Unless and until above support levels get decisively broken, there is no cause of worry, but volatility is likely to continue with resistance at 17,800-18,000 area, experts said.

""The pivotal zone of 17,500 was firmly safeguarded, which implies the significance of the support, followed by the sacrosanct support of 200 SMA which is placed around 17,300. On the higher end, 17,800 is likely to act as a stiff resistance, followed by the crucial hurdle of the 18,000 mark,"" Osho Krishan, Sr. Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One said.

Going forward, he feels the market is likely to remain volatile ahead of the aftermaths of the Budget. Meanwhile, traders should keep a close tab on the mentioned levels and avoid aggressive bets till the trend gets clear, he advised.

Here are top 10 stock ideas after the Union Budget. Returns are based on the February 1 closing prices:

Bandhan Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 237 | Stop-Loss: Rs 252 | Target: Rs 210 | Return: 11 percent

The banking index is also witnessing a roller coaster ride in line with the benchmark index and a few stocks like Bandhan Bank have been consistently underperforming the pack.

Sharekhan's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M priced its first e SUV, XUV 400 competitively – well under Rs 20 lakh bracket, which in our view would help it to garner healthy bookings in line with XUV’s brand equity. Implementation of BS-VI phase-2 is likely to have a minimal impact on cost inflation, helping M&M to maintain its growth trajectory. We believe M&M is on track with its growth roadmap, across its core segments, viz. farm equipment, ICE passenger car segments, passenger EVs, and LCV business.

Outlook

We retain our Buy rating on M&M with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,550, led by increasing focus on new launches and growing brand value of its core SUV products. The stock trades at a P/E multiple of 18.3x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.6x its FY2024E estimates.

Mahindra & Mahindra - 19 -01-2023 - khan"
"January 27, 2023 04:13 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/auto/up-to-30-of-mahindra-mahindra-vehicles-will-be-electric-by-2027-says-rajesh-jejurikar-9881121.html,"Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M), which has a backlog of orders for Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)-vehicles such as the XUV700, Scorpio-N and Thar, has just introduced an electric Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV). Rajesh Jejurikar, the company’s Executive Director (Auto & Farm Sector), said in an interview with Moneycontrol on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) meetings in Davos that the company wants to maximise its presence in India’s electric passenger vehicle market.

“…we hope that 20 to 30 percent of our portfolio in 2027 will be electric,” he said. He also said that while the government is doing enough to kick-start the economy, some measures to drive consumption in the rural parts of India would be desirable. Edited excerpts:

What's top of mind for Indian CEOs at Davos at a time when their global counterparts are worried about multiple crises converging?

You know, I think at least from our standpoint, we see this as an opportunity to take a global leadership. For us, Davos enables us to collect connect with so many tech leaders, people who bring in new thinking. So we're really here to think of what we need to do to drive growth. (This is) because India is still a strong growth story.

2022 was a banner year for you in terms of how you performed on the auto side, tractor side. What can we expect in 2023? Can we hope for a repeat of 2022? There is an air of caution as people are cutting down on marketing spends, at least if I look at the new economy businesses. But tell us about what you're seeing on the ground.

We're not in a mindset of cutting back on marketing or anything at this stage. We have had some really good launches. We have the (XUV) 400 launch, which is the electric (SUV). We just announced the prices today (January 16). So we are actually launching the (XUV) 400. We will start (taking) orders on January 26, and start deliveries by March. And we have a 34.4 kilowatt hour version of that which is going to be priced at Rs. 15.99 lakh. And for the first 5,000 bookings and deliveries for that will start in the festive season and then a 40 kilowatt hour one, which will start deliveries in March. That's priced at Rs. 18.9 lakh. So they're both very good prices, and hopefully will excite the market. So that's new for us.

But we have a lot to build on out of our current successful launches, which is Thar. We just launched the rear wheel drive (variant), which got a very good response, (so was the) XUV700, Scorpio (N) .I think the entire portfolio is doing well. I won't look at percentage repeat, because that was on a low base and all the new products came in. But we are optimistic about a strong momentum for our SUV business.

Our tractors (business) have seen a good year (which was) better than what we thought. And we'll wait and watch on what the outlook for tractor demand is normally…still early to call out. We wait for some other indicators like monsoons and government spending indications and so on before really forming a view on next year's growth.

What's your visibility as far as rural demand is concerned? Because if you look at the RBI, they've taken a series of steps, which was expected to ease inflation in the first half of 2023. So can you give us a sense of how you see rural demand shaping up this year?

Inflation, especially in the FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) kind of industries, has impacted rural demand. It hasn't so much in the tractor side where we've seen double-digit growth. We'll have to wait and watch on what happens on the lower end of consumption, which is the daily consumption growth, which impacts FMCG. On the tractor side, a lot will depend on what's happening to the monsoon and so on. So we'll wait and watch a little bit for rural demand. I guess it's too early to call.

You mentioned the new launch today. So tell us about your own plans as far as the EV space is concerned, how do you see it panning out? What kind of a role do you expect M&M to play in this segment? Because there is clearly a lot of excitement about moving away from Internal Combustion to Electric Vehicles. What kind of role can M&M play?

So two key segments we are playing in at the moment --one is the electric three-wheelers, where are we seeing very good penetration compared to the ICE three wheelers, and that's crossed 10 percent. We have a strong presence there -- we have a 60 percent market share with our products. On the SUV side, the penetration of electric is very low. It's in the region of 1 to 2 percent in the B and C segments. And we are launching new products. One which I just told you about and then the Born Electric portfolio, which will come towards the end of 2024 and getting into 2025. So three to five products and we hope that 20 to 30 percent of our portfolio in 2027 will be electric.

What can we look forward to from M&M in 2023 when it comes to launches, investments, capex and so on?

Capex we've already spoken about. So no immediate change right now. And a lot of it is going towards creating our electric portfolio. So no change. We've announced the creation of a new electric SUV company where BII (please expand) is the first investor that got valued at $9 billion, with the initial $250 million coming from BII. So that's one of the key areas. And we are really optimistic about creating a strong electric portfolio.

We just have two weeks to go for the budget. Your one big wishlist or one big reform that you would like to see in the last budget before the election.

We are really not focusing on subsidies and incentives at this point of time. I think creating positive sentiment and the economy driving consumption--that should be the key priority. And I think the government is on track to do that.

And as you said, if we manage to keep rural spends going?

The important thing on the budget is driving consumption. And, you know, the economy gets back into consumption, or high consumption mode. It's been good in the last two, three years… if that momentum sustains, then India will continue as a strong growth story."
"February 02, 2023 06:35 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/automobile/with-3000-bookings-in-2-days-maruti-suzuki-jimny-already-commands-a-3-month-waitlist-9864551.html,"Maruti Suzuki Jimny

Within a week of unveiling the Jimny at the Auto Expo, Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL) has bagged bookings for 8,000 units of the lifestyle sports utility vehicle (SUV), an official said. Anticipating robust orders for Jimny in the coming days, a senior company official claimed that the waiting period for this model has already gone up to three months.

Shashank Srivastava, Executive Director - Sales and Marketing, MSIL, had earlier told Moneycontrol, “Since Jimny is a global cult brand, there was already a section of buyers, who were eagerly waiting to buy it. Till today (14th January) morning, we have garnered 2,500 bookings, and by the end of the day we are confident of having 3,000 confirmed bookings.”

It is to be mentioned that bookings of the five-door Jimny, which will be available in a 1.5 litre petrol option, commenced on the day it was unveiled at the Expo.

Maruti Suzuki on 18th January, revealed that the segment wise break up of Jimny is: MT 50% ( Zeta 15 % Alpha 35% )and AT 50% ( Zeta 8% Alpha 42 %).

The Jimny, the entry of which in India had been speculated for more than three years, will be rolled out from MSIL’s Gurugram facility. It will take on the Mahindra Thar (priced in the range of Rs 9.99 lakh - Rs 16.99 lakh, ex-showroom and offered in a three-door variant only), which also saw a 4X2 variant getting added recently.

While Maruti Suzuki did not share Jimny’s price points and monthly production plans, it confirmed that it will be initially sold in a 4WD version, and there would not be a diesel option. Also, the three-door variant, which is being exported to many countries from India, will not be marketed here.

There is speculation that Maruti Jimny may be priced in the range of Rs 10-12.5 lakh, which the company didn’t comment on.

“The pricing and monthly output are very difficult (numbers) to discern at this moment. The introductory price will depend on multiple factors on what the competitor’s (Mahindra Thar) price range is, as well as input costs and total cost of production during those times,” added Srivastava.

“While the waitlist for this model has already gone up to two-three months, I won’t be surprised if we manage to book 10,000 units in a month or so, and customers get to wait for six months,” stated by Srivastava earlier.

It is to be mentioned that MSIL is currently grappling with a pending order book of 366,000 units, of which Ertiga constitutes 91,000 units (31 weeks wait time), Brezza 71,000 units (23-24 weeks wait time) and Grand Vitara 57,000 units (12-16 weeks wait time).

Meanwhile, MSIL has garnered 750 units of the newly-unveiled Fronx (a crossover version of the Baleno hatchback) until the 14th morning. Just like the Jimny, Fronx will be retailed at the company’s 260 (and counting) Nexa showrooms across the country. With the introduction of these two models, the car market leader in India hopes that the proportion of SUV sales from its existing line-up, which currently stands at 13.9 percent, will rise substantially by the end of this year.

As Srivastava observed, “Entry-level SUVs, which saw 665,000 units in sales last year, accounted for 21.7 percent of the PV (passenger vehicle) market and is the largest segment in the industry. Whenever the industry is growing you see a ‘sub-segment’ emerging, and we are seeing two emerging sub-segments, which is not catered to by the industry. While one is the young, urban, tech-savvy consumer who is looking for the Fronx, the second category is the lifestyle SUV off-roading which is growing. With the introduction of Jimny, this segment will grow quite a lot. As a result, our market share in the SUV space will also grow.”"

Here's what Vidnyan Sawant of GEPL Capital recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Godfrey Phillips India

Godfrey Phillips has been experiencing an uptrend, with successive peaks and troughs being consistently higher than those seen in the past.

The stock price has recently surged above neckline of the Inverse Head & Shoulder pattern, which is often seen as a bullish sign and may suggest that the stock is set to enter an uptrend.

The stock's price has consistently remained above two key moving averages, the 13-day and 26-day exponential moving averages, which have provided strong support for the stock's price.

While the momentum indicator MACD (moving average convergence divergence - 13, 26, 9) has shown a positive crossover above zero line reflecting the tendency of the prices to trend.

We recommend traders and investors to buy this stock for the target of Rs 2,480 for stop-loss of Rs 1,960 strictly on the closing basis.

Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M's stock price is currently near its all-time high, indicating that it has been experiencing strong upward momentum. The stock in the latest trading session has given a breakout from the Descending Triangle pattern, which may indicate that the stock's prior uptrend is set to continue.

The Bollinger bands, which are a measure of volatility on the daily time frame, have recently begun to widen, possibly signaling increased price movement and an upward trend.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily time frame has also recently broken above a key level, suggesting increasing momentum and potential upward movement in the stock's price.

We recommend traders and investors to buy this stock for a target of Rs 1,430 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,237 strictly on the closing basis.

CG Power and Industrial Solutions

CG Power and Industrial Solutions has been in an upward trend, with the stock's price consistently finding support at its bullish trend line since July 2022.

The stock prices have shown a change in its polarity around the level of Rs 260, pointing towards the rising bullish sentiment.

The stock's price has remained consistently above two key moving averages, the 18-day and 36-day exponential moving averages, and a technical indicator known as the super trend (7, 2) has recently turned positive, possibly signaling increased volatility and an upward trend.

Mahindra and Mahindra, one of India's oldest automakers, aims to sell its new family of electric SUVs around the globe, but an entry into the U.S. market won't happen until later in the decade, the chief executive told Reuters.

""I don't see us launching in the U.S. in the next five years,"" Anish Shah, Mahindra's CEO and managing director, said Tuesday in an interview.

A U.S. market entry ""could likely be longer than five years because we have to win in some of our key markets first,"" including Europe, he added.

Shah said Mahindra, as part of its long-range strategy, is considering whether to build vehicles in North America, to take advantage of incentives built into the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act.

""We will have to think about manufacturing closer to some of the major markets that is something we will look at,"" Shah said. ""But this is still far off.""

The company on Wednesday announced plans to build a $1.2 billion EV plant in Pune, near its Mumbai headquarters.

""We are in the process of doubling our capacity"" in part to fulfill demand in the Indian market, Shah said. Much of the new capacity is earmarked for electric vehicles, he said.

Mahindra in August unveiled a portfolio of five future electric SUVs, the first of which is slated to go into production in January. All five vehicles will be built on a common architecture that borrows heavily from partner Volkswagen's MEB electric vehicle platform.

Shah said Mahindra's partnership with VW may take on other forms as it goes forward, without elaborating.

Mahindra sells tractors and small off-road vehicles in the United States. A 2010 plan to import the company's diesel-powered Scorpio compact pickups was scuttled before launch."

A substantial 230 Nm of low-end torque is produced at only 1000 rpm. (Image: Auto Mahindra)

Mahindra & Mahindra on Thursday reported a 56 per cent rise in domestic passenger vehicles sales at 30,392 units in November 2022.

The company had sold 19,458 units in the same month last year, M&M said in a regulatory filing.

Utility vehicle sales were at 30,238 units as against 19,384 units in the year-ago month, up 56 per cent. Sales of cars and vans were higher at 154 units as compared to 74 units in the same month last year.

M&M President, Automotive Division Veejay Nakra said the growth in November sales was on the back of robust demand across the company's product portfolio.

""The supply chain situation continues to be dynamic due to continuing international disruptions. We are keeping a close watch and are taking appropriate steps,"" he added.

M&M said its total commercial vehicle sales were at 19,591 units last month.

Total tractor sales grew 10 per cent at 30,528 units as against 27,681 units in the year-ago month, the company added.

Domestic tractor sales were at 29,180 units as compared to 26,094 units in November last year, a growth of 12 per cent.

""Demand continued to remain strong in the post festival period on account of brisk sowing of rabi crops, fuelled by high moisture content in the soil and healthy reservoir levels and is expected to beat last year's record sowing of 70 million hectares,"" M&M President – Farm Equipment Sector, Hemant Sikka said.

On the outlook, he said, ""Procurement of Kharif crop has progressed well, bringing liquidity in the hands of farmers and this augurs very well for tractor industry's growth."" However, exports were down 15 per cent at 1,348 units as against 1,587 units in the same month last year."

Sharekhan's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M continued to deliver strong numbers in Q2FY2023, with EBITDA exceeding expectations by 6.5%. We firmly believe that M&M is on track with its growth roadmap. The company is taking a leap towards creating a strong product portfolio for passenger electric vehicles (EVs), besides its aggressive plans for farm equipment and ICE passenger car segments. EVs would be the next growth driver, driven by investments in product development, new launches, and focus on technical partnerships.

Outlook

We retain our Buy rating on M&M with an unchanged PT of Rs. 1,550, led by increasing focus on new launches and rising brand value of its core SUV products. The stock trades at a P/E multiple of 17.8x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.4x its FY2024E estimates.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M’s 2QFY23 revenue at Rs 208bn (+6% QoQ) came slightly above our estimate of Rs 206bn, led by higher-than-expected ASPs (at Rs 762k, +6% QoQ). However, EBITDA margin at 12% came slightly below our estimate of 12.3%, +10bps QoQ. Management highlighted that though commodity costs have softened, semiconductor shortage has allowed the company to reap full benefits. With successful SUV launches and strong order book of 260k+ units, management has announced capacity expansion plans for SUV business from 29k units/month in FY22 end to 39k/49k units/month in FY23/FY24. Its domestic UV share has improved by 200bps since FY22 to 17%. M&M is one of our preferred picks in the auto space, given (1) growing customer preference for SUV and back-to-back successful launches, (2) its leadership position in tractor industry, (3) proactiveness to leverage the EV trend, that can lead to value unlocking and, (4) well-played out capital allocation strategy. Also, RM tailwinds would further benefit margins (we builin 300bps expansion over FY22-25E). Our estimates remain largely unchanged.

Outlook

Retain ‘BUY’ with unchanged TP of Rs 1,500 (18x on Sep-24E core EPS and Rs 288 for subsidiaries).

"November 16, 2022 09:21 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/traditional-carmakers-rev-up-combustion-engine-capex-plans-even-as-ev-revolution-unfurls-around-them-9519201.html,"Representative image

Electric vehicles (EVs) may be the future of transport, but car manufacturers in India are rooted in the present. Despite nudges from the government for increased adoption of EVs, carmakers such as Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, and Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) are not shying away from building additional capacities for internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) to meet unmet demand. As per the guidance shared by the chief financial officers (CFOs) of all the companies above, a combined Rs 20,000 crore will be spent for the next few fiscals on ramping up output of waitlisted models.

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), which remains upbeat on its diesel powertrains, has said that it is ramping up total SUV capacity to nearly 6 lakh units a year in the next 12-15 months. The country’s leading SUV maker, which had a monthly output of 29,000 units per month until the last financial year, is currently seeing waiting periods of its bestselling models like the XUV700 stretching up to 22 months. M&M had announced an investment of Rs 7,900 crore over three years ending FY24 to ramp up production.

“The capacity will increase from 29,000 units per month to 39,000 units per month by the end of this fiscal. It would further be enhanced to 49,000 units a month by the end of next fiscal,” M&M executive director Rajesh Jejurikar told reporters at a virtual press conference after releasing quarterly numbers. He added, “The revised capacity will prepare the company for ‘export upsides’ and clear existing bookings of about 2.6 lakh units with a waiting period of 18-22 months on some of the models.”

Tata Motors has revealed that it will be spending Rs 6,000 crore for its standalone business, which includes both passenger and commercial vehicles. Group CFO Pathamadai Balachandran Balaji said the company, which currently produces 50,000 units a month, will be able to debottleneck its existing car plant capacities to produce around 55,000 units a month or 6.5 lakh units per annum. Once its Sanand plant (acquired from Ford) goes on stream, the Mumbai-based automaker will be able to generate an additional 25,000-30,000 units of capacity per month, taking its cumulative manufacturing capacity to over 9 lakh units a year.

“We are already seeing a surge in demand for the last one and a half years in the PV business and have already stepped up our capex last time and have signalled that. On top of that, we have the Ford plant (which we have acquired) which will be outside this and will conclude in Q3/Q4 of this financial year. That will be an added capex spend for this financial year. So a fair amount of investments are going in and we are well covered on the demand side to cater to the surging demand, particularly in the PV business,” Balaji said on a post-results conference call.

Tata Motors is also on course to invest 2.5 billion pounds (over Rs 23,500 crore) for its British subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover in the current fiscal to cater to higher demand for Range Rover Sport and Defender SUVs.

Market leader Maruti Suzuki India has also said that it plans to invest over Rs 7,000 crore this year on various initiatives, including the construction of a new plant in Haryana and new model launches. This is 40 percent higher than it had initially earmarked for this financial year. The company has already commenced work at the new facility in Sonipat district.

Maruti Suzuki CFO Ajay Seth said the amount set aside would cover various activities: “We’ll have to place orders to various vendors. So that will be one major portion of capex. Besides that, all the new model launches that we are doing where we have to have the investment on toolings, et cetera. I think that will be another large piece of capex. These are two areas where the capex will be maximum. Then you have the other routine capital expenditure on the other aspects of the business, which is R&D, the regular maintenance capex. So, these are the key areas where we will be spending.”

Carmakers’ plans to expand production of ICEVs come even as the government is advocating EVs, with an aim to have EV sales penetration of 30 percent for private cars (revised from 100 percent earlier), 70 percent for commercial vehicles, 40 percent for buses and 80 percent for two- and three-wheelers by 2030.

Auto analysts say that EV adoption will take time, given the lack of adequate supporting infrastructure such as charging stations along highways. “Since car manufacturers need to cater to customers’ needs today, continuous capex is required to make new ICE models meeting the latest regulations,” said Puneet Gupta, director, S&P Automotive, adding, “In India, car penetration levels are still low and since the economy is growing at a brisk pace, mobility needs will rise and the need for cars will grow. Since EV will only be 25 percent of the market by 2030, ICE investments will still be meaningful.”"

"November 11, 2022 08:34 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mm-unlikely-to-ditch-diesel-despite-ev-drive-9498601.html,"Contrary to the long-term strategies chalked out by global brands like Porsche, Toyota, Volvo, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Audi, Skoda, Volkswagen, etc., which have either ditched diesel entirely or intend to move away from it over the next couple of years, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) has categorically stated that it will not be walking away from ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles.

In fact, the country’s largest manufacturer of utility vehicles will be upping its monthly output of ICE SUVs (excluding pick-up trucks) from 29,000 units to 39,000 units by FY23-end, and 49,000 by end-FY24. This is over and above the capacities it has planned for its Born Electric (BE) range of zero emission vehicles, which will be rolled out in the next couple of years.

Some of M&M’s most popular diesel vehicles are the Bolero Neo, the Bolero, the Scorpio Classic, Mahindra Thar, and the XUV700. The company is scaling up capacity to reduce the extended waitlists for some of these models. For instance, the number of XUV700s produced per month will go up from 6,000 to 7,000. The number of Scorpio-Ns produced will go from 6,000 to 10,000 per month.

“We will continue to produce diesel engines in the BS6 (stage 1 and 2) avatars. These are extremely fuel efficient and actually help (the company meet) the CAFÉ norms. Diesel engines are our strength, hence we will continue with them. Many of the companies which have exited diesel didn’t really have much (sales) volume,” Rajesh Jejurikar, Executive Director (Auto & Farm Sectors), M&M, told reporters after announcing the second quarter FY23 results.

The Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) norms are a set of government regulations aimed at reducing fuel consumption and lowering carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. These are applicable to petrol, diesel, LPG, and CNG-powered vehicles.

M&M, which recorded its highest quarterly revenue for auto and farm segments during Q2FY23, claims to have the maximum revenue market share (RMS) in the SUV segment. Its sales volume during the quarter went up by 75 percent over last year —from 99,334 units to 1,74,098 units.

Sharing the capex outlined for three financial years ending FY24, Jejurikar said that M&M will be investing Rs 15,300 crore, a lion’s share of which (Rs 7,900 crore) will be deployed towards building capacity for ICE vehicles, followed by Rs 4,000 crore for electric vehicles (EV), and Rs 3,300 crore for the farm segment.

M&M expects petrol and diesel vehicles to comprise a substantial chunk of its portfolio over the next few years. “Looking at the nature of the country, until 2030, a large portion of our portfolio will still be ICE, and our sense is that if you look at the industry as a whole, ICE would comprise 60-70 percent of volumes,” added Jejurikar.

Jejurikar said that by 2027, it expected EVs to comprise between 20-30 percent of its total sales. By then, it expects to sell 12,000-17,000 units of its BE range of electric SUVs per month.

Asked about the penetration of EVs in the future, Jejurikar explained: “It is a combination of regulation and demand. For every automaker, the challenge is to understand and straddle both the options. Demand cannot grow in a significant way unless charging infrastructure builds up at scale. In a country like ours, that means deep penetration into rural markets.”

At Rs 2,090 crore, M&M has posted a 46 percent jump in its net profit in Q2 FY23, as against Rs 1,433 crore a year ago. The company's revenue was up 57 percent at Rs 20,839 crore, versus Rs 13,314 crore in the year-ago period.

Mahindra and Mahindra’s standalone revenue is expected to rise substantially year-on-year (YoY) in the quarter ended September 2022. But the Street has widely varying estimates for the standalone net profit growth over the same period last year.

While its standalone revenue has been forecast to rise between 55 percent and 58 percent on-year to Rs 20,650 crore to Rs 21,016 crore, its standalone net profit may increase 2.5-3.8 percent to touch Rs 1,728.7 crore to Rs 2,323 crore. Ebitda margin is expected to be around 11-12 percent.

The auto and farm equipment business posted Rs 13,305 crore in standalone revenue and Rs 1,686 crore in standalone net profit for the second quarter this fiscal.

Quarter-on-quarter, the standalone revenue is expected to rise 5.3 percent to 7.2 percent, and standalone net profit is may increase 17.5 percent to 58 percent.

The auto and farm equipment business posted Rs 19,612 crore in revenue and Rs 1,471 crore in standalone net profit in the first quarter of FY23.

According to analysts of Elara Capital, who have given conservative estimates for the net profit growth, raw-material inflation will continue to weigh on the bottomline. “While key input cost has pared sequentially in H1FY23, companies are yet to entirely recover the surge in cost from FY21 levels, which has compelled OEMs to compensate for RM cost inflation to ancillaries, with a quarter’s lag. Expect RM cost to decline going ahead in H2FY23, which will reflect in margins,” they said in their Q2 preview report. They added that their top picks include Mahindra and Mahindra.

At IIFL, analysts have given an aggressive estimate for net profit growth of 38 percent QoQ and 58 percent YoY, and have cited fall in commodities (to a small extent), price hikes and operating leverage as margin tailwinds. Among margin headwinds, adverse revenue mix and introductory pricing of Scorpio N were listed.

While Kotak Institutional Equities believe that margins will continue to be weighed down by raw-material price inflation and adverse product mix, the brokerage still expects net profit to go up by 33 percent on-quarter and 20 percent on-year “mainly on account of higher other income due to Rs 30 per share dividend payout by Tech Mahindra during the quarter”, the analysts wrote in their Q2 preview report.

The estimated Ebitda margin to be 11.3 percent for this quarter, or a decline of 60bps on-quarter because of inferior segmental mix with the volume share of tractors falling from 43.6 percent in Q1FY23 to 34.2 percent in Q2FY23, and because of the lagged impact of raw-material price rise."

Tractor sales have beat estimates this October, carrying forward the sales momentum the segment had begun to see in September. Sales touched record highs on improving sentiment.

The Street had estimated flat quarterly growth but sales went up by more than 12 percent. Mahindra and Mahindra, and Escorts Kubota made a record number of sales in October.

The largest tractor maker in India, Mahindra and Mahindra, saw around 11 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in sales volumes to nearly 52,000 units in the month, even as brokerages were expecting flat growth over this period.

The third-largest tractor manufacturer, Escorts Kubota sold 14,500 units in October, which according to brokerage Nomura was the highest ever monthly sales for the company. Its average sales volume this year (January to October 2022) has been around 8,688.7 units, and the average sales for the company in October over the past five years has been 13,632 units.

Overall, tractor registrations beat registrations during the 2021 festival season period by 66 percent, and it beat the pre-COVID 2019 festive period by 34 percent. Analysts put the good show down to ample supply of water thanks to good rains and favourable government policies.

“The domestic tractor industry reported a high single-digit y-o-y increase in volumes in October 2022. Festive demand was supported by above-normal monsoons and healthy water reservoir levels,” stated a recent report from Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE).

According to the Central Water Commission’s bulletin released on November 3, live storage available in the 143 reservoirs is 109 percent of the live storage level of the corresponding period last year, and 118 percent of the average of the last 10 years.

The KIE report also mentioned the increase in minimum supported prices (MSPs) announced on October 18. “Sentiment remains positive on account of higher MSP for Rabi crops, good moisture content in soil and good progress in Rabi sowing,” it added.

The government raised the MSP for all rabi (winter-sown) crops for the marketing season (April to March) of 2023-2024. Support prices of wheat, barley, gram, safflower, rapeseed and mustard, and lentil (masur) were increased by between Rs 100 and Rs 500 per quintal. Given all this, KIE’s analysts expects tractor volumes to grow 6 percent YoY in FY23, and then moderate to 4 percent in FY24 and FY25.

Nomura’s analysts estimate that there will be a 5 percent yearly decline in industry volumes in FY23, but said that they see an upside risk to that estimate.

What the Street forecasts

Analysts at Edelweiss gave a ‘buy’ call to Mahindra and Mahindra in their October 28 report, and cited the company’s tractor business as a key highlight. “The tractor business is in a sweet spot and well placed to benefit from robust industry demand and sustain market share gains, riding new launches and network expansion,” the report said.

The other highlights included the company’s utility vehicle business which the analysts believed would get back on track with the company intent on closing product gaps.

M&M’s Q2FY23 results will be out on November 11.

Escorts Kubota’s second-quarter results were below expectations, with a 190-basis point (bp) quarterly drop in operating profit margin, which stood at 8.1 percent in the September quarter. A Sharekhan November 4 report pegged this to “negative operating leverage, volume decline in construction equipment division and unabsorbed inflation of commodity and other costs”. The brokerage still holds a “positive” view on the stock, and the key positives included the growth in tractor revenue at 12.5 percent YoY; and market share gain in the segment of 70 bps YoY and 40 bps quarter-on-quarter to touch 9.7 percent. Escorts was renamed Escorts Kubota in June 2022 after its Japanese partner and agricultural machines maker Kubota increased its stake to 44.8 percent. Sharekhan’s analysts see this as a trigger for further growth.

“We believe that EKL’s partnership with Kubota would provide the company an opportunity to gain global market share going forward, driven by product launches across brands and increase the addressable markets,” their report stated.

“EKL is well-poised to gain market share in India and globally, driven by new product launches, an increase in share of non-agricultural-based tractors, increase in global footprints and beneficiary of a single exclusive vehicle of Kubota in India,” it added. Besides, the analysts are positive about the company’s strong balance sheet with zero debt, strong free cash flow and decent return on capital employed profile of 17-22 percent.

On the other hand, analysts at Asian Markets Securities have a ‘sell’ call on the stock. In their November 4 report, they commented on the company’s plan to transform from a tractor manufacturer to an agri-services provider.

“The company intends to provide complete crop solutions by offering implements and knowhow to farmers. ESC also plans to introduce an Uber-like model for tractors that makes mechanised solutions more affordable for small-scale farmers, besides laying the groundwork for commercial production of its electric tractor,” they stated.

According to the analysts, the company also plans to capture the higher end of the domestic tractor market with the Kubota offerings.

But according to the brokerage, despite its zero debt and healthy return ratios, and its transformative strategy that may work well in the mid- to long-term, the valuations are “rich to justify the near term growth”."

With the augmentation of semiconductor supplies to the global automotive industry, carmakers across the board are ramping up production lines in order to cut the prolonged waiting period of their bestselling models.

Leading carmakers such as Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Tata Motors, etc., have confirmed that easing supplies of semiconductor chips is resulting in a gradual increase in output on a month-on-month basis.

Furthermore, as sales remained buoyant in August, most of the companies have enhanced their dispatches ahead of the festive season.

As per ICRA estimates, the industry capacity utilization levels after dipping to ~60% during H1 FY2022, has ramped up to levels of ~80-85% for H1 CY2023. However, it maintained that 100 percent utilization may not be possible in the foreseeable future as the chip shortage may linger on till late next year.

Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker, revealed that it was currently operating at more than 96 percent of its installed capacity of 1.85 lakh units per month (including exports). A senior company official confirmed that production has improved due to improved semiconductor supplies.

Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director, marketing & sales, at Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL), recently said that, “In September (last year), the production level was only 40 percent. In October it inched up to 60 percent. The situation gradually continued to improve and we hit production utilization levels of 95 percent in May.”

Asked when the company expects to hit 100 percent utilization, Srivastava added, “We do not have visibility regarding availability of semiconductors in the future. We get updates every week and keep modifying our estimates. One thing I can tell you is that we will not see 100 percent normalization of production in the near future.’’

During a media interaction, the M&M brass said that the “semiconductor crisis is now abated,” and that the prolonged waiting period for its vehicles was largely due to ""unprecedented demand"".

They added that capacity addition involves lengthy lead times, and the company was looking to significantly ramp up production to cater to the growing demand for its bestselling vehicles — XUV700, Thar, and the recently-launched Scorpio-N.

“The wait time is being driven largely by demand. Capacity will take some time to ramp up, hence the wait times will not drop immediately. So, while the semiconductor situation has eased, it is demand that is driving the wait. We just have to get the capacity in place to address that. However, (in spite of the wait time) we’re not seeing any reduction in demand,” Anish Shah, Managing Director & CEO, M&M, told reporters at a post-results press conference.

Tata Motors, which too is reportedly producing at greater than 90 percent of capacity, maintained that the semiconductor shortage was under control even though not fully resolved. With wait times ranging between four weeks to three months for different passenger vehicles in its portfolio, the company is witnessing fresh demand for its vehicles, and ” pent-up demand” is over.

Shailesh Chandra, managing director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and and Passenger Electric Mobility recently revealed that if the demand in the market is ‘X’, it might be slightly behind that ‘X’ but not 70% of what needed earlier.

""The semiconductor situation is easing out, but remains uncertain in the short term. We continue to remain agile and flexible to the evolving situation and apply smart allocation across models to maximize production. We have also developed an alternative architecture for the affected parts, and collaborated with supplier-partners to fast track de-risking measures,"" said Chandra.

South Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor India, which is churning out 60,000 units (for both domestic and export markets) on an average per month, anticipates record sales this year, largely due to improved supplies and sustained demand for it sport utility vehicles (SUVs) such as Venue, Tucson, Creta, etc. A senior company official said that its domestic sales in 2022 will be the highest ever in the country.

“If you see, in Jan-May we were doing about 43,000-44,000 units a month. Now we are doing 48,000-49,000 units (doesn’t tally with the 60K figure in the para above). Things have improved by 10 percent. With the semiconductor situation improving and robust demand, we are confident that we will achieve the highest-ever domestic sales in history in CY22,” said Tarun Garg, director (sales, marketing, and service), Hyundai Motor India."

Emkay Global Financial's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

We attended M&M’s EV day, where the company re-iterated its future EV strategies. The recently showcased electric XUV400 model has been developed at an investment of Rs5- 6bn. The model features a superior range and acceleration in comparison to peers in the non-luxury segment. Bookings and dispatches are expected to commence in Q4FY23. Post XUV400 launch, four more electric models under XUV and BE brands, based on a dedicated platform (INGLO), are scheduled for launch over December 2024 to October 2026. Investments relating to the platform and model development are expected at an aggregate of Rs100bn over FY22-27. M&M will collaborate with Volkswagen for components such as electric drivetrain, battery system, and battery cells. We remain positive on M&M due to its sales upcycle across segments and a large order book in PVs (270,000+ units). We have raised our FY23-25E EPS estimates by 3-7%, factoring an increase in volume assumptions.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M unveiled first electric SUV – XUV400, based on its XUV300 subcompact SUV. With this launch, M&M has notched up the competition in the affordable e-SUV segment in India, which is currently ruled by Tata Nexon EV (Tata recorded 87% EV market share in FY22). XUV400 comes with a battery pack of 39.4 kWh, similar to Nexon EV Max’s 40.5 kWh. However, compared to 437km range in a single charge from a slightly bigger battery pack in Nexon EV Max, XUV400’s battery offers a longer range of 456km – owing to better technology. M&M believes, there remains a vast electric opportunity in the C-segment (4-4.5m), contrasting to Tata Nexon EV’s presence in the B-segment (3.85-4m, Nexon EV has 3.5% share in this segment). We expect XUV400 to come with a price tag of Rs 18-20 lakhs, similar to its competition Nexon EV Max. Price announcement, Bookings are expected in Jan-23, deliveries will commence from end of Jan-23. M&M is one of our preferred picks in the auto space given (1) back-to-back successful launches in the highly competitive SUV space, (2) its leadership position in tractor industry, (3) its proactiveness to leverage the EV trend can lead to value unlocking and (4) its well-played out capital allocation strategy. Currently, we are not assigning any value to EVCo, as it doesn’t have any material presence in e-PV segment.



Outlook

However, success of XUV400 along with market share gains can re-rate the stock. Reiterate BUY with a Jun-24 target price of Rs 1,400 (18x on core EPS and Rs 285 for subsidiaries).

Mahindra & Mahindra - 130922 - prabhu"
"September 13, 2022 04:34 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/will-mahindras-new-e-suv-xuv400-have-enough-firepower-to-take-on-tata-motors-e-nexon-9159381.html,"Mahindra XUV400

At a time when auto industry players across various segments were in quasi-marketing mode on World EV Day by talking about the green quotient of products and solutions, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) decided to go off the beaten track and unveiled its much awaited electric SUV -- Mahindra XUV400 -- a day earlier at Mahindra Research Valley (MRV) in Chennai. While the test drives of this electric SUV will kick off in December 2022, the bookings will commence from the first week of January 2023.

Before the product unveiling ceremony kicked off, this Moneycontrol reporter informally asked a senior official of the Mumbai-based company if the firm can actually pit its maiden electric SUV against market leader Tata Nexon electric variants (EV Prime and EV max), and the official exuded a lot of confidence, stating: “Our product’s features will let you know which product is a cut above the rest”

Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director, auto and farm sectors, M&M, said: “We believe we have what you call a very strong C-segment SUV. What our survey indicates to us is that 25 percent of SUV buyers and intenders rank electric vehicles at number 1. That is how large an opportunity it is.”

During a post-unveil Q&A session, when M&M was quizzed on the probable sales target, tentative price points for XUV400 and whether it will be able to outsell Tata Nexon in the future, he maintained, “This is more like a category creator rather than competing with any model. We are open to several price points. But we will reveal the final prices once we garner enough feedback from the market.”

It is to be mentioned that M&M’s compatriot Tata Motors had introduced Nexon (initially offered in ICE or internal combustion engine options) subcompact crossover in 2017. The electric version of the Nexon, which is currently priced at Rs 14.99 lakh and above, was revealed in December 2019 and went on to become the biggest selling e-car in the country in 2020. In the process, Tata Motors updated the name of the standard Tata Nexon EV to Tata Nexon EV Prime in order to differentiate from higher range model Nexon EV Max (launched in May 2022).

The XUV400, which is essentially an extended wheelbase version of XUV300 (run purely on ICE), is powered by a 39.4 kWh Lithium-ion battery pack with a range of 456 km (ARAI certified) on a single charge and the electric motor can churn out 147bhp of power output and 310Nm of peak torque. This car can also attain 0-100 km per hour acceleration in 8.3 seconds. The e-SUV is being positioned by M&M in the C-segment SUV category and is 4200 mm long and is the widest e-SUV in the category at 1821mm, as per M&M’s claims.

Tata Nexon EV Prime, on the other hand, is equipped with a 30.2 kWh battery pack with an ARAI-rated range of up to 312 km (on a single charge) and the electric motor produces 127bhp of maximum power and 245 Nm of peak torque. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 kmph in 9.9 seconds while achieving a top speed of 120 kmph. For EV Max, the electric motor produces 106.64 kW of maximum power and 250Nm of peak torque and goes from 0–100 kmph under nine seconds. It has a 40.5 kWh battery with an ARAI-rated range of up to 437 km on a single charge.

Tata Motors spokesperson, when contacted by Moneycontrol, didn't offer any comments either on the competitive offering by Mahindra or on its strategy to retain its current Nexon's marketshare.

While deliveries of the XUV400 are scheduled to begin from the end of January 2023, the first phase of the rollout will cover key urban cities such as Mumbai, Hyderabad, Delhi NCR, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Goa, Jaipur, Surat, Nagpur, Trivandrum, Nashik, Chandigarh and Kochi.

A prominent Mahindra dealer principal Moneycontrol spoke to said on the condition of anonymity, “We have been apprised by M&M that the tentative ex-showroom price should be retailed in the range of Rs 11-13 lakh and lower than Tata Motors’ Nexon EV. However, the attractive price tag is more to do with test marketing and gauging response to its XUV400 before the company introduces its Born Electric range of products beginning 2024.”

M&M had last month already announced its partnership with Volkswagen Group for sourcing components from the European automaker’s MEB (open platform for EVs) for its purpose-built electric vehicle platform INGLO. In the process, the homegrown utility vehicle maker is looking to roll out five electric SUVs under two brands—XUV and the all-new electric-only brand Born Electric (BE)—by 2027.

Numbers tilted in favour of Nexon so far

According to the Federation of Auto Dealers Association (FADA), 17,802 electric cars were sold in 2021-22; Tata Motors commanded an 85 percent share of the market thanks to phenomenal numbers generated by the electric variants of its Tigor and Nexon. However, M&M could manage to sell only 156 e-cars during that period.

During the first quarter of FY2023 too while Tata Motors’ retail sales were close to 7,000 units, M&M could barely dispatch 42 units because of lack of relevant product lines. In July 2022, 3,295 electric four wheelers were sold in India out of which Nexon EV managed to sell 2,878 units, which is 87.34 percent share of the market.

Despite lacklustre performance in the passenger EV space in the past, Mahindra sounded an optimistic note.

“When we look at market opportunity, we look at two buckets. While one is market segmentation and the second is about customer segmentation. In terms of market segment, the C-segment SUV market is about 32,000 units per annum and the B-segment is about 66,000 units per month. In terms of EV penetration, C –segment brands (of electric cars), one representing the 0.2 percent of the market, the other representing 0.7 percent of the market. In the B-segment, there is one electric vehicle which represents 3.5 percent of the market. The market opportunity for us is to drive penetration across the B and C segment offerings of the market,” added Jejurikar.

However, analysts are skeptical if M&M will be able to eat up Tata Nexon’s share in the e-SUV space. As Ranojoy Mukherji, auto industry writer and analyst, puts it, ""Mahindra seems to have a segment leader on its hands with the XUV400, but they need to sort out their logistics including production constraints at the earliest.""

Likewise, Puneet Gupta, director, S&P Global Mobility, feels that Nexon is a proven model with strong word of mouth. It will take some time for Mahindra to enjoy the same reputation. However, this category of buyers is more experiential so they may like to exercise other choices like XUV400. Tata has a better ecosystem of charging through its group companies,” maintains Gupta.​"

With the abatement of the pandemic and ‘travel to office’ becoming the new normal, several automakers are now working on strategies to introduce quadricycles in the next couple of years. While Bajaj Auto is working on reintroducing its Qute quadricycle in a greener avatar, others like Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Hero MotoCorp are also working on a timeline for foraying into this segment.

A step up from a traditional autorickshaw, quadricycles are positioned by OEMs as a safer, cleaner and more comfortable alternative to a three-wheeler. Even though they are called quadricycles, they are motorized vehicles with four wheels and are slightly bigger than a three-wheeler and smaller than a typical car.

As per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) data, passenger three-wheeler sales in the domestic market rose from 135,414 units in FY21 to 183,607 units in FY22. The number of quadricycles also went up from 12 units in FY21 to 124 units in FY22.

Bajaj, hitherto the only player in the market and which was selling the Bharat Stage (BS)-IV compliant Qute quadricycle in select cities in the domestic market until March 2020, has officially confirmed that it will be coming up with a version complying with the BS-VI emission norms in the medium term.

Bajaj Auto executive director Rakesh Sharma confirmed that the quadricycle, which is currently in the ‘business development’ phase, will see a commercial rollout once it is homologated by the Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) next year. He also confirmed that there will be an electrical Qute as well. “That will be available in the medium to long term,” he said.

Bajaj had introduced the Qute, initially named RE60, a rear-engine, rear-wheel drive, four-seater quadricycle, aimed primarily at the domestic market as a replacement for the ubiquitous autorickshaw.

M&M is gearing up to roll out a fully-electric quadricycle Atom by 2023. The product has been designed to meet last-mile connectivity needs and was scheduled for a rollout towards the end of 2020. However, its commercial rollout was delayed by the pandemic.

Even though M&M is yet to reveal the pricing and availability details of the Atom EV quadricycle, it is expected to be available at a starting price of around Rs 3 lakh (ex-showroom) and will be taking on the Bajaj Qute, which costs around Rs 2.5 lakh.

When contacted, an M&M spokesperson said, “We cannot give any guidance on the Atom’s availability at the moment. We will share the details closer to the launch.”

Hero MotoCorp is also believed to be exploring this segment. A company spokesperson, though, denied any such plans. A senior official, on condition of anonymity, had earlier told Moneycontrol.com that the company is working on a class-changing vehicle, which can be used interchangeably as a two-wheeler or a three-wheeler.

Piaggio India and Tata Motors, which were at one time reported to be working on their own quadricycles, had shelved their plans. It could not be ascertained if either of them has revived its plans to launch quadricycles.

The four-wheeled vehicle has had a rough run in India. “As a concept, a quadricycle is the perfect transition from a two-wheeler to a four-wheeler. It has been a popular mode of transport in Europe, especially in countries like France, with many automakers in this segment. It’s the perfect intracity low-speed runabout providing the ideal benefit mix of compact size, low taxes, low price and economical operation. In India, the quadricycle as an approved vehicle category had been stonewalled for a long time by small car makers citing safety concerns. If three-wheelers could be allowed to ply on the roads, so can the quadricycle,” said Avik Chattopadhyay, an auto industry consultant and cofounder of Expereal, a branding and marketing consultancy."
"August 17, 2022 07:10 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cars/will-partnership-with-vw-boost-mms-ev-fortunes-9046371.html,"Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M), which has primarily been focussing on diesel-powered Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) for many decades, is now training its guns on battery-operated electric vehicles (EVs).

With its recent announcement on allying with the Volkswagen Group for sourcing components from the European automaker’s MEB (open platform for EVs) for its purpose-built electric vehicle platform INGLO, the homegrown utility vehicle maker is looking to roll out five electric SUVs under two brands—XUV and the all-new electric-only brand Born Electric (BE)—by 2027.

Several analysts Moneycontrol spoke to reckon that the move, which is a win-win proposition for both partners, would lead to faster electrification in India and would support a rapid rollout of new EV products.

“Support on critical component supply from the German car maker would aid M&M on entire value chain of EV development. This would also create synergy between the two for future EV development in the Indian market. So it’s win-win situation for both,” said Mitul Shah, Head of Research at Reliance Securities.

Puneet Gupta of S&P Automotive believes that this partnership will give a new life to Mahindra as it has been primarily a diesel player.

Taking aim at 1 million units

“Even today, 70 percent of its sales are derived from diesel vehicles. So this announcement was very important for Mahindra for their survival as diesel (powertrain) is actually dying across the globe. On the other hand, VW has the upper hand as it will be able to capitalise on its MEB platform for which it has invested billions of euros. It will actually help VW in reducing the cost for its Indian projects as M&M will be making parts in India,” said Gupta.

While making the announcement, the partners revealed that the cooperation intends to have a volume of more than “one million units over lifetime” and that it includes the equipment for five all-electric SUVs with MEB components. M&M is also confident of selling 200,000 electric SUVs a year by 2027, which could potentially generate revenue of around Rs. 50,000 crore for its e-vehicle subsidiary (EVCo).

Furthermore, the company expects 30 percent of its sales to come from EVs in five years.

M&M revealed its ambitious plans at a time when electric cars are gaining a lot of traction and rival Tata Motors is experiencing unprecedented growth in its e-cars.

Tata Motors’ sales dwarf Mahindra’s

According to the Federation of Auto Dealers Association (FADA), 17,802 electric cars were sold in 2021-22; Tata Motors commanded an 85 percent share of the market thanks to phenomenal numbers generated by the electric variants of its Tigor and Nexon.

M&M could manage to sell only 156 e-cars during that period. During Q1 FY2023, while Tata Motors’s retail sales were close to 7,000 units, M&M could barely dispatch 42 units. This is because Mahindra does not have a significant presence in the electric passenger segment. However, it is the leading player in the domestic electric three-wheeler space with more than 70 percent market share.

An analyst from Prabhudas Lilladher said over the medium to long term, M&M's strategic partnership with VW can significantly contribute to the electrification of vehicles in India—a space currently dominated by Tata Motors.

Mansi Lall, Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, said, “The targets set by these companies can also aid market share gains for M&M. We now need to see how XUV400 (M&M's first EV) is priced and starts taking this market share from Tata's Nexon EV, because M&M’s planned launches will begin in December 2024, which is two-and-a-half years away. Mahindra should witness a healthy volume growth, 2HFY23 onwards, owing to it strong existing order book and XUV400 launch in the next month.”

Capital infusion

M&M earlier outlined plans for a capital infusion of Rs 10,000 crore in the EV business during FY23-27 for platform, powertrain and product development as well for building assets. This was after it announced the infusion of Rs 1,925 crore in its EV subsidiary by British International Investment (BII) at a valuation of $9 billion.

Out of Rs 10,000 crore earmarked, M&M is spending Rs 2,000 crore on EVCo.

“With funds coming from selling part stake in EV business to BII, M&M would use that for strategic investment in the EV space and this is the beginning towards that, we believe. So yes, it would surely be very important in terms of its journey in EVs and get prepared from a global perspective,” said Basudeb Banerjee, an analyst at ICICI Securities.

Considered a pioneer of the Indian EV industry, M&M took a majority stake in Chetan Maini-owned Reva Electric Car Co Ltd in 2010 and renamed it Mahindra Reva Electric Vehicles Pvt Ltd.

M&M further renamed the company Mahindra Electric Mobility and introduced e-cars like the e2O and e2O Plus but sales failed to meet expectations and the models were eventually phased out.

Partnerships that didn’t work

M&M is known for its multiple failed partnerships in India and abroad. The most recent it formed was with Ford in 2019 to create a joint venture that will work towards developing and selling cars in the domestic market. But thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, the JV was called off in less than two years.

More than a decade back, M&M acquired a controlling stake in SsangYong Motor of South Korea to expand its portfolio of premium SUVs in the Indian market. However, the South Korean brand was saddled with mounting debt and Mahindra was compelled to look for a new buyer.

M&M also bought out the 49 percent stake of its US joint venture partner Navistar Group in its commercial vehicle joint venture Mahindra Navistar Automotives Ltd (MNAL) and Mahindra Navistar Engines Pvt Ltd (MNEPL) in late 2012.

In 2007, Renault signed a partnership with Mahindra for the formation of Mahindra Renault Limited, a joint venture. They had to terminate the partnership as the Logan model failed to attract buyers. ​"

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) and Volkswagen Group on August 15 announced that they have expanded their cooperation and signed a term sheet, under which the German automaker will supply electric vehicle components to the Indian automaker.

Both the companies signed a term sheet on the supply of electric components by VW’s MEB (open platform for EVs) for Mahindra’s new, purpose-built electric platform INGLO, deepening the partnering agreement from earlier this year.

“The cooperation intends to have a volume of more than one million units over lifetime and includes the equipment of five all-electric SUVs (based on INGLO) with MEB components. In addition, the two companies will explore further opportunities for collaboration, opening the perspective towards a broader strategic alliance to accelerate the electrification of the Indian automotive market,” M&M said in a statement.

It was reported earlier that M&M plans to equip its Born Electric Platform with MEB electric components such as electric motors, battery system components and battery cells from Volkswagen.

Both parties had signed an agreement earlier to evaluate the scope of collaboration, and a binding supply contract could be forged by the end of 2022. MEB electric platform and its components allow car manufacturers to build their portfolio of electrified vehicles, quickly and cost-effectively.

The INGLO platform, which will power all of Mahindra's EVs, offers options ranging from 60-80 kilowatt hour (kWh) battery capacity and fast-charging of up to 80 percent in less than 30 minutes, M&M revealed without specifying the range of the EVs.

Commenting on the announcement, Rajesh Jejurikar, Executive Director, Auto and Farm Sectors, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., said: “Our purpose-built INGLO platform offers unmatched potential for growth and further customization for developing new and innovative products, not just for India, but for global markets. Our vision is to lead the electric mobility revolution in India by bringing authentic electric SUVs with cutting-edge technology, as showcased in the UK today.”"

Motilal Oswal's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

MM’s 1QFY23 operating performance was in line as the Auto business made up for weakness in the Tractor segment. While the Auto business is firmly on the growth path, led by a refreshed product portfolio, the outlook for the Tractor segment is uncertain, particularly for 2HFY23. The strong order backlog in SUV will continue to boost performance, aided by RM cost savings. Stability in the Tractor business will be a key performance driver.

Outlook

We raise our FY23/FY24 standalone EPS estimate by 7% each to factor in a strong order backlog in the Passenger UVs and improving semiconductor supplies. We maintain our Buy rating with a TP of INR1,400/share (Sep’24E based SoTP).

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M’s 1QFY23 EBITDA margin at 11.9% came slightly below our estimate of 12.2% owing to margin pressure in farm business (EBIT margin at 16% in 1Q vs 18-22% earlier), as company was unable to pass on inflated commodity cost. While the management expects tractor industry to report 3-5% growth in FY23 we anticipate outperformance on the back of its strong leadership position. Further, auto segment continues to be in limelight with 140k+ bookings (excl. 100k units of Scorpio-N), of which 79k units are for XUV700 (majorly for the top-end variants). Led by successful model launches, we believe that the company could regain 150-200bps of its lost SUV market share (from FY22 base of 15%) in the next 2 years. M&M is one of our preferred picks in auto space given (1) healthy turnaround in the segment with back-to-back successful launches in highly competitive SUV space (2) its proactiveness to leverage EV trend for value unlocking (3) strong leadership position in tractor industry and (4) well-played out capital allocation strategy.

Outlook

Reiterate ‘BUY’ at target price of Rs 1,400 (18x on Jun-24 core EPS and Rs 285 for subsidiaries).

Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra announced at the company’s 76th AGM on August 5 that the Q1 F23 results, “which have shown the growth pathway of the company and the Mahindra Group”, has been approved. He also pointed out that Mahindra’s Scorpio-N launch saw unprecedented response, with 25,000 bookings made in 60 seconds.

The Mahindra Group Chairman went on to deliberate on various global issues to highlight the importance of perspective, starting with increase in oil prices. He said: “Let us take the oil prices over the last 15 years and adjust them for inflation. In 2008, the oil price was the highest ever -- about $130 a barrel. If you take that figure and adjust it for inflation, it would cost about $300 in today's money. The highest price of oil in recent times is $120. It is actually lower than 2008 on an inflation-adjusted basis. Today's price is not great. But looked at through the lens of inflation, it's not devastating.”

He then went on to say that the war in Ukraine is teaching us a timely lesson about the dangers of overreliance on oil and the need for alternate energy sources.

Anand Mahindra added: “It also coincides with a climate change crisis which needs to be tackled on a war footing. It seems logical that this experience of oil supplies being negatively affected by war will shake us out of our complacency and give a much-needed fillip to the quest for renewable energy. Some good may yet come out of this deplorable situation.”

He further pointed out how the war in Ukraine has brought high-tech defence into focus, as Ukraine, though vastly outnumbered, has been able to hold its own due to the high-tech defence technology being poured in by NATO countries. “There is a lesson in that countries like ours need to be perpetually ready to defend our borders. High Tech defence will become a sunrise industry,” he said.

The business tycoon then went on to discuss “whether the United States will go into recession” and said while it is difficult to predict how a possible recession will play out in the US, there is a silver lining to it.

He explained: “India has always been resilient. If there is only a mild recession in the US, that is likely to be good for India. Our resilience will help bring capital inflows. Further, the recession will help reverse the commodity price rises and also perhaps induce the US Fed to put a cap on rising interest rates.”

Speaking about supply chain disruption, Anand Mahindra said: “In M&M, one of the main reasons for the long waiting periods for delivery of vehicles is that the availability of semiconductors had slowed down to a trickle. Those lamenting the demise of a global supply network are ignoring the fact that the disruption is in the China-dominated global supply network rather than the true global supply chain.”

He said that unshackling ourselves from China is a good development and the process of unshackling has already begun and explained that China may be losing its edge already. Sixty percent companies and 82 percent manufacturers now report their production slowed during the present outbreak due to lack of employees, inability to obtain supplies, or explicit factory halts resulting from the lockdowns.

“So, where is the opportunity in this scenario? There is likely to be significant supply chain restructuring. Companies and countries will look for alternate supply sources. This will create pockets of opportunity around the world. There is likely to be a significant supply chain restructuring, and India may well be one of the beneficiaries of this 'sourcing' diversification,” he added.

Elaborating on how China’s loss can be India’s gain, Anand Mahindra said: “US Foreign Secretary Antony Blinken made a speech recently where he called China ‘the most serious long-term challenge to international order’ and proposed, among other things, ‘to align with partners with shared interests who are opposed to China's overseas development policies.’ That is India's cue. We can be the balance against China. We can be the new player in the supply chain. The situation is rife with opportunities. We have but to seize the day.”

Explaining how overall, the current situation is full of opportunities for India, he said that though the rupee depreciation has caused inflation, it has remained in control due to sound fiscal and monetary management. Our inflation target deviation is well below those of most developed economies.

He added: “The rupee was overvalued, and it was inevitable that it would head towards finding its own level. This level helps boost export competitiveness and helps India's exports, which have grown 25 percent YoY. There are, however, some gaps we need to fill in to take full advantage of these opportunities. The most important of these is jobless growth.”

“The Indian unemployment rate is hovering around seven to eight percent, according to CMIE. This is because job growth has not kept pace with GDP growth. Only 40 percent of the labour force that is capable of working is actually working or looking for work. In the US, this labour participation rate is 60 percent. The biggest sufferers are youth and women. Though the government is trying to do its bit by announcing plans to hire 1 million people in govt jobs by 2023, given we have a 900-million-strong workforce, there's a lot more to do.”

In conclusion, the Mahindra Group Chair said: “Let's set aside our fears and step up to bat…. I believe industry should have faith in the future and invest. The world is changing, and there are opportunities waiting to be seized. We seize these opportunities and turn our fortunes around. A little bit of calculated risk, a little bit of courage will pay rich dividends. To quote FDR, we have nothing to fear but fear itself …”"

Led by Mahindra & Mahindra, auto stocks rose again on August 1, buoyed by strong monthly sales data. The largest Indian maker of utility vehicles gained after recording 100,000 orders for the all-new Scorpio-N within 30 minutes of the commencement of bookings.

The Nifty auto index rallied 410 points, or 3.3 percent, to end at record closing high of 12,953.65.

The index has been making higher highs and higher lows since mid-May despite volatility in benchmark indices, rising more than 35 percent since March lows.

Mahindra & Mahindra was the biggest gainer with a 6.2 percent rise, hitting a record high after receiving stellar demand for the Scorpio-N, bookings for which opened on Saturday.

Even its automobile sales increased by 30.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) to 56,148 units, though tractor sales fell 14 percent to 23,307 units in July.

Prabhudas Lilladher raised its domestic passenger vehicle (PV) volume estimates for M&M by around 3 percent and 2 percent, and earnings per share by 1 percent each for FY23 and FY24 respectively, and the June 2024 target price to Rs 1,400 (versus Rs 1,380 earlier), considering the extraordinary response to Scorpio-N and improving chip supplies.

""We are positively surprised with M&M's Scorpio-N clocking over 1 lakh bookings within 30 minutes of its commencement. Scorpio-N’s deliveries will begin from September 26, 2022 and M&M aims at delivering 20,000 units by December 2022 (i.e. average monthly run-rate of around 6.6k units) and this is despite its existing order book of 143,000 units,"" said the brokerage.

Also read - Nifty rallies 14% in 1.5 months to hit 17,300 points. Is it time to book profits?

M&M is one of Prabhudas Lilladher's preferred picks in the auto space given (1) a healthy turnaround in its auto segment through back-to-back successful launches in the highly competitive SUV space (2) its proactive leveraging of the electric vehicle trend that can lead to value unlocking (3) its leadership position in the tractor industry and (4) its well-played out capital allocation strategy.

Tata Motors was the second biggest gainer, rising 6.6 percent after the company reported a 51 percent year-on-year increase in July sales at 81,790 units, though on a low base as the year-ago month sales were affected by the second Covid wave.

Auto ancillary stocks Sona Comstar, Balkrishna Industries, Bosch, MRF, and Bharat Forge gained between 2 percent and 4 percent.

Commercial vehicle maker Ashok Leyland rose 3.5 percent as the company sold 13,625 units in the month gone by, up 58 percent compared to 8,650 units sold in same month last year.

TVS Motor Company gained 2 percent, while Bajaj Auto rose 1.5 percent despite a 15 percent YoY decline in exports, as domestic sales grew by 9 percent YoY to 183,000 units, which resulted into a 4 percent decline in total sales for the month at 354,000.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

We are increasing FY23/24 EPS estimates by 11.4/19.6% and SoTP based target price to Rs 1,380 (earlier Rs 1,155), due to healthy turnaround in M&M’s auto story and likely gains from decline in inputs costs (steel prices down ~25% from peak levels). We position M&M as one of our preferred picks in the autos space given (1) visible benefits from change of management (2) growth revival in automotive segment from robust product pipeline, strong order book and semiconductor supply issues easing out (3) 200bps market share gain in tractor segment (market leader with 40% share) plus strong leadership in high growth farm implements segment and (4) >300bps margin expansion over FY22-25E, led by fading commodity inflation and operating leverage. Over last three months, M&M’s stock has outperformed the Nifty Auto Index – M&M ~30% vs Nifty Auto ~15% on the back of (1) unprecedented acceptance of its four consecutive UV model launches resulting in an order book of +143k units (2) launch of new Scorpio-N and (3) potential value unlocking in its EV-PV subsidiary (investment of Rs 19.25bn by BII in a valuation band of ~Rs 404-700bn). We believe that the stock will trade at a premium to its historic P/E given (1) its revamped SUV business with success in premium UV segment and (2) improved capital allocation strategy (as it moves closer to 18% RoE targets).

Outlook

Maintain ‘BUY’ with SoTP based Jun-24 target price of Rs 1,380 (18x P/E on core business and Rs 285 for subsidiaries at 30% holdco discount). We are not factoring in any value for EVCo, however with success of XUV400 there can be re-rating of the stock.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Mahindra and Mahindra

MM has announced that British International Investment Plc (formerly CDC Capital) will invest Rs19.25bn by way of CCPS in its E-PV subsidiary (EVCo) for a post-conversion equity stake of 2.75-4.76% in FY28. The eventual stake will depend on the EVCo’s revenue achievements by FY27. Investments by BII and MM in the EVCo will be utilized to create an E-UV portfolio. Four products are expected to be launched on new dedicated platforms over FY25-27, while one product (XUV 400) will be launched on the existing platform in Sep’22. The aspirational sales target is 200,000 units, representing a 30% EV share by FY27. We remain positive on MM due to the sales upcycle across segments and a large orderbook in PVs (~170,000 units). We raise FY23-24E EPS estimates by 5% based on a 3% increase in our volume assumptions. Following the revision, our FY22-24E revenue/earnings CAGRs stand at 22%/24%.

Outlook

We retain Buy with a higher SOTP value of Rs1,390 (Rs1,250 earlier), as we add Rs233/sh for the E-PV subsidiary, based on 3.3x FY27E EV/sales, discounted to present value. However, the standalone fair value has reduced by 10% as we factor in the valuation of only ICE-PV business.

Sharekhan's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

British International Investment has committed to invest up to $250 million in M&M’s passenger electric vehicle subsidiary (EVCo) at a valuation of $5.1-8.8 billion. More investors likely to invest in EVCo at a later stage. Promoters, along with investors would infuse ~Rs. 10,000 crore in the new EVCo between FY22-FY27, to launch five EV models, and leverage from M&M’s ecosystem of suppliers, dealers and financers. We firmly believe that M&M is on track with its growth roadmap.

"July 09, 2022 02:39 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cars/mm-forms-subsidiary-for-ev-4-wheelers-to-roll-out-4-cars-by-fy26-8799171.html,"Mahindra was the first major OEM in India to enter the electric car segment.

Automobile major Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) has formed an unnamed subsidiary (EV Co), for the launch of electric four-wheelers in global markets. To be asset light in nature, the newly formed entity will also look after sales, customer care, marketing, supply chain coordination, product strategy, planning, HR and finance of Electric passenger vehicles. Apart from Mahindra-branded vehicles, it may use its own brand of products.

The subsidiary was launched a day after M&M received a Rs 1,925-crore commitment from British International Investment (BII) through a binding agreement of equal investment from each sides into EV Co. The investment from BII will come in two tranches – Rs 1,200 crore by June 2023 and Rs 725 crore later on. BII will have stake of up to 4.8% in the form of convertible instruments at a valuation of up to Rs 70,070 crore.

“This investment by BII is only for passenger four-wheelers,” confirmed Anish Shah, managing director and chief executive of Mahindra Group. “Separate announcements will be made on three-wheelers and other segments,” he added. He had stated a day earlier that M&M would work jointly to bring other like-minded investors in EV Co to match the funding requirement in a phased manner. He clarified that the external investment will help the company reduce its earlier earmarked capex of Rs 10,000 crore by Rs 1,925 crore.

EV Co aims to roll out four cars, under its ‘Born–Electric’ (Ground-up EV) platform by FY2026. This will be in addition to the XUV400 scheduled for launch in September 2022, with deliveries to start in January-March 2023.

Rajesh Jejurikar, Executive Director, Auto and Farm Sectors at M&M, believes that the electric SUV market is at an inflection point and the company aspires to be a leader in that category “We would outline our long term vision, which includes our comprehensive product, technology, and platform strategy, at the UK event on August 15, 2022, followed by a reveal of the electric XUV 400 in September 2022. By 2027, we would expect 20-30 percent of Mahindra SUVs out of the entire portfolio being electric and that means annual sales of two lakh unit,” he said.

“It’s a master stroke!” said Puneet Gupta, analyst from S&P. “The electrification is taking off in India and is alluring companies to go on full throttle in terms of restructuring their organisation and look for alliances. This will help M&M to align with future and give them a direction to work in full swing into the EV world.”

Sameer Usgaonkar, Director, Head of Project Finance South Asia at BII, maintained that EV Co is expected to hit a valuation based on “specific milestones” that will be achieved by the company in the future. “We did extensive due diligence, including a series of meetings with the management team and got comfortable with that valuation,” he said.

Mahindra was the first major OEM in India to enter the electric car segment. After taking over Chetan Maini-owned Reva Electric Car Company, it formed Mahindra Electric and introduced cars like e2O and e2O Plus. But sales failed to meet expectations and these models were eventually phased out.

Rival Tata Motors had announced last October that TPG Rise Climate along with its co-investor ADQ would invest Rs 7,500 crore (around $1 billion) in a new subsidiary – to be incorporated soon – to focus exclusively on electric vehicles (EVs) at a valuation of up to $9.1 billion. Tata Motors has already declared a $2-billion investment plan for its EV subsidiary.

“We’re now looking forward to more news on VW-Mahindra Electric partnership which will give further fuel to this alliance,” summed up Gupta."

A drop in the price of crude oil and a correction in metal prices has prompted stock market bulls to take over the automobile sector.

The Nifty auto index closed above the 12,100 mark for the first time since its launch in 2011 and ended at a record closing high of 12,114.1 on July 7, rising 1.35 percent over the previous session.

Technically, the index has been making higher highs and higher lows since hitting its nadir in March, gaining more than 31 percent during the period, much more than any sectoral index.

MACD, or moving average convergence divergence, has indicated a positive trend on daily, weekly as well as monthly charts, while oscillators are also pointing to positive sentiment on all scales.

After a strong gap-up opening on July 7, the auto index formed a bullish candle on the daily chart. A bullish candle was still on the weekly as well as monthly charts.

Even the exponential moving average (EMA) indicated a positive trend. The index's five-day EMA moved above 13 DEMA as well as 26 DEMA, which can be considered a golden crossover, on June 23 and has sustained above these levels.

Tata Motors, MRF, Mahindra & Mahindra, Balkrishna Industries, Exide Industries, Tube Investments of India, Bharat Forge, Eicher Motors, and Amara Raja Batteries gained 1-3.5 percent.

The cooling off of metal prices was the biggest driver for the sector. Metal forms the major portion of auto companies' operating expenses. All metal prices corrected in double digits, while the Nifty metal index has lost more than 30 percent from its high.

Policy tightening announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seems to have been priced in by the sector, which is also hopeful that the central bank would be sticking to pre-COVID repo rate levels in upcoming policy meetings, experts said.

They also said a revival in auto sales in the last few months after the easing of a semiconductor shortage and consistent spending on infrastructure by the government has boosted investor sentiment. The monsoon's progress has raised hopes of better prospects for the rural market.

""As compared with June 2021, most automobile manufacturers reported growth in the wholesale volumes in June 2022. Any positive development with respect to improvement in rural sentiment and easing of supply chain constraints will support volume growth going ahead,"" said Arun Agarwal, Deputy Vice President at Kotak Securities.

A decline in oil prices is also playing a supportive role for the sector. Oil prices traded at around $100-101 a barrel in the international markets against $123 a barrel the previous month.

If there is a consistent fall in oil prices going forward, the government may reduce fuel prices, which can be another positive factor for the auto industry, experts said.

The auto stocks have been investors' favourites as the index hit a nearly eight-month high on July 6, ahead of the June quarter earnings season.

The Nifty Auto index surged 2.6 percent or Rs 302 to 11,952.2, the highest closing level since November 18, 2021.

After a recent low touched on June 20, the index has rallied nearly 11 percent and from March lows, it has risen more than 29 percent, which has been the highest among sectors. The rally has been on the back of a decline in metal prices, the key raw material used by the sector. The Nifty Metal index, on the other hand, has corrected more than 31 percent from its all-time high hit in April this year.

On Wednesday, most stocks participated in the rally with Tube Investment of India being the biggest gainer - up 8.5 percent. Eicher Motors, Maruti Suzuki India, Hero MotoCorp and Bosch gained more than 3 percent each, while MRF, Bajaj Auto, and Mahindra & Mahindra climbed over 2 percent each.

June Sales Performance

In the recently ended month, passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle segments reported strong performance on a year-on-year as well as a sequential basis, though there was a decline in tractors sales on a high base of last year.

""Commercial vehicle (CV) sector continued to shine as its underlying drivers are very much in place. Passenger vehicles (PV) have a strong order book but supply concern still prevails,"" LKP Securities said.

Interestingly, the chip shortage is resolving at a good pace now and is expected to get resolved by the festive season. New launches coupled with existing demand are expected to act positively on the PV sector, the brokerage added.

On the two-wheeler segment, LKP said the marriage season in rural parts of North India yielded some positivity in 2-wheeler sales. ""Sentimentally, too, we see 2-wheeler demand moving up. The low base of last year is also helping.""

The brokerage remains positive on the entire automobile sector and its top picks are Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti Suzuki India, Mahindra & Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, and Tata Motors.

Every dip in these stocks in the short term (driven by higher input costs, supply chain issues etc), shall provide good opportunities for investors to enter into them from a medium to long-term perspective, LKP advised.

The automobile retail registration data reported by FADA indicates total vehicle retail for June 22 increased by 27 percent YoY with growth across categories i.e. 2-wheeler, 3-wheeler, PV, tractors and CV. However, compared with the pre-COVID level of June 2019, total vehicle retail was down by 9 percent with a sharper decline in 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler.

""Though few categories are consistently showing recovery, full recovery is yet to be witnessed when compared to pre-covid times. Increased wholesale reflects ease in semi-conductor availability thus reducing supply side constraints going ahead,"" said Mitul Shah, Head of Research at Reliance Securities.

He expects a strong bounce back in 2HFY23 with rural recovery post favourable monsoon and further ease on semiconductor availability. He further expects YoY volume growth across categories in FY23E with M&HCVs and 3Ws expected to record more than 30 percent growth.

All eyes on earnings season

The auto companies' earnings are expected to be robust on a year-on-year basis as the base was impacted by the second COVID wave, while the sequential performance may be moderately lower due to chip shortage issue in the PV segment, and seasonality-led decline in CV, which is on expected lines, but given the easing raw material prices, the margin may bottom out in June quarter, experts said.

""Near normal economic activity, healthy retail sales (Q1FY23 averaging at around 92 percent of pre-Covid levels), robust demand in PV segment amid new launches in the SUV domain, cut in excise duty on fuels (Rs 8 per litre on petrol, Rs 6 per litre on diesel) in May 2022 and plummeting key raw material prices (mainly metals) towards the fag end of the quarter post their peak in April-May 2022 were the key highlights for Q1FY23,"" ICICI Direct said.

The brokerage expects total industry volumes in Q1FY23 to jump up around 10 percent QoQ led by the robust performance of the industry leader in the 2-wheeler space with the rest of the categories (PV, 3-wheeler, CV) witnessing de-growth QoQ.

Kotak Institutional Equities forecasts revenues for the auto stocks under its coverage to decline by 1 percent QoQ in Q1FY23 led by chip shortage impacting PV production volumes and a decline in CV segment volumes due to seasonality, which will be offset by a recovery in the 2-wheeler segment volumes and higher average selling prices.

The research house expects EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to decline by 6 percent QoQ due to raw material headwinds.

After excluding Tata Motors, ICICI Direct expects the segment to report 1.5 percent QoQ topline growth & around 10 bps QoQ margin improvement with PAT expected to decline 9.7 percent QoQ primarily tracking exceptional gains in Q4FY22 (Ashok Leyland, Bajaj Auto).

However, on a YoY basis, operational performance is likely to be robust at high double-digit growth due to COVID impacted lower sales in the base year, the brokerage said.

Technical View

Technically, the Nifty Auto index has seen a robust bullish candlestick pattern formation, which resembles a Bullish Engulfing kind of pattern. On the monthly as well as weekly scale, too, there was a bullish candlestick formation.

MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicated that the trend is positive while RSI and Stochastic also showed positive sentiments on the daily, weekly as well as monthly scales.

The market ended yet another volatile week on a mildly positive note, with the Nifty smartly defending the crucial 15,700 mark on July 1. On the first day of the July series, most sectors, barring oil & gas, helped the market recover and narrow losses.

The Nifty rose 53 points to close at 15,752 during the week ended July 1, taking support at 15,500 as well as 15,700. After getting support at around 15,190 in the previous two weeks, the index formed higher lows in the last week, which experts say is a good sign, with resistance at 15,900-16,180.

The index formed a kind of a bearish Hammer pattern on the weekly scale, and on the daily charts, a bullish hammer, which is generally a trend-reversal pattern.

Oscillators or sentiment indicators showed a marginal uptick on the weekly charts. The relative strength index moved up from 40.49 levels to 41.1. The Stochastic gave a positive crossover, climbing up from 17.6 to 19.4 levels.

""Till the Nifty trades above the 15,500 mark, one should continue to trade with a positive bias and look for stock-specific buying opportunities in the coming week,"" Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com said.

On the higher side, he said 15,850-15,900 is seen as the immediate near-term resistance on the lower timeframe charts and a breakout should lead the Nifty to the retracement marks of 15,990 and 16,180.

Here are the top 10 trading ideas from experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on closing prices on July 1:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,107 | Stop-Loss: Rs 970 | Target: Rs 1,180-1,330 | Return: 7-20 percent

The stock is forming a series of higher tops and higher bottoms, which is extremely positive. It has again surpassed its previous high of Rs 1,060 last week with the decisive dismissal. Such a pattern helps the stock to move into a new bullish segment.

The level of Rs 970 will be a great support for the stock and as long as it trades above it, the chances of reaching Rs 1,180 or Rs 1,330 will be bright.

The strategy should be to buy at Rs 1,110 and add more at Rs 1,000. Place the last stop-loss at Rs 970.

Bajaj Finserv: Buy | LTP: Rs 11,323 | Stop-Loss: Rs 10,700 | Target: Rs 13,000 | Return: 15 percent

The stock has bounced back strongly after completing a corrective pattern at Rs 10,727, which is positive. The breakout is decisive and depending on the formation, it can extend to Rs 12,300-13,000 in the next few weeks.

The strategy should be to buy partly at current levels and on the downside, at Rs 10,900. Protect long position with the final stop-loss at Rs 10,700.

Cipla: Buy | LTP: Rs 949.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 900 | Target: Rs 1,030 | Return: 8.5 percent

After hitting the support at Rs 900, it is forming a double bottom. It has taken almost a month, which is positive for the stock and may help it move upwards.

It is advisable to buy between Rs 950 and Rs 930 for targets of Rs 1,000 and Rs 1,080, where the stock has a multiple resistance zone. Keep stop-loss at Rs 900.

Expert: Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking

Hindustan Unilever: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,282.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,230 | Target: Rs 2,390 | Return: 5 percent

We’ve been seeing decent buying in the FMCG space and HUL is trading in sync with the trend. After a marginal dip, it has formed a fresh buying pivot while holding firmly above the support zone of multiple moving averages (100 and 200 exponential moving averages) and looks set for a surge.

We recommend creating fresh longs within the Rs 2,275-2,285 level.

United Breweries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,495.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,400 | Target: Rs 1,675 | Return: 12 percent

UBL has been trading with the corrective bias for the last eight months. Though it made a couple of attempts to surpass the resistance hurdle of the declining trendline but failed.

At the same time, it upheld the support zone at around Rs 1,400. The chart pattern and positioning of indicators are pointing towards the possibility of a breakout soon. We recommend accumulating within the Rs 1,485-1,495 zone.

Expert: Subash Gangadharan, Senior Technical and Derivative Analyst, HDFC Securities

Godrej Properties: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,227.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,160 | Target: Rs 1,310 | Return: 7 percent

After correcting from a high of Rs 2,598 in October 2021, Godrej Properties found support at around Rs 1,130 in June 2022. The stock has found support around the same level recently past and it also coincides with the 200 weeks simple moving average (SMA). On July 1, the stock reversed its downtrend by crossing its previous swing high of Rs 1,230 during the day.

Technical indicators are giving positive signals, as the stock is trading above the 20 and 50-period SMA on the 60 minutes chart. Momentum readings like the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), too, are in a rising mode and not overbought, which implies potential upsides.

With the realty index also showing signs of strength, we expect the stock to move up towards its previous intermediate highs in the coming weeks. Buy between Rs 1,220 and 1,224, with a stop-loss at Rs 1,160 and target at Rs 1,310.

Mphasis: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,241 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,370 | Target: Rs 2,040 | Return: 9 percent

Mphasis is in a short-term downtrend as it has been making lower tops and lower bottoms for the last several weeks after breaking the support of Rs 2,824. Recently, the stock slipped from the 20-day SMA and ended lower on the back of above-average volumes.

With the stock trading below key moving averages like the 20 and 50-day SMAs, the 14-week RSI in a decline mode and the intermediate technical setup looking negative, we believe the stock is headed lower in the coming weeks.

We recommend a sell between Rs 2,235 and Rs 2,245, with a stop-loss at Rs 2,370 and the target at Rs 2,040.

Expert: Jatin Gohil, Technical & Derivative Research Analyst, Reliance Securities

Ashok Leyland: Buy | LTP: Rs 146.3 | Stop-Loss: Rs 134 | Target: Rs 166 | Return: 13.5 percent

In the last week, the stock surpassed its medium-term supply zone (placed between Rs 139 and Rs 142) convincingly and rose to a seven-month high of Rs 149 with better volumes.

Its key technical indicators are positively poised on major timeframe charts. The stock has the potential to move towards lifetime high of Rs 153.5 initially and Rs 166 subsequently, which coincides with its prior highs (Rs 139 and Rs 153.5), connecting a rising trendline.

Havells India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,111 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,037 | Target: Rs 1,230 | Return: 11 percent

The stock formed a strong base around its prior lows (Rs 958 and Rs 1,037) connecting the rising trendline and is poised for a rebound.

Its daily RSI has witnessed a bullish divergence after a trendline breakout, which signals strength in the stock.

This could lead the stock towards Rs 1,190 and Rs 1,230 subsequently. In case of decline, the stock will find support around its prior swing low.

SBI Life Insurance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,099.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,033 | Target: Rs 1,185 | Return: 8 percent

The stock respected its lower band of the ascending channel and is poised for the next leg of upmove.

Its daily RSI again reversed from the bull market support zone (33-40) and gave a buy signal. In the past, the stock witnessed a decent rise after an identical buy signal.

The stock could move towards the upper band of the channel in the short term. On the lower side, the stock will find support around the lowest level of March 2022.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com

United Spirits: Buy | LTP: Rs 788.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 754 | Target: Rs 830-850 | Return: 5-8 percent

In the last few months, the prices have corrected within a channel and the stock has reversed from the support end of the pattern. On July 1, the stock also gave breakout from a falling trendline resistance with better than its daily average volumes.

The 'RSI Smoothed' oscillator has recently given a positive crossover and is indicating a positive momentum. Looking at the technical evidence, we expect the stock to rally higher in the near term.

Traders can buy the stock in the range of Rs 790-785 for potential targets of Rs 830 and Rs 850 in two-three weeks. The stop-loss should be placed below Rs 754.

Chalet Hotels: Buy | LTP: Rs 327.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 316 | Target: Rs 349 | Return: 6.5 percent

The stock had seen a time-wise correction in the last couple of months, where prices traded within a range and relatively outperformed the broader markets. On July 1, the stock gave a breakout from the resistance-end of this consolidation and hence the stock seems to have resumed its uptrend.

The short-term moving average has given a positive crossover to the medium term and the relative strength index (RSI) oscillator is in buy mode and has indicated a positive momentum.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock in the range of Rs 328-325 for a potential target of Rs 349 in the near term. The stop-loss can be placed below Rs 316.

"July 02, 2022 07:02 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cars/as-semiconductor-crisis-abates-carmakers-see-upward-shift-in-numbers-8768941.html,"June was an eventful time for the auto industry, marked by record rollouts in the sport utility vehicle or SUV space. This coincided with the global semiconductor supply shortage moderating, which resulted in vehicle production returning to near-normal levels. This in turn pushed up car sales, given that the chip shortage had led to long waiting times for would-be buyers. This was particularly true for OEMs or original equipment manufacturers with a line-up of SUVs in their arsenal, given the steady popularity of the segment.

Market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) recorded total sales of 155,857 units in June 2022, a 5.76 percent rise from 147,368 units sold in June 2021. The company’s total volumes generated in the month include domestic sales of 125,710 units, sales to other OEMs of 6,314 units and exports of 23,833 units. Its total domestic sales went up by 1.29 percent on an annualised basis to 132,024 units in June 2022 against 130,348 units in June 2021.

MSIL, while sharing the numbers, maintained that the shortage of electronic components had a “minor impact” on the production of vehicles, mainly in domestic models. The company took all possible measures to minimize the impact, it said.

Hyundai Motor India, which had lost the number two status in sales to Tata Motors a month back, regained its position with domestic sales of 49,001 units (up 21 percent) and exports of 13,350 units, yielding a total sales figure of 62,351 units for the month.

Tarun Garg, director (sales, marketing and service), Hyundai Motor India, said, “With the semiconductor situation showing signs of easing out, the sales number have again started showing a positive trend. Further, the newly launched Hyundai Venue has been receiving tremendous customer response.”

Meanwhile, Tata Motors continued to see growth in sales, recording an all-time high monthly passenger vehicles sales of 45,197 units last month, growing by a huge 87 percent from a year earlier. Sales in the first quarter of FY23, at 130,125 units, was also the highest ever, surging 102 percent over the same quarter last year. Despite that, however, the Indian automaker could not maintain the second spot in the domestic car industry.

Shailesh Chandra, managing director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility, said, “Demand for passenger vehicles continued to stay strong in Q1FY23 even as the supply side remained moderately impacted due to the lockdown in China. Overcoming the challenges, Tata Motors posted record-breaking monthly sales (June 2022) as well as quarterly sales (Q1FY23).”

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) said its total auto sales for June 2022 stood at 54,096 vehicles. In the utility vehicles (UV) segment, M&M sold 26,620 vehicles in the month, 60 percent above year-earlier monthly sales. The passenger vehicles segment (which includes UVs, cars and vans) saw sales of 26,880 units in June 2022. Exports for the month stood at 2,777 vehicles.

Veejay Nakra, president, automotive division, M&M, said, “Q1FY23 is our second consecutive highest SUV sales quarter due to continuing robust demand for all our brands including XUV700, Thar, Bolero and XUV300. We sold 26,620 SUVs in June and overall, 54,096 vehicles, registering a growth of 64 percent.”

Kia India too, which managed to sell 24,024 cars in June 2022, registered its highest-ever monthly sales. The South Korean carmaker achieved a year-on-year growth of 60 percent as it sold 15,015 units in the same period last year.

Hardeep Singh Brar, vice-president and head of sales and marketing, Kia India, said, “Despite the global supply chain constraints, we are still managing to achieve milestones in record time."""

M&M has launched all new model, the Scorpio-N at an aggressive price and added new technology and safety features, making it a compelling buy for customers.

After a day’s break, auto stocks were back in the limelight with the sectoral index gaining more than 1 percent on June 28 and recouping the previous day's losses. The consistent buying came ahead of monthly sales data which will be released from July 1.

Among auto and auto ancillary stocks, Tube Investments of India jumped more than 7 percent, followed by Mahindra &Mahindra, Ashok Leyland, TVS Motor Company, Bharat Forge, and MRF that gained 1.5-3 percent.

Exide Industries, Bajaj Auto, Tata Motors, Eicher Motors, Maruti Suzuki, Bosch, Hero MotoCorp, Balkrishna Industries, and Amara Raja Batteries also ended in the green.

The Nifty auto index closed 1.25 percent higher at 11,832, taking the total gain to more than 10 percent since it hit a recent low on June 20. The major reason behind the outperformance is the stability in metal prices, which is a key material for vehicle makers.

June sales expectations

June sales figures are expected to show that all automobile segments barring tractors and two-wheelers posted strong growth year-on-year largely on a low base in 2021 when India was battling the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Emkay Global Financial Services conducted a channel check to gauge the sales volumes in June. ""The channel checks indicate commercial vehicles (CVs) maintaining positive growth momentum on a sequential basis in June 2022. Tractor volumes are also likely to trend higher in a seasonally strong month,"" the securities firm said.

Further, ""2-wheelers volumes would be better for most original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) thanks to a ramp-up in production. In comparison, passenger vehicle (PV) volumes should be a mixed bag for listed OEMs,"" it added.

In the commercial vehicles segment, on a sequential basis, Emkay expects positive sales growth for Ashok Leyland at 9 percent, Tata Motors at 8 percent and Eicher Motor-VECV at 1 percent, and a slight decline for M&M at 5 percent.

Among makers of passenger vehicles, domestic sales by volume should grow 2 percent month-on-month at Tata Motors, Emkay said. It predicted a decline of 1 percent for Maruti Suzuki and 3 percent for M&M.

For the industry, Emkay expects a sequential improvement due to better production and higher dispatches to dealerships. ""Vehicle discounts have decreased month-on-month and remain significantly lower than the elevated levels seen in the past,"" it said.

Tractor sales by volume are likely to improve month-on-month, with a growth of 11 percent for Escorts and 10 percent for M&M in the domestic market. Sales growth has been restricted in the countryside because farmers have been hit by lower crop realizations in recent months, the research house said.

In the two-wheeler space in the domestic market, on a sequential basis, Bajaj Auto may report 4 percent growth in sales, Royal Enfield 3 percent, and TVS Motor 2 percent after a ramp-up in production and higher demand from salaried individuals and students, it said.

Emkay expects an 8 percent decline for Hero MotoCorp in domestic sales. Last month was better for Hero MotoCorp because of the strong demand in the marriage season.

Emkay Global has retained a positive view on the auto sector. ""Among OEMs, we are positive on Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Escorts, while in the ancillaries segment, we prefer Motherson Sumi and Minda Industries,"" it said.

Technical setup

Technically, the auto index is looking strong as it has formed a bullish engulfing candlestick pattern on the daily charts, indicating the uptrend may stay intact. Since the March lows, the index has been making higher highs and higher lows, which is a positive indication.

Even moving average convergence and divergence (MACD), the trend indicator, has retained its uptrend. The relative strength index has moved to the 66 levels. On a weekly basis, too, these indicators posted a positive trend.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Mahindra and Mahindra

We attended the unveiling ceremony of Scorpio-N, which is targeted at upmarket urban customers. This model is superior to existing Scorpio Classic in terms of power and ridehandling, and sports an all-new design with comprehensive safety/connectivity features. Scorpio-N is developed with an investment of Rs16bn and has a production capacity of 6,000 units per month. It would compete with models like Tata Safari, Toyota Innova, Hyundai Alcazar, etc. Similar to XUV700, it will be launched at a competitive price, which will be applicable to the first 25,000 units. MM’s order book stands at ~170,000 units, and the Scorpio-N launch on July 30 will further support bookings. Considering expectations of a staggered improvement in chip supplies and a large order book, we raise volume estimates by ~3% each for FY23 and FY24. We increase our FY23/FY24 EPS estimates by 6% due to an increase in margin assumptions.



Outlook

We have a Buy rating with a TP of Rs1,250 (Rs1,150 earlier), based on 16x core Jun’24E EPS (DCF-based) and the value of investments at Rs482/share. We increase the valuation multiple to 16x from 14x, factoring in higher revenue growth and margin assumptions in our DCF model.

Auto stocks extended gains for yet another session on June 24, with the Nifty Auto index rising 2 percent as most shares witnessed a long build-up given the stability in metal prices that had raised concerns over margins.

The Auto index has done well in the charts, seeing the formation of higher highs and higher lows, particularly since the troughs witnessed in March, which appear to be its bottom this year.

The Nifty Auto index had gained 2 percent. TVS Motor Company and M&M gained 3.5 percent and 4.3 percent respectively, while Hero MotoCorp climbed over 3 percent on reports that the two-wheeler maker has decided to hike its motorcycles and scooters prices from July 1.Eicher Motors, and Maruti Suzuki jumped 2 percent and 1 percent respectively. Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors, and Bajaj Auto gained 0.2-0.8 percent, while auto ancillary companies such as Sona Comstar, MRF, and Bosch rose between 1-4 percent.

Tube Investments of India, the flagship company of the Murugappa group, was the biggest gainer, rising 4.9 percent as Motilal Oswal has initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating and a target price of Rs 1,900, implying 25 percent potential upside from Thursday's closing price.

“Tube Investments offers diversified revenue streams, with strong growth in the core business (around 25 percent CAGR), ramp-up in CG Power and optionality of new businesses incubated under TI-2 strategy. At the consolidated level, we estimate revenue, EBITDA, and PAT CAGR of around 15 percent, 20 percent, and 20 percent over FY22-25, respectively,” said the brokerage.

CAGR is compound annual growth rate. CG Power (formerly Crompton Greaves) was acquired in 2020. EBITDA stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. PAT is profit after tax.

The Nifty Auto index has gained 20 percent since its March lows, turning out to be the biggest gainer among all sectors, pricing in expected benefits of falling commodity prices, especially steel and aluminium, the key material for making vehicles, resulting in easing cost pressure.

“The automobile sector will also see benefits of cooling commodity prices like steel and aluminium. New steel contracts could get negotiated at a lower price which will help improve the margins. The chip shortage will also start to abate significantly in the forthcoming quarters, helping top OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) raise production,” said Naveen Kulkarni, chief investment officer at Axis Securities.

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley said volume outlook across segments is constructive and companies have taken price hikes but cost pressures are easing.

The global research house is overweight on Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, Tata Motors, M&M and Eicher Motors. “We are equal-weight on Bajaj Auto & Samvardhana Motherson, whereas we are underweight on Amara Raja Batteries, TVS Motor Company and Hero MotoCorp,” it said in a report.

The market went fully under the reign of bears and kept going down for the second week in a row. The benchmark indices hit a fresh 52-week low in the week ended June 17 as fears of a recession intensified after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by 75 bps in its June policy meeting and hinted another 50-75 bps hike in rates in the next policy meeting to control inflation.

The Nifty50 fell more than 900 points or 5.6 percent during the week to close at 15,293.5, the lowest closing level since May 25, 2021, taking two-week losses to nearly 8 percent and the correction of nearly 18 percent from record highs. All sectoral indices fell sharply and closed in the red.

The elevated volatility clearly favoured bears and the price trend also indicated nervousness on the street, but the sentiments indicator like Stochastic showed positive crossover, generally indicates a bit of possibility of recovery from lows. Hence, if the index shows any recovery then there could be resistance around 15,400-15,500 area, whereas it could get support around 15,200-15,000 levels, and breaking of which could create some panic in the market, experts said.

""Taking a glance at the weekly time frame chart, we can see prices sliding below '89-EMA' for the first time after July 2020. So, pricewise, it needs to be construed as a breakdown, does not augur well for the bulls. On the flipside, the Nifty is exactly placed at the previous breakout point of May 2021 which is around 15,400 – 15,300,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

In addition, he said the ‘RSI-Smoothened’ oscillator on the daily chart is showing a ‘positive divergence’ i.e. lower lows in recent prices and higher lows in the oscillator. This condition generally happens at the fag-end of any downtrend. Hence, looking at the charts, we are clearly in two minds at this juncture, the market expert feels.

As far as supports are concerned, 15,200–15,000 are to be seen as immediate supports and breach of the same, would certainly create some panic kind of situation in markets, Chavan said, adding on the flipside that the markets would regain the strength only after surpassing the key levels of 15,700–15,800 on a closing basis. Till then, it’s not advisable to carry aggressive longs overnight.

Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the June 17 closing prices:

Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 997.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 980 | Target: Rs 1,040-1,058 | Return: 4-6 percent

Over the past month, the stock has managed to surpass the all-time high of Rs 993. The stock is in throwback mode after hitting Rs 1,058 level, which usually happens to complete the pattern. The stock was down in the first half of the trading session on Friday, although it came back to Rs 997 in the second half, which is positive in the short term.

Depending on the formation, the stock could rebound towards Rs 1,040 or Rs 1,058 levels. However, we need to place a stop-loss at Rs 980 to protect the trading position in it.

Sun TV Network: Buy | LTP: Rs 433.05 | Stop-Loss: Rs 399 | Target: Rs 450-490 | Return: 4-13 percent

Since the last month, the stock is relatively outperforming the index and on Friday it has made a strong comeback from the lower boundary of the trading range. The stock is still in the trading range between Rs 400 and Rs 450.

Until the stock is not crossing the level of Rs 450, it would remain rangebound, however, while looking at the volume expansion, we could see the stock is climbing to Rs 450 level.

On the dismissal of the trading range on the upward side, the stock can gradually move to Rs 490-500 levels. The strategy should be to buy partly at current levels and balance 50 percent to buy around Rs 410 levels. Keep a stop-loss at Rs 399. On the higher side. the targets would be Rs 450 and Rs 490.

Jatin Gohil, Technical & Derivative Analyst at Reliance Securities

Indus Towers: Buy | LTP: Rs 208 | Stop-Loss: Rs 193 | Target: Rs 237 | Return: 14 percent

The stock advanced gradually post a trendline breakout. Its daily relative strength index (RSI) remained firm post an identical

trendline breakout, signaling strength in the stock.

On June 17, 2022, the stock rose to one-month high and outperformed the benchmark-Nifty. Spike in volume and rise in future open interest indicates that major market participants are in favour of the bulls, as risk reward is quite favorable for fresh long position at this juncture.

This could lead the stock towards Rs 226 initially and Rs 237 subsequently. In case of any decline, the stock will find support around Rs 197-193 zone.

Delta Corp: Buy | LTP: Rs 184.20 | Stop-Loss: Rs 162 | Target: Rs 240 | Return: 30 percent

After a higher level of reversal (i.e. 52 percent fall from its prior peak level of Rs 340), the stock tested its 61.8 percent

Fibonacci Retracement level of prior mega up-move (Rs 54-340), which was placed at Rs 163 and poised for a fresh up-move.

On June 17, 2022, the stock reversed from its 52-week low and breached its prior daily falling trend. The stock formed a Bullish Engulfing pattern on the daily timeframe chart. Its volume rose to multi-month high.

Its daily RSI reversed from the deep oversold zone (20-level) and after a bullish divergence, gave a buy signal.

This could take the stock towards Rs 220 initially and Rs 240 subsequently. On the lower side, its key Fibonacci retracement level will continue to work as a strong reversal point.

Sun TV Network: Buy | LTP: Rs 433.05 | Stop-Loss: Rs 404 | Target: Rs 500 | Return: 15.5 percent

After a rising channel breakdown, the stock tested its medium-term support zone and poised for an up-move. Since late-May 2022, the stock formed multiple bullish trend reversal patterns around that zone on weekly chart.

Its daily technical indicators reversed from the lower levels and are positively poised.

The stock has potential to move towards Rs 480 initially and Rs 500 subsequently. In case of any decline, its medium-term support zone will continue to restrict the fall.

Sacchitanand Uttekar, Vice-President - Research (Derivatives & Technicals) at Tradebulls Securities

Hero MotoCorp: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,467.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,610 | Target: Rs 2,200 | Return: 11 percent

Fresh breakdown on its daily scale from an inverse pennant formation is insync with its on-going weekly bearish trend. The recent ‘Bearish Engulfing’ pattern on its weekly scale reconfirmed the resistance around Rs 2700 zone; which should continue as a firm resistance going forward as the price is expected to revisit the Channel pattern support zone around Rs 2,200.

RSI too has confirmed the weakness as it exhibits a negative crossover at its 50 mark; indicating fresh directional momentum. Fresh short to continue with a stop-loss at Rs 2,610 for a target upto Rs 2,200.

Canara Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 180.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 188 | Target: Rs 166 | Return: 8 percent

Breakdown from a ‘Head & Shoulder’ formation with neckline being placed at Rs 210 now. The recent pullback witnessed exhaustion near the neckline as the trend reversed back to break below its 4 weeks of consolidation.

Trend strength indicator average directional index (ADX) on its weekly scale is about to break above its 25 mark, warranting directional momentum to aggravate further. Sell Canara Bank with a stop-loss above Rs 188 for a pattern target up to Rs 166.

Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking

Coromandel International: Buy | LTP: Rs 923.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 840 | Target: Rs 1,050 | Return: 14 percent

Coromandel is among the select few stocks which is not only showing resilience but also inching gradually higher despite the prevailing market trend. It has been consolidating in a range around its record high and is likely to resume the up move soon. We recommend utilizing this phase to accumulate fresh within Rs 890-920 levels.

IndusInd Bank June Futures: Sell | LTP: Rs 810 | Stop-Loss: Rs 870 | Target: Rs 725 | Return: 10.5 percent

IndusInd bank has been trading with the corrective bias, after its failed trend reversal attempt in November 2021. It has spent nearly 6 months in a broader range of Rs 810-950 and is now on the verge of a breakdown from the same. Traders can consider going short within the Rs 820-830 zone.

Mahanagar Gas June Futures: Sell | LTP: Rs 698.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 760 | Target: Rs 620 | Return: 11 percent

Most of the gas distribution stocks are reeling under pressure and MGL is trading in sync with the trend. It is currently trading around the crucial support zone of Rs 700 levels however the chart pattern indicates a strong possibility of a breakdown ahead. We thus recommend creating fresh shorts within the Rs 710-720 zone.

Utility vehicles maker Mahindra & Mahindra has clocked a massive 208 percent year-on-year growth in May, while the tractors segment registered a 48 percent growth over the year-ago period. The significant growth was largely due to low base as there were state-wise lockdowns to contain the Covid pandemic last year.

Auto sales for May 2022 stood at 53,726 vehicles, up from 17,447 vehicles sold a year back.

In the utility vehicles segment, Mahindra said it sold 26,632 vehicles in May, up 244 percent over the same month last year. Passenger vehicles segment, including utility vehicle, cars and vans, sold 26,904 units in May 2022, posting a 236 percent on-year growth.

""We are witnessing strong bookings and have a robust pipeline. We announced the launch of Scorpio-N, which is generating very high interest levels and promises to be yet another blockbuster from Mahindra,"" Veejay Nakra, President, Automotive Division, M&M said.

Mahindra's Farm Equipment Segment

The company sold 35,722 tractors in May 2022, registering a 48 percent growth compared to 24,184 units sold in same month previous year, supported by low base.

""Domestic sales in May 2022 were at 34,153 units, as against 22,843 units during May 2021, while exports for the month stood at 1,569 units against 1,341 units in corresponding month last year,"" M&M said.

""The 50 percent growth in domestic business is on the back of 51 percent growth achieved in the month of April 2022,"" Hemant Sikka, President - Farm Equipment Sector said.

"May 27, 2022 05:24 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/automakers-on-suv-rollout-spree-as-buyers-dump-hatchbacks-sedans-8585061.html,"India’s top automakers such as Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motor India, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), etc., are poised to introduce a range of sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in the next six to nine months to meet growing aspirational demand for this category of cars.

Eight new SUV models were launched in the mass segment this year and nine more are on the anvil in the next calendar year, according to auto intelligence firm JATO Dynamics. Models launched recently include Tata Punch, Mahindra XUV700, Skoda Kushaq and Volkswagen Taigun.

Personal mobility demand in India has been increasing and SUV sales have grown in the past five years, even during the pandemic, as prospective buyers increasingly spurn hatchbacks and sedans. Experts said this trend will continue the coming years as customers aspire for SUVs, which are sturdy and spacious and offer superior driving dynamics, offroad capability, and safety features.

Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL), the market leader, is said to be launching a new Vitara Brezza in the second quarter of 2022. The company will likely introduce a mid-size SUV, being developed jointly with Toyota, in the third quarter of 2022 to take on the Hyundai Creta and Kia Seltos, people aware of the company’s plans said.

“Although we cannot talk about our future product plans, what I can indicate is there will be quite a few launches in the SUV segment straddling across multiple price points,” said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director for marketing and sales at Maruti Suzuki.

Fuel factor

Srivastava said the cost of running a vehicle is an extremely important factor in India’s market, irrespective of the segment. Car manufacturers have to focus on fuel efficiency if the true potential of SUV demand is to be realized, he said.

“Fuel efficiency is going to play a very important role in SUV demand, especially with the high fuel prices prevalent today,” Srivastava said.

His thoughts are seconded by Nissan Motor India MD Rakesh Srivasatava (also former Hyundai India Sales and Marketing head), who believes that the cost of ownership is calculated by various factors including cost of maintenance, amongst other factors.

In his words, “The overall cost of ownership has gone up for the industry, owing to factors including the rise in fuel prices, however, considering now that we have organized sectors for selling used cars, the consumers are better off.”

Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) is gearing up to roll out a new version of its Venue by next June. It will introduce the fourth-generation Tucson during the second half of the calendar year, which will be positioned above the Alcazar in its SUV portfolio and will be pitted against models such as the Jeep Compass, Citroen C5 Aircross, MG Hector, Tata Harrier, MG XUV700, and Volkswagen Tiguan.

Mahindra & Mahindra recently revealed the name of its much-awaited SUV that was codenamed Z101 as the Scorpio-N. The Mumbai-based company said the existing Scorpio model will continue as the Scorpio Classic. M&M plans to introduce 13 SUVs by 2027, expecting the market share of this category of vehicles to remain healthy even with the entry of electric vehicles.

“In a post-Covid world, people either individually or in groups want to reboot their lives and a big way is venturing out to the great outdoors for which SUVs are the natural choice,” said Veejay Nakra, president of M&M’s automotive division. “With this increasing trend of tourism with road travel, we have seen an increase in customers buying an SUV as their first vehicle.”

Honda Cars India Limited (HCIL) also plans to launch an India-specific SUV by next year. ""We are very confident that the new model will be well accepted by our customers in the same way as our strong models City and Amaze are doing in the sedan market,” says Yuichi Murata, Director, Marketing and Sales, HCIL.

Tata Motors, which launched a series of SUVs in 2021, is set to expand its range. While one of them is said to be the Tata Blackbird, which is being positioned as a premium, midsize coupe SUV, the other is likely to be the midsize SUV Sierra EV, whose concept version was unveiled at the 2020 Auto Expo. The company’s Safari SUV may also get a petrol variant. The company spokesperson, when contacted, maintained that it will share details closer to launch.

India’s SUV market has grown at a faster pace than the industry average and this category accounted for 50 percent of passenger vehicle sales in FY22 compared with 21 percent in 2015, according to industry estimates. SUV sales increased 12 percent in FY22, while sales of other passenger vehicles fell 2 percent.

Consumer preferences

Demand for SUVs has remained strong even in the midst of disruptions caused by two waves of Covid-19, the semiconductor crisis, skyrocketing fuel prices and a steep increase in commodity prices.

“This indicates a strong shift in customer preference to SUVs from other body types,” said Nakra of M&M, which brought in utility vehicles such as the Bolero and Scorpio more than two decades ago. “Demand continues to be strong for SUVs in both rural and urban markets.”

Nakra said there is pent-up SUV demand, which the auto industry has not been able to meet because of supply-chain disruptions and the global semiconductor shortage. He said while rising fuel prices may have some impact on utilisation of SUVs, the need to own a personal SUV remains strong.

About 10.60 lakh SUVs were sold in India in FY22 compared with about 639,000 units in FY18, according to TechSci Research. The volumes were quite close to the hatchback segment at 11 lakh units . (See table below)

Volume (Lakh Units) FY2018 FY2022 CAGR (FY2018-FY2022) Hatchback 15.72 11.00 -8.54% Sedan 6.39 3.67 -12.96% SUV 6.39 10.60 13.48% MPV 5.98 4.30 -7.95%

Model launches and availability have been key factors driving SUV sales. The number of small car models in the market has remained at 26-27 since FY10, while the model count in utility vehicles increased to 58 in FY22 from 36 in FY10, according to Crisil.

Its research estimates that the employee cost of large and medium companies – a proxy for income sentiment among affluent buyers of higher-priced cars – increased by 20-25 percent since FY19, faster than the 0-10 percent in small and medium-sized companies, which typically account for a larger proportion of lower-priced car buyers.

According to Pushan Sharma, director of Crisil Research, first-time buyers, too, prefer to buy a used utility vehicle than spend an equivalent amount on similar-priced small cars. He added that even the price increases of SUVs have been comparatively lower.

“Price hikes for SUVs didn’t dampen buyer sentiment as their income had been stable during the pandemic, unlike the small car buyers, who have seen a significant impact on income amid the pandemic,” Sharma said.

Karan Chechi, director of TechSci Research, said long-distance travel is more comfortable in an SUV than in a hatchback or sedan because they are more spacious and have better ground clearance.

“A lot of advanced safety features like terrain response system, hill start assist, hill descent control, and dynamic stability control have contributed to this shift in preferences,” Chechi said.

Going electric

TechSci Research said the SUV segment is set to grow at about 10 percent in each of the next five years. JATO Dynamics is of the view that SUV sales are expected to increase at about 9 percent in each of the next seven years to exceed 2.16 million units by 2028.

A new trend in India’s SUV market is the increasing adoption of electric vehicles such as Mercedes Benz EQC, Hyundai Kona Electric, MG ZS EV, and Tata Nexon.

According to TechSci Research, Tata Motors sold 15,198 electric passenger cars in FY22, with the Nexon accounting for about 94 percent of sales. MG sold 2,045 units of its ZS EV last year.

“The growth of SUVs in the forecast years is attributed to the increasing portfolio of electric SUVs, improving lifestyle of consumers, growing interest in weekend traveling, advanced safety features, and enhanced comfort,” Chechi from TechSci Research said."
"May 19, 2022 07:40 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/what-does-mahindras-new-deal-with-vw-mean-for-the-ev-ecosystem-8540801.html,"One of the key reasons VW created the open, customisable EV platform is to help brands and countries meet the terms of the Paris climate change agreement.

It’s a different take on plug and play. With the global unveiling of Mahindra & Mahindra’s “Born Electric” platform scheduled for July, the utility vehicle giant has signed an agreement with Volkswagen AG to source components such as electric motors and battery cells from the latter’s highly reputed MEB or modular electric drive matrix architecture. This is part of a bid to aid the rapid electrification of the country’s automotive sector in accordance with India’s “100% zero-emission from vehicles” goal by 2035.

According to Thomas Schmall, CEO of Volkswagen Group Components, “the MEB (platform) is both technologically state of the art and highly competitive in terms of cost. The MEB is thus progressively developing into the leading open platform for e-mobility, generating significant volume and economies of scale.”

What is the MEB platform all about?

MEB is essentially an open-vehicle, skateboard platform for electric vehicles (EVs) designed and developed by VW. While it’s currently being used to produce EVs for all VW subsidiaries (Skoda Auto, Seat, Audi, etc), the modular platform has been created to be adaptable by third-party brands that can use it to mass-produce safe and cost-effective EVs without having to go through years of R&D to manufacture their own platform. Translated from the German, MEB stands for “Modular Electric Toolkit”.

Mahindra & Mahindra isn’t the only one to collaborate with the Wolfsburg, Germany-based company. Earlier this year, Ford Motor signed an agreement with the VW Group to produce an electric model for the European market based on the MEB platform. One of the key reasons is that the MEB platform allows manufacturers to scale up their EV production in record time. With the deal, Ford will manage to “double its planned MEB volume to 1.2 million units over a six-year timeframe”, according to an official press statement released by the Volkswagen Group. According to VW, it’s also a platform that can help EV startups get a running start in the business. In fact, its first partnership was with a small German EV maker called e.Go, which is currently using the platform to make EVs designed for urban environments. But given its modular nature, the platform can accommodate individual battery systems that can be used based on the nature and requirements of the EV.

The modular platform has been created to be adaptable by third-party brands that can use it to mass-produce safe and cost-effective EVs

VW launched the MEB platform in 2016, prior to which all its EVs were based on its internal combustion engine (ICE) car platforms, much like the Tata Nexon EV is based on the Tata Nexon—an EV powertrain retrofitted to an ICE chassis. However, using a conventional ICE platform limits the scope in terms of design and ability to offer change, with several fixed components like the engine bay, etc, not allowing for a lot of room for innovation.

The layout is fairly simple: an electric motor integrated in the rear axle, which includes power electronics and transmission, while auxiliary units are located in the front. For a modular skateboard platform like MEB, you get a much larger passenger cell, with all battery cells stored in the thick floor. You also get much shorter overhangs, given there is no ICE to take space. By sharing parts like the motor, suspension, steering mechanism, axles, etc, Mahindra & Mahindra will be able to pump out EVs at a much larger scale in a much shorter span. (Tata Motors recently unveiled a prototype of an EV skateboard platform it developed in-house that underpins the Avinya concept car, the production version of which is expected in early 2024.)

One of the key reasons VW created the open, customisable EV platform is to help brands and countries meet the terms of the Paris climate change agreement. For the Indian market, it is good news as it will enable Mahindra to become a player that can help populate and further popularise EVs in a market that is still adapting to it at a much slower pace than many other markets. Till the time Mahindra starts local manufacture of battery cells, the MEB-led partnership is its best bet to give competition to brands like Tata Motors in the EV segment."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M’s EBITDA margin at 11.9% (PLe: 12.3%) contracted 60bps QoQ owing to commodity cost pressues, chip supply issues and weak product mix. Tractor segment’s EBIT margin was at 17.3% (-140bps QoQ), while auto business posted EBIT margins of ~3.7%. Company is experiencing good traction in automotive segment, with an order book of ~155k units (~70k units for XUV700). However, unprecedented demand for new models and semiconductor shortage is causing longer waiting periods. Management highlighted that Feb-22 has seen chip shortage issue easing out and it has worked out strategies for its alternative multi-sourcing. However, tractor business is entering a cyclical slowdown and is expected to remain under pressure in coming quarters. Management also targets to bring down cost base by ~300bps, thus aiding the margin profile.

Outlook

We remain positive on M&M’s growth prospects as (1) automotive segment will benefit from strong product pipeline, strong order book and easing supply issues (2) market leader will benefit from gainig traction in farm implements space and (3) better product mix, benign commodity environment and price hikes will lead to margin improvments. We increase our FY23/24 EPS by 3/4% to factor in volume growth and cost control initiatives. Maintain ‘BUY’ at a TP of Rs 1,015 (at 18x core business).

Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel One

The markets saw an action-packed week ended February 11 with massive whipsaw movements amid mixed global cues. The market started on a weaker note that further aggravated as a broad-based sell-off happened in the initial half of the week.

In the process, the market plunged heavily with the benchmark Nifty50 almost testing the psychological 17,000 mark. However, a sort of recovery was seen in the mid-session, where the bulls managed to defend the crucial support zone of 17,000 amid optimism in selective blue chips and extended rallies towards the 17,650-odd zone. On Friday, the market tumbled from the highs owing to concerns over the US rate hike and corrected to end the week on a negative note.

Till the time, the global uncertainty looms over, we are likely to have challenging scenarios in the market where the volatility is also expected to stay on the higher end. On technical aspects, 17,000 is expected to act as the key demand zone as it is being backed by the supporting trend line.

And till the market is holding the mark, we remain hopeful for a strong resurgence. On the higher end, 17,650 is a crucial supply area and if the market manages to surpass the same in a decisive manner, then we might witness reinforcement in the momentum and could expect Nifty to test the psychological 18,000 mark in the near future.

Until the decisive breakout is not seen, one should expect a rangebound movement and focus on stock-specific action.

Apart from the global cues that might dictate the near-term trend, strong leadership from major sectors could help to gain momentum in the domestic market.

Going forward, looking at the technical structure and the sentiments among the market participants, indecisiveness could be sensed as the range is getting narrower over the period. Meanwhile, we might witness some outbursts in the near term, and hence stock selective approach should be taken in the market for the coming week.

Here are two buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 853.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 815 | Target: Rs 910 | Return: 6.6 percent

This stock has seen a significant up move in the last week and was among the outperformers from the auto space. The stock has witnessed a strong resurgence from the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) on the daily chart that has been backed by robust volumes.

With the current setup, the counter looks firmly poised to surge high in the near term. Even the recent price action indicates the possibility of unfolding the next leg of the rally to test the immediate swing high.

We recommend buying this stock for a trading target of Rs 910. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 815.

BSE: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,271.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,100 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 10 percent

BSE Limited has been in a secular uptrend and is comfortably hovering above all its exponential moving averages on the daily chart. In the previous week, the stock has witnessed a volume-based trendline breakout maintaining its bullish view.

The overall structure construes to remain bullish biased in the counter, and the recent traction indicates the potential to enter the unchartered territory in the near term.

Hence, short-term investors can look to accumulate on minor dips for a near-term target of Rs 2,500. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 2,100.

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) shares traded in the green in the morning session on February 11 but slipped into the red amid weak market conditions over global macro concerns.

The stock was trading at Rs 839.05, down Rs 14.05, or 1.65 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 861.90 and an intraday low of Rs 835.65.

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd, including its manufacturing arm Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturing, posted a net profit of Rs 2,484.24 crore after exceptional items. This was a sharp 57 percent surge from Rs 1,268 crore reported a year ago, the company said on February 10.

Revenue for the quarter rose 9 percent from a year ago to Rs 2,3594 crore. Tractor sales in the domestic market fell 9 percent on-year to 91,769 units. Sales in the auto segment, including commercial and passenger vehicles, dropped 2 per cent to 11,8174 units during the period.

The company said its margin stood at 11.9 percent which was impacted due to commodity inflation and shortage of semiconductors. The company said that during the quarter it saw continued growth in exports both for the auto and farm segment at 58.3 percent year-on-year.

The company said its auto business continued to register a strong booking pipeline for its key models. The launch of XUV700 saw overwhelming response with over one lakh bookings in four months. Its tractor market share in the quarter was up 1.4 percent to 39.4 percent.

Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd on Thursday said it has clocked almost one lakh bookings of its latest sports utility vehicle XUV700 besides billing the first 14,000 units of the vehicle by January, despite global supply chain issues.

The company in a statement also said that while the dynamic supply chain issues continue to be a challenge in streamlining and ramping up production, it is doing its best and focusing on meeting its committed delivery timelines to customers.

Given the unprecedented bookings and the continued strong demand for the vehicle, the waiting period for most variants stands at 6-10 months. However, the AX7 series has a waiting period of well over 12 months, it stated.

The homegrown auto major had launched XUV700 in August last and opened bookings from early October. The deliveries of the XUV700, however, commenced only from October 30.

Priced between Rs 12.95 lakh and Rs 23.79 lakh (ex-showroom), the five- and seven-seater XUV700 comes in two broad trims MX and AX (AdrenoX). AX (AdrenoX) is further divided into three sub-trims AX3, AX5, and AX7. AX (AdrenoX) is further divided into three sub-trims AX3, AX5, and AX7.

""Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd has met its commitment of billing the first 14,000 XUV700s by January 2022. The SUV has clocked almost 1,00,000 bookings since its commencement on October 7,"" the company said.

Upon completion, it will be the fastest for an SUV to reach the one-lakh booking milestone in India, M&M Ltd said. Mahindra has delivered on its commitment of billing 14,000 SUV700 in less than 90 days, the company said in a statement.

Homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) on January 1 reported a 19 percent decline in total tractor sales at 18,269 units in December 2021.

The company had sold 22,417 units in the same month of 2020, M&M said in a statement.

Domestic tractor sales were at 16,687 units last month as compared to 21,173 units in December 2020, down 21 percent.

Exports, on the other hand, grew 27 percent to 1,582 units against 1,244 units in December 2020, the company said.

Commenting on the performance, M&M President - Farm Equipment Sector, Hemant Sikka said the de-growth in December has been on account of a combination of factors, including the high base of last year and both delayed and very heavy rainfall in some geographies.

''We expect momentum to recover in the coming months on account of the good progress of Kharif procurement, bringing liquidity in the hands of farmers and Rabi acreage showing signs of growth over last year,'' he added."

“With volumes, prices can come down,” he said.

“Design can make this a really cool vehicle. When I drive my auto on rural roads, people ask me where to get one.”

The Zoho chief urged Anand Mahindra to introduce the three-wheeler in different designs and colours, with family and child-friendly options.

Motilal Oswal's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

The beat in MM's 2QFY22 performance was driven by better mix in the Auto business, cost-saving initiatives, and higher other income. Growth in Tractors is slowing, particularly on a high base of FY21. However, the Auto segment is expected to see strong momentum in both SUVs (led by new products and the easing of supply issues) and LCVs (cyclical recovery) We increase our FY22E/FY23E EPS estimate by 9%/8% to factor in stronger than expected XUV700 response as well as an improving LCV cycle. We maintain our Buy rating, with a TP of INR1,150/share (Sep'23E SoTP).

Outlook

Implied core P/E for MM stands at 12.3x/9.6x FY22E/FY23E EPS. This implies an over 30% discount (on an FY23E basis) to its five-year average core P/E. We maintain our Buy rating, with a TP of INR1,150/share (Sep'23E SoTP).

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M posted a decent operating performance amidst challenging RM scenario. 2QFY22 EBITDA margin came below our estimates and impacted raw material inflation as well as weak mix. Despite sharp price hikes taken by the company, tractor segment’s EBIT margin came in at 18.7% (-570/-160bps YoY/qoq) while automotive segment was at 2.7% (-380/+100bps YoY/Qoq). However, new product launches in automotive segment are seeing good traction with ~70k+ bookings for XUV700 and overall orderbook of ~160k units. Management mentioned that due to erratic monsoons, price hikes and higher base tractor demand is seeing some moderation and expect flat to low single digit growth in FY22. Thus focus is on farm machinery segment with an intention to make it ~10x by FY27. We continue to remain positive considering 1) baton of growth shifting from tractor to automotives gaining traction in Farm machinery businss 2) strong product pipeline in UVs and tractors to help outperform industry and 3) improved captial allocation to improve return matrix.

Outlook

We increase FY23/24 EPS by 1%/ 4% to factor in volume growth and cost control initiatives. Maintain ‘BUY’ with revised SoTP based TP of Rs 1,061 (v/s Rs978), built on target multiple of 18x for core business (unchanged).

Emkay Global Financial's report on Mahindra and Mahindra

Q2FY22 EBITDA declined 19% yoy to Rs16.6bn, slightly above estimates. Revenue grew 15% to Rs133.1bn, above our estimate of Rs124.6bn, mainly aided by better realizations in the Auto segment. Adjusted earnings grew 29% to Rs16.9bn, 13% above estimates, owing to higher other income. The PV order book is strong at 160,000+ units, led by robust demand for XUV700 and Thar models. New products remain a focus area across segments, with an emphasis on EVs. By CY27, management expects to launch 16 electric models for PVs, CVs and 3Ws. We expect revenue/earnings CAGRs of 12%/14% over FY22-24E. Auto revenue should see a strong 18% CAGR, while Farm equipment revenues are likely to witness a subdued 2% CAGR.

Outlook

The core P/E ratio is inexpensive at 12.5x/10.5x on FY23/24 estimates. Recommend Buy with a TP of Rs1,055 (Rs920 earlier), based on 14x core P/E on Dec'23E (Sep'23E earlier) and the value of investments at Rs537/share (Rs435 earlier).

Automobile and tractor maker Mahindra and Mahindra on November 9 reported a 214 percent year-on-year growth in profit at Rs 1,929 crore for the quarter ended September 2021 due to a low base but the operating performance was hit by higher input prices.

The results include the numbers for Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers Limited, its commercial vehicle segment.

In Q2FY21, profit was hit by impairment losses.

""Commodity prices have impacted our margins in both the auto and farm business but our focus on cost management and optimisation has helped mitigate some of the impact,"" Group Chief Financial Officer Manoj Bhat said.

Revenue from operations grew by 14.8 percent year-on-year to Rs 13,305 crore, beating CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of Rs 12,348 crore for the September 2021 quarter.

""We have very healthy booking pipeline and buoyant demand for the company's products in the automotive segment. Global shortage of semi-conductors has impacted the production and sales for another quarter,"" M&M said.

In the case of farm equipment, ""farm business delivered an excellent performance with second-highest Q2 in terms of PBIT (profit before interest and tax), domestic volumes, and export volumes. We have a healthy growth of 1.9 percent in market share for M&M,"" it added.

In the automobile segment, Mahindra & Mahindra sold 99,334 vehicles during the quarter, increasing 9 percent YoY but tractor sales fell 5 percent YoY to Rs 88,920 crore.

The bulls are roaring, helping the benchmark indices to hit historic highs and maintain the uptrend for the fifth consecutive week as of September 24.

The BSE Sensex decisively surpassed the 60,000 mark and the Nifty 50 drew closer to 18,000. However, a similar momentum was absent in the broader markets, as the BSE MidCap Index gained 0.59 percent and the SmallCap Index rose 0.06 percent.

Both the benchmark indices closed at a record. The BSE Sensex jumped 1,032.58 points, or 1.75 percent, to 60,048.47 during the week and the Nifty 50 climbed 268.05 points, or 1.52 percent, to 17,853.20.

Given the significant rally over the past one month, experts suggest that investors book timely profits and avoid aggressive buying. According to them, the next resistance on the Nifty 50 is expected at 18,000, with support at 17,600.

“Our markets had a remarkable comeback in the last four sessions as we not only managed to recover from lows but also went on to clock fresh highs,” said Sameet Chavan, chief analyst – technical and derivatives, at Angel Broking. “We have clearly outperformed global peers because despite a relief move in last two days, they are still trading well below their highs.”

He said the recovery beyond 17,600 was certainly surprising but the market was superior.

“Ideally, after the market surpassed previous highs, our cautious stance should have been negated, but there are a few time-wise projections as well as negative divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI)-smoothened oscillator, clearly holding us back,” he said.

As far as levels are concerned, every 100 points from here can be seen as an immediate resistance, i.e., 17,900-18,000. On the flipside, 17,700-17,650 are to be seen as key supports, Chavan said.

He advised traders to continue with a stock-specific approach but keep booking timely profits and avoid carrying aggressive overnight bets. Meanwhile, all eyes are on the global markets and on how the banking index, which could probably decide the next path of action for the markets, he said.

Here are 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on September 24 closing prices:

TThis stock had been consolidating for five to six months without any real momentum. However, the price suddenly took off after surpassing its sturdy wall of Rs 890. This move was accompanied with sizable volumes, providing credence to the move.

Pricewise, the daily chart now exhibits a bullish cup and handle pattern and we expect a decent move in this stock in the forthcoming week.

We recommend buying on a decline towards Rs 890-880 for a short-term target of Rs 960. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 853.

ONGC: Buy | CMP: Rs 136.10 | Stop Loss: Rs 129.80 | Target: Rs 149 | Return: 9.5 percent

This Maharatna company failed to live up to expectations for the past seven years. Even in the ongoing bull run, it did not participate much. But now, with crude oil prices trading at a three-year high, ONGC is showing some strength.

Last week, ONGC shares surpassed the key 200-day simple moving average on the weekly timeframe chart for the first time since May 2019. In addition, the average directional index (14) indicator has started displaying an upward trajectory. One can look to buy this stock for a near-term target of Rs 149. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 129.80.

After moving in a narrow high-low range for the past few weeks as per the weekly timeframe chart, the fertilizer stock showed an upside breakout at Rs 58.50 on September 24. The larger degree higher tops and bottoms are intact and the present upward move could be in line with the expected new higher top formation.

The stock price is currently placed above the hurdle of the 10- and 20-week exponential moving average at about Rs 59. Hence, a sustainable move above this area could open a sharp upside momentum in the stock price. Buying can be initiated in NFL at Rs 60, add more on dips to Rs 57, wait for the upside target of Rs 67 in the next three to four weeks, and place a stop-loss of Rs 55.

The Phoenix Mills: Buy | CMP: Rs 945.50 | Stop Loss: Rs 880 | Target: Rs 1,060 | Return: 12.1 percent

This realty stock witnessed a sharp upside breakout of the larger consolidation pattern on the weekly timeframe chart at Rs 900 and closed higher. The formation of consistent higher bottoms, as per the weekly timeframe chart, signals the intact medium-term uptrend in the price. Volumes expanded during the upside breakout and the weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication.

One may look to buy The Phoenix Mills at the current market price, add more on dips to Rs 910 and wait for the target of Rs 1,060 in the next three to four weeks. Place a stop-loss of Rs 880.

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | CMP: 779.45 | Stop Loss: Rs 750 | Target: Rs 850 | Return: 9.1 percent

The auto index made a strong comeback in the previous week after hitting the 200-day SMA support level. M&M made an exceptional recovery after hitting the lower boundary of the current trading range of Rs 740-Rs 850.

Technically, it seems the stock has formed a higher bottom at Rs 740 and is heading for the upward boundary, which is at Rs 850, with major resistance at Rs 790, where it has the hurdle of the 200-day SMA. Buy at current levels and add more on dips with a final stop-loss at Rs 750.

LIC Housing Finance: Buy | CMP: Rs 429.25 | Stop Loss: Rs 420 | Target: Rs 470 | Return: 9.5 percent

LIC Housing has decisively crossed the swing high at Rs 429 with a rise in volumes. After two months, the stock closed above the 200-day SMA, which is positive for the medium term. Reality stocks are rallying and that would help housing finance companies in the near term.

Sun Pharma: Buy | CMP: Rs 770.45 | Stop Loss: Rs 730 | Target: Rs 870 | Return: 12.9 percent

Technically, the stock is forming a symmetrical triangle. It has a bullish consolidation after rallying to Rs 804 from Rs 650. It is the biggest outperforming stock in the pharma basket and should be bought at current levels and more on dips to about Rs 750.

Protect long positions with a final stop loss at Rs 730. On the higher side, Rs 800 and Rs 830 would be major hurdles.

Ashis Biswas, head of technical research at CapitalVia Global Research

HDFC Bank: Buy | CMP: Rs 1,601.55 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,520 | Target: Rs 1,720 | Return: 7.4 percent

The stock has been following an uptrend. We have observed a major breakout above Rs 1,600. Indicators like the MACD (moving average convergence/divergence) and RSI suggest the momentum in the stock is likely to continue. We recommend a buy in HDFC Bank above Rs 1,605 with a target of Rs 1,720. Investors are advised to maintain a stop-loss of Rs 1,520.

HPCL: Buy | CMP: Rs 274.80 | Stop Loss: Rs 244 | Target: Rs 300 | Return: 9.2 percent

HPCL has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern. We expect a bullish movement in the stock from the support and the momentum to continue. It has taken support at the 200 DMA line. We recommend a buy above Rs 276 with a target of Rs 300 and a stop-loss of Rs 244 for a medium-term perspective.

JB Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals: Buy | CMP: Rs 1,835.80 | Target: Rs 2,050 | Return: 11.7 percent

The stock has reversed from near the support of the 100 DMA. We have observed a breakout from the cup and handle formation above Rs 1,800. We recommend a buy above Rs 1,840 with a target of Rs 2,050 and a stop-loss of Rs 1,695 for a medium-term perspective.

M&M’s Q4FY2021 results were slightly below expectations due to lower EBITDA margin than estimates. Adjusted standalone PAT grew strongly by 189.8% y-o-y to Rs. 935. We firmly believe M&M is on a right track with its roadmap for its automotive and farm equipment division. Moreover, M&M is expected to benefit from the turnaround of its loss-making subsidiaries and generate strong cash flows going forward. The stock is attractively valued at a P/E multiple of 16.6x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.2x its FY2023E estimates.

The company on May 28 reported profit before exceptional item at Rs 1,002 crore in the quarter ended March 2021 against Rs 323 crore in the year-ago quarter on the back of improvement in demand for passenger vehicles and tractors.

The net profit after exceptional item stood at Rs 163 crore against a loss of Rs 3,255 crore in the same period last year. The massive loss of Rs 3,255 crore in March 2020 was due to the write down of investment in Ssangyong and other international subsidiaries.

Automotive business registered a 42.7 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 7,858.1 crore in Q4FY21. At the operating level, the segment reported a 73.1 percent growth in EBIT at Rs 390 crore with the margin improving 90 bps YoY to 5 percent during the quarter.

However, the auto maker expects it will take at least another two years for car sales to return to their pre-pandemic peak but a slow pace of vaccinations could hurt recovery prospects, its chief told Reuters in an interview.

Mahindra Chief Executive Officer Anish Shah said sales would rebound by the fiscal year 2023 if a majority of the country's population is inoculated and new COVID-19 cases ease, helping the economy recover.

""Getting back to full normal is going to depend on vaccinations ... (else) we will always have the fear of the next wave coming in and disrupting things again,"" Shah said.

Shah expects the pace of vaccinations in India to pick up in June but said if that does not happen it would be a concern

""It is about reaching a certain point where we don't have to get into lockdowns once more,"" he said. ""If that happens, we will continue to be in this phase of two steps ahead and one step back.""

According to Sharekhan, EBITDA margin could improve by 207 bps YoY driven by higher share of tractors, where M&M makes higher margins versus its automobile segment."

The coronavirus pandemic has been putting a lot of new car launches on hold with the second wave affecting the country worse than the first. The latest victim of this ‘postpone culture’ is the Mahindra Scorpio.

According to a Team-BHP report, the launch next generation of Mahindra Scorpio SUVs has now been pushed to as far ahead as February 2022. Of course spy pictures and videos of the upcoming SUV has been doing the rounds of the internet for quite a while and we believed it was to be launched towards the festive season of this year.

The Mahindra Scorpio will undergo some evolutionary changes on the design front such as the longer bonnet we have spied on test mules. The grille also seems to have been tweaked a little while the headlamps look like they will be projector units. The test mules also look slightly larger than the current-gen Scorpio which means slightly more cabin space.

Speaking of the cabin, there should be some significant changes here too. We are expecting a new dashboard along with a digital instrument cluster, a large touchscreen infotainment system, premium upholstery and even a front-facing third row of seats.

The Scoprio is expected to be powered by the same engine options that are available on the Mahindra Thar – the 2.0-litre mStallion petrol and the 2.2-litre mHawk diesel. Transmission options too should include a 6-speed manual as well as an automatic.

In terms of pricing, we don’t expect much of a change. A range of Rs 12 lakh to Rs 18 lakh can still be expected. Rivals include the likes of the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Nissan Kicks and even the Renault Duster."

Mahindra and Mahindra will keep away from the sedan segment, said the CEO of the company’s Automotive sector, Veejay Nakra, In an interview with Youtube channel Powerdrif.

Mahindra and Mahindra, for the majority of its years, is known as the SUV manufacturer of legend. But, there was one sedan out there from the company’s stables.

Mahindra has been known for its SUVs - legendary cars like the Mahindra Thar and the more modern but long-running vehicles like the Bolero and Scorpio dominate Mahindra’s lineup. There was a time, however, when Mahindra had joined hands with Renault to bring in the Logan. That partnership ended however and Mahindra began rebadging the car as the Verito which is still sold in EV form for the fleet purposes.

This was and probably will be the last of the Mahindra sedans.

“Never say never, but we are clear we are not going to make sedans,” Nakra said when asked if there were going to be cars in any other segments.

The Mahindra Thar has been doing fairly well in the market, and the company does not want to lose focus on what they are specialists in – SUVs.

As for the future, the long awaited XUV500 is also in the works and will be launched somewhere between Q2 and Q3 of 2021."

""That team was not going to be doing the development work that was at the concept stage. So, it is really around that and has nothing to do with the tractor business,"" he added.

When asked if there are possibilities for further job cuts in the North American unit ahead of the planned launch of the off-roader Roxor, Jejurikar said, ""We just got approval for the new Roxor model. We are working on a relaunch approach, details not finalised but we may go for much more digital and there may hence be some manpower restructuring beyond what has already happened because there was no production really happening in the last few months.""

He said the relaunch of the new Roxor will take a few more months without sharing a definite timeline. ""We will then be working on what exactly is the right resourcing for the launch. Manpower number is not finalised,"" he said.

M&M Deputy Managing Director and Group CFO Anish Shah said the company has also rationalised manpower at engineering services of the Italian unit Pininfarina as it had ""excess count compared to what the market demand was"".

Mahindra & Mahindra, the utility vehicle and tractor maker, is expected to show more than 50 percent year-on-year growth in profit for the quarter ended December 2020 driven by operating income and dividend from a group company.

The likely revenue growth of over 15 percent could be driven by tractor volumes and increase in realisation, brokerages feel.

Overall volumes increased by 3 percent year-on-year in Q3FY21 led by 20 percent YoY increase in tractor volumes, though automobile volumes fell by 8 percent YoY.

""We expect revenues to increase by 17 percent YoY led by 13 percent YoY increase in average selling prices (ASPs) and 3 percent YoY increase in volumes in Q3FY21,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities.

Price hikes and favourable product mix is expected to increase average realisation in Q3FY21, Sharekhan feels.

Kotak expects profit to increase by 93 percent YoY due to 38 percent YoY increase in EBITDA and higher other income due to special dividend paid by Tech Mahindra during the quarter, while Sharekhan sees a massive 78 percent YoY growth in profit.

The EBITDA growth is likely to be driven by a richer product mix (higher mix of tractor segment) and cost-reduction efforts, partly offset by increase in input cost in Q3FY21, said the brokerage, adding margin may expand by 271 bps YoY.

According to Sharekhan, EBITDA margin could improve by 304 bps driven by higher share of tractors, where M&M makes higher margins versus its automobile segment."

In conversation with Bloomberg, Managing Director Anish Shah said authorities can help in the realm of cost parity, however, it remains difficult for the government to justify subsidising cars for the rich.

“In three to five years’ time, we will have modern electric platforms in India” and cars with internal combustion engines will start to be phased out, Shah said, adding that it is in 2030 that the automaker sees a tipping point where electric vehicles could potentially take over ICE engines in terms of sales.

As for now, Mahindra is placing its focus on larger sports utility vehicles and pickup trucks, which is a reasonably large segment to drive sales according to Shah.

The automaker recently launched Thar, which scored a solid four stars in adult and child safety Global NCAP’s latest round of crash tests."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

We believe the decision of calling off JV between MM and Ford is positive given very limited scope for new product development along with sourcing related synergies (Click here for our earlier report on MM-Ford JV). In fact, amount saved from not investing (envisaged to be Rs14bn) can now be better utilized in their SUV and EV segment. On the other hand, with SsangYong (SYMC) now under ARS, MM is confident to strike a deal with potential investor by Feb end. We are assertive on MM as management has again reinforced investors that capital allocation remains the key focus (target RoE of >18). On the auto side, MM plans to sharpen focus on its core SUV products and succeed in establishing a strong presence in EV as well. We expect farm and UV segment volumes to grow at ~5% and 9% CAGR over FY21-23E led by new launches. We also built in EBITDA/PAT CAGR of ~9%/12% over FY21-23E. M&M+MVML margins expected to remain elevated at ~14% over FY22-23E as tractor segment contribution remains elevated at ~44% (v/s 37% in FY18-20).

Outlook

We reiterate BUY with revised SoTP based price target of Rs851 (v/s Rs826, largely led by increase in subs value).

Emkay Global Financial's report on Mahindra and Mahindra

Management has re-emphasized focus on stringent capital allocation with the cancellation of a proposed JV with Ford due to the requirement of higher-than-planned investments and the possibility of a longer time period to achieve desired ROE of 18%. Efforts continue towards the sale of a majority stake in Ssangyong, and talks have commenced with a potential buyer. In the event of failure of divestment process, bankruptcy process would commence. To strengthen position in UVs, two new platforms are planned. In addition, MM is exploring alliance with Ford on joint product development for two new products - B and C segment SUVs. Efforts will also continue on new product launches in the EV space.

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) on January 1, 2021 said it is in discussions with a potential investor to sell its majority stake in South Korean arm SsangYong Motor Company (SYMC) which has already filed for bankruptcy, and expects to sign a non-binding agreement next week.

The Mumbai-based auto major, which currently holds nearly 75 percent in the Korean firm, expects to finalise the deal by February end.

""We are in discussion with a potential investor for majority stake in SsangYong. We hope to conclude the term sheet with the investor sometime next week,"" M&M Managing Director Pawan Goenka told reporters in a virtual press conference.

On December 21, the homegrown automaker had announced that SYMC has filed for bankruptcy.

The loss making firm has filed an application for commencement of rehabilitation procedure with the Seoul Bankruptcy Court under the Debtor Rehabilitation and Bankruptcy Act of South Korea.

The troubled automaker has also applied for an autonomous restructuring support (ARS) programme which is a court-designed process.

""Under ARS scheme the court gives approval to the company to find solution on its own in certain timeframe and during this time the company is managed by its management and the court doesn't intervene,"" Goenka said.

He further said: ""The court has granted ARS to SYMC and the date is February 28, so we have two more months from now to conclude a deal with the investor.""

If the deal gets concluded then things continue normally and if the deal doesn't happen then SYMC goes into court receivership and its management is taken over by the court, Goenka noted.

""It will be known on March 1 and we do hope that during this two-month period we will complete the deal with the investor.

If the deal goes through, the majority ownership will be with the new investor, Mahindra will be in minority with around 30 percent or less and the company will also do 25 percent capital reduction which is allowed under RBI regulation,"" he added.

Goenka also noted that SYMC trade union is supportive of the ARS process.

He however did not name the investor with whom the negotiations were going on.

Elaborating further, Mahindra Group Deputy Managing Director and Group CFO Anish Shah said the company was optimistic that a buyer may come in and continue SsangYong operations.

""If that doesn't happen, then the company will go through pre-package rehabilitation and there could be other options as well but in either scenario from M&M standpoint we would cease to be the majority shareholder before the end of this fiscal year,"" he noted.

Commenting on financials involved with SYMC, he said: ""We have around Rs 980 crore of equity, we have guaranteed Rs 680 crore of loans from foreign banks and 40 billion Korean won (around Rs 270 crore) that we have already put in loans. So, Rs 980 crore of equity and Rs 950 crore on debt.""

The extent of potential write-offs will depend upon what scenario plays out, Shah added.

SYMC has reasonable amount of assets and it should be therefore able to support both the debt equity, he noted.

""M&M doesn't have any further liability beyond these equity and debt numbers which we have shared,"" Shah further said.

In December 2020, M&M had informed the bourses that SYMC has missed repayments of loans aggregating to 60 billion Korean won (around Rs 408 crore).

The Korean automaker has outstanding loans aggregating to 100 billion Korean won (around Rs 680 crore) from Seoul-based branches of JP Morgan Chase Bank, BNP Paribas and Bank of America.

Already, JP Morgan has sought repayment of loan worth 40 billion Korean won from SYMC and the South Korean automaker has expressed its inability to pay the amount now.

In April last year, M&M board had rejected a proposal to inject any fresh equity into SYMC.

The Mumbai-based auto major had acquired the loss-making SsangYong in 2010 but has failed to turn it around since then despite several attempts.

M&M has since invested over $110 million in the loss making automaker. SsangYong has been struggling with deteriorating earnings since 2017 when it slipped into the red with a net loss of 66 billion won as against a net profit of 58 billion won in 2016.

In 2018, its net loss rose to 62 billion won and then ballooned to 341 billion won in 2019."

Mahindra and Mahindra's (M&M) plan to become a global maker of sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) has hit a roadblock after cash-strapped SsangYong Motor filed for bankruptcy.

M&M's share in the domestic SUV market has declined significantly, while it faces competition from Maruti Suzuki India and Hyundai Motor, according to a Mint report.

M&M's management bandwidth was stretched by multiple businesses such as electric vehicles, two-wheelers and shared mobility, executives told the paper.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

South Korean automaker SsangYong Motor filed for receivership in a Seoul court on December 22. M&M had acquired SsangYong in 2010 and owns 75 percent equity in the company.

M&M did not comment when contacted by Mint.

SsangYong reported losses for 15 consecutive quarters and also defaulted on repayment of bank loans. M&M had in April declined to inject new funds into the South Korean SUV maker and is looking for buyers for its stake in the company.

""The idea was to build on the success of Bolero, Scorpio and XUV500 (SUVs) and make a mark in the premium and bigger SUV segments in India while building scale for SsangYong along with entering several lucrative export markets,"" a source told the publication.

""Mahindra's decade-long ownership of SsangYong should not be looked at in black and white alone. It did launch the Rexton and the Tivoli-based XUV300 SUVs in India. While SsangYong Rexton as a brand failed to create value initially, it remains unclear why M&M pulled the plug on it,"" another source told the paper."

Further, it announced exit from the Aerospace business, which had losses of INR3-4b in FY20. While MM’s core business would recover faster, focus on tightening capital allocation could act as a re-rating catalyst. Hence, we see twin levers of EPS growth and re-rating. -

Outlook

We upgrade FY21/FY22E EPS by 8%/6.5% to reflect volume upgrade in Tractors as well as tighter cost control. MM is one of the few Auto stocks still trading at a good discount to LPA. Maintain Buy with TP of INR800.

Standalone EBITDA in Q2FY21 was at Rs 1,890 crore with corresponding EBITDA margins at 16.1% (up 358 bps YoY). The margin performance was attributable to lower other expenses (down 287 bps YoY), employee costs (down 50 bps YoY). Auto segment posted ~30 bps increase in EBIT margins YoY to 4.3% while tractor margins were up strongly by ~510 bps YoY to 24.4%. Consequent standalone PAT came in at Rs 77 crore. PAT came in substantially lower as the company took a large impairment hit of Rs 1,150 crore on certain long-term investments.

Outlook

We expect sales, adjusted PAT to grow at 8%, 36.2% CAGR, respectively, in FY20-23E.

M&M’s 2QFY21 results exceeded our expectations with record EBITDA margins delivery by M&M+MVML’s at 17.8% (+370bp YoY, PLe ~14%). The beat was led by strong performance in FES. EBIT margins for FES was recorded at 24.4% (+5% YoY) led by operating leverage and cost controls. In 2QFY21, with focus on prudent capital allocation, M&M exited Gipps Aerospace business (Aircraft manufacturing division). Also it was able to turn around key global FES subs to EBIT positive (2Q contribution postive at Rs30m v/s loss of Rs560m YoY). We are positive on MM as 1) better rural sentiments should help drive FES and auto segments over FY21-23 and 2) continued focus on exiting non core/loss making business bode well for re-rating.

While tractor revenue for the company witnessed a strong 33% growth in 2QFY21, autos remained weak registering 8% decline. EBIT for automotive division expanded by 70bps YoY to 6.5% while EBIT margin for FES improved by 500bps YoY to 24%.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Mahindra and Mahindra

Q2FY21 EBITDA margin expanded 370bps to 17.8%, above estimates of 14.8%, mainly due to better margin in the Tractor segment and cost reduction efforts. EBIT margin for Tractors expanded by 510bps to 24.4%, while Auto margin expanded 70bps to 6.5%. After a 31% decline in H1FY21 volumes, we expect a turnaround in H2FY21/FY22E with growth of 10%/18%, owing to continuation of growth in tractors, pick-up in CV sales cycle and positive response for new Thar UV. Capital allocation and efficiency remain key focus areas. Management has reiterated the stoppage of incremental investments in Ssangyong and has announced the closure of Gipps Aerospace operations.

Outlook

We expect revenues/earnings CAGR at 7%/15% over FY20-23E. Maintain Buy with a TP of Rs783 (Rs718 earlier), based on 17x Core P/E on FY23E (Sep’22E earlier) and value of investments at Rs208/share.

A CNBC-TV18 poll had estimated the number to the tune of Rs 1,075 crore.

The company reported a one-time loss of Rs 1,149.5 crore, CNBC-TV18 reported.

Revenue (M&M + MVML) for the said quarter came at Rs 11,590 crore, up 6 percent YoY agianst Rs 10,935 crore in Q2FY20.

The number was above CNBC-TV18 poll's estimates at Rs 11,113 crore.

EBITDA came at Rs 2,057 crore against CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 1,643 crore and EBITDA margin came at 17.7 percent against CNBC-TV18 poll of 14.7 percent.

The company said in Q2F2021, the Indian tractor industry reported a growth of 41.4 percent which is the highest ever Q2 quarter growth for the tractor industry.

""Timely relaxation of the COVID lockdown restrictions for the agricultural sector supported by healthy reservoir levels, a good increase in MSP for Kharif crops and important reforms in the agri sector announced by the government focused on improving the state of agriculture in India in the mid to long-term have helped tractor demand to bounce back after April 2020,"" said the company.

""On the back of these positive factors, it is expected that tractor demand will remain robust during the upcoming festive season,"" it added.

On a consolidated basis, M&M's revenue from operations for Q2FY21 stood at Rs 23,566.75 crore against Rs 23,935.93 crore YoY.

The automotive segment's revenue stood at Rs 11,080.89 crore against Rs 12,058.79 crore YoY. Revenue from the farm equipment segment stood at Rs 6,478.24 crore against Rs 5,369.89 crore YoY.

Automobile loading is getting a renewed push as the Indian Railways looks to achieve a modal share of 20 percent by the end of 2021-22, and a modal share of 30 percent by 2023-24.

The national transporter has also announced a slew of measures to augment its initiatives like setting up seven new terminals for automobile loading.

Abhilesh Babel, CEO, Infra Advisory, Feedback Infra, feels it makes sense for both the Tamil Nadu and NCR auto manufacturers to use Railways as it is much cheaper than road.

""Originally, this was started by Hyundai Motors when they were sending cars to north India. Today, Maruti Suzuki also transports a significant amount of volume via rail and coastal shipping. This shift is secular and is bound to continue over the next few years. Auto companies have been working with Railways in designing of auto rakes and ensuring seamless transportation. Once the upcoming Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) comes up, the volume will increase even further as DFC allows for time-tabled rake movements,"" he told Moneycontrol.

Apart from Maruti and Hyundai, other carmakers like Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, Kia are also using the services of Railways.

In a tweet posted last month, Anand Mahindra acknowledged the efforts of the Indian Railways for transporting its Bolero pick-up vans from Navi Mumbai to Benapole in Bangladesh.

Railways operates two types of rakes — small rakes, which can carry 100-125 cars and big rakes, which can carry 275 to 318 cars.

In the first six months of the current year, Railways loaded 836 rakes of automobiles against 731 rakes in the previous financial year despite almost negligible loading in the first two months of FY21, while in September, the segment witnessed a jump of 120 percent than the same period a year ago."

To take things to the next level, Ford’s Indian SUVs will now be designed by Pininfarina, a company known for some of the most beautifully designed cars over the last half-century.

Ford and Mahindra have been jointly developing SUVs for the Indian market and now, reports on the internet suggest that Mahindra-owned Pininfarina has been onboarded to design these SUVs. Given the beautiful lineup from Pininfarina, including their multiple decades of collaboration with Ferrari, these SUVs will probably be the most anticipated in the market.

The two companies are currently developing a C-SUV, the likes of which will rival the Tata Harrier and the MG Hector. The platform for this is expected to be based on the next-gen XUV500 and a version of Ford’s SUV.

Later, a B-SUV will also be unveiled rivalling the Kia Seltos and Hyundai Creta probably some time in the second half of FY22. Engine options could be from the Mahindra mStallion family, a 163 PS 2.2-litre turbo-petrol and up to a 1.5-litre diesel.

A Ford EcoSport is also said to be under development considering the compact SUV is nearing the end of its life-cycle. This could also receive design inputs from Pininfarina to keep the styling similar across all segments.

When these new SUVs actually make it to the streets we will have to see, but it can’t be too long a time away. With Pininfarina, designer of iconic Ferraris like the Berlinetta Boxer and the Daytona, having a hand in these new SUVs, people will be clamouring to have a look at what Ford will be bringing to the table."

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

Mahindra & Mahindra’s (MM) 1QFY21 earnings were driven by strong performance in the tractor business. Demand recovery was most prominent in tractors, which has led to supply constraints. While MM’s core business would recover faster, the focus on tightening capital allocation could act as a re-rating catalyst. Hence, we see twin levers of EPS growth and re-rating.

Outlook

We upgrade FY21/FY22E EPS by 9%/3% to reflect the volume upgrade in tractors and UVs, as well as the improving mix. M&M is one of the few Auto stocks trading at a good discount to LPA. Maintain Buy with TP of INR720.

Sharekhan's research repor on Mahindra and Mahindra

Mahindra & Mahindra (MM+MVML) Q1FY21 results were below our as well as street estimates due to lower than anticipated margin performance in automotive segment. The tractor segment’s margins surprised positively with y-o-y improvement. Due to strong farm sentiments, M&M expects tractor industry to grow in FY2021. We expect M&M to gain market share in tractors, Automotive segment is also witnessing recovery due to robust rural sentiments and increased preference for personal transport. Tighter capital allocation strategy of no fund infusion in businesses with an unclear path to profitability will continue and M&M is evaluating the performance of its international subsidiaries. Valuations at 12x core FY22 earnings are lower than long term historical average.



Outlook

We retain Buy rating on the stock with unchanged PT of Rs 750. M&M continues to remain our preferred pick in the automotive space.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

We upgrde M&M to BUY (v/s Hold) led by increasing focus on capital allocation, plans for loss-making subsidiaries (exit or turnaround) and preference to rural exposure. Its emhasis placed on the core intensifies with active search of partner for Sangyong, no bid for truck supply contract in US (under MANA), GenZ exit. We believe these are initial steps to fix ROEs with likely more consolidation. Furthermore, FES segment has strong outlook led by healthy farm sentiments where as widened auto segment losses should improve 2Q onwars. The management also hinted that stake sale in EV business could be an additional catalyst for value unlocking in unlisted subsidiaries. With improved rural outlook, we increase consol EPS by 4%/8% as we expect contribution of high margin FES segment to remain elevated.



Outlook

This has resulted in 50bp/70bp uprade in FY22/23 margins. Hence, we upgrade the stock to BUY with revised SoTP based TP of Rs703 (from Rs531).

Dolat Capital's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

MM's Q1FY21 standalone + MVML EBITDA at Rs.5.73bn was slightly below estimates due to weak performance in the Auto segment offset by higher-than-expected margin in the farm equipment segment (FES). EBIT margin for FES improved by 114bps YoY to 20.4%. Management highlighted that the near term demand outlook is promising fueled by improved rural sentiment, but difficult to make long-term forecasts. Outlook for the tractor remains strong led by good monsoon and better prospects for Kharif crop. We expect low channel inventory (auto and farm) is expected to support wholesale in the near term. Moreover, new launches like new Thar (expected to launch in festive season) and strong rural demand for Bolero, Scorpio and the pick-ups will provide support after the festive season. The company is focused on strengthening core business, tightening capital allocation and turning around its core/strategic subsidiaries. The management is looking to bring down its stake to below 50% in Ssangyong Motors and in talks with potential investors.



Outlook

M&M’s exposure (Tractor+ Auto) to the rural market at about 65% is one of the highest among its peers. These areas are not expected to be as impacted by the on-going COVID-19 disruption as urban ones. We value the core business at Rs.537/share (16x FY23 core EPS) and subsidiaries at Rs.155/share, and recommend Accumulate the stock, with a TP of Rs.692.

Homegrown auto major Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) is looking for strategic partners for its electric vehicles business in order to further scale it up, a top company official said on Friday. The auto major, which reported a 94 per cent decline in consolidated profit at Rs 54.64 crore for the June quarter, also said there is no impact of COVID-19 on its EV launch plans.

The automaker has invested significant capital in the segment and that gives it confidence to find partners, M&M Managing Director Pawan Goenka told reporters in a conference call.

To a query on whether it was open to partnerships in the EV business, Goenka said, ""We are open to it and working on it. We currently are engaged with multiple interested parties to invest in Mahindra Electric and the process is going on.""

""We have invested in Bangalore, and just completed investing in Chakan for high range of batteries. We are fairly well invested and that gives us advantage in India which would be driving growth in the segment going ahead,"" he noted.

He said the company has many products on the ground and there are new launches planned over the next 12 months as well.

""So finding partners for Mahindra Electric won't be such a difficult task as it would be for some other companies,"" Goenka emphasised.

He said M&M is keen on becoming a significant player in the EV space with Mahindra Electric on one side and its Italy-based arm Automobili Pininfarina (APF) with its high-end models on the other end.

Goenka said M&M is also evaluating to further extend the APF product portfolio going ahead.

The launch of the first super sports car from the APF stable, Battista, which was to happen this year, has now been moved to next year due to the COVID-19 scenario.

M&M also said it is seeking investors for its Korean arm SsangYong Motor Company (SYMC).

""We are looking for investors for SYMC as we have decided not to further invest in it. The South Korean firm is in dialogue with certain investors and we will be announcing that at an appropriate time on the status of those investors,"" Goenka said.

The M&M board had decided on April 3 this year that the company will not make any further investment in SYMC other than USD 32 million to help the Korean firm tide over the immediate fund requirements.

On the domestic business, M&M Executive Director - Automotive and Farm Sectors, Rajesh Jejurikar said demand is very robust in tractors and the only challenge is to manage the supply chain disruptions.

On the 80 per cent drop in automotive revenue in the first quarter, he said, ""With that kind of drop in revenue, anyone would come under pressure. We, though, believe that we have done better than all our peers. Our performance has been pretty robust in context of 80 per cent drop in revenue.""

Goenka said he does not foresee any dark clouds on the tractor side but challenges do remain in the passenger vehicle segment.

""On the auto side, ramp up is somewhat more difficult due to the complexity that we have in supply chain,"" he added.

The picture would be clear in the next three-four months as in how fast the company would be able to ramp up its production, Goenka said.

On increasing competition in the domestic market, Jejurikar said the company is confident of a good show going ahead with its upcoming range of products."

According to Emkay Global, the revenue decline could be 54 percent and profit may fall by 73 percent. ""Realisations are expected to increase in the automotive segment due to higher spares mix and price hikes (BS6, safety norms and cost inflation),"" said the brokerage.

On the operating front, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) may decline over 55 percent due to negative operating leverage but better gross margin may limit contraction in EBITDA margin.

""EBITDA margin contraction is limited, on account of better gross margins, despite a sharp fall in volumes. Gross margin is expected to improve due to benign mix (higher share of tractors and spares) and lower input cost,"" Emkay Global said.

The stock gained 14.7 percent year-to-date. During Q1 FY21, it surged 79 percent on hopes of growth in tractors segment due to normal monsoon, strong Kharif season minimal effect of lockdown on agricultural activities."

Mahindra & Mahindra on Saturday reported 27 percent jump in its tractor sales at 25,402 units in July. The company had sold 19,992 units of tractor in July 2019, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) said in a statement.

Domestic sales grew 28 percent to 24,463 units in July this year, as compared to 19,174 units in the year-ago month, it added.

Exports during the month stood at 939 units, as compared to 818 units in July last year, up 15 percent, the company said.

""These are our highest ever July sales. The strong demand momentum continued, aided by positive sentiments due to good cash flows to farmers, higher Kharif sowing, a timely and normal monsoon cumulatively across June and July and continued higher rural spending by the government,"" M&M President - Farm Equipment Sector Hemant Sikka said.

He, however, said localised lockdowns in certain states and COVID-19 related impact on specific suppliers led to supply-side challenges during the month.

On the outlook, he said, ""it is expected that the sentiments are likely to remain buoyant translating into robust tractor demand in the coming months."""

Now, the company has launched the BS-VI compliant motorcycle but everything else remains the same.

The new BS-VI Mojo also gets a price hike of Rs 11,000 and prices go up depending on the colour option you choose.

The new bike is powered by the same 294.7cc single-cylinder that did duty on the old BS-IV bike, but the engine has been updated to comply with the new norms. The company hasn’t unveiled the output figures yet, but the old engine made 26.29 PS of power and 28 Nm of torque. Expect a slight drop in these figures, thanks to the upgrade.

There is probably also a minor increase in weight thanks to the addition of a catalytic converter. Rest of the parts remain the same. You get conventional telescopic front forks and a rear monoshock. A320 mm front disc and 240 mm rear disc handle braking supervised by dual-channel ABS.

The company hasn’t changed the bikes aesthetic either and still continues with its muscular, street-naked design and dual round headlamps.

The Mahindra Mojo gets four colour schemes – Black Pearl, Red Agate, Ruby Red and Garnet Black. Prices start at Rs 1.99 lakh and go up to Rs 2.11 lakh. Bookings for the new Mahindra Mojo can be made for a token amount of Rs 5,000."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M’s (MM) FY20 annual report focuses on strengthening core business and tightening capital allocation based on renewed management focus on turning around its core/strategic subsidiaries. Losses at key auto/farm subsidiaries have negatively contributed to PAT (-107%) in FY20 largely led by SsangYong (SYMC), MUSA and other 2W subs. MM’s intention to partially/fully exit some of these (SYMC) and scale up ailing ones (like MUSA) can be key catalyst going forward. For FY21 key priorities include: A) work towards turnaround of global operations with launch of new tractor platform ‘K2’ and B) auto business - launch of new products and scale up of gasoline engine. While we like the intention of the management on prudent capital allocation, we would like to see better execution on the same.

Outlook

Hence we maintain Hold with SOTP based TP of Rs531 (unchanged). We value core auto business at 13x (unchanged) plus subsidiary value of Rs106 at 50% holdco discount.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

Our last report on M&M – ‘A generational shift underway’ (3rd Jun’20), highlights big changes within the company (CEO change) and its operating environment (agri reforms). The CEO Designate laid out a clear path to address underlying issues and create value through (a) tough actions on loss-making subsidiaries, (b) tightening of capital norms, (c) differentiation of the core SUV positioning, and (d) the realization of nine businesses’ potential identified as billion-dollar candidates. - One of the key questions from the investors has been regarding how much of the recent outperformance of MM was driven by change in the CEO and capital allocation promise. M&M’s top-quartile stock performance is lagging other rural focus names. The analysis of DII portfolio suggests they remain skeptical of the change (under-weight at 0.47% of AUMs v/s 1.07% weight of M&M in Nifty). - We believe M&M’s operating performance on its own warrants a good 17% upside as the stock is trading at ~29% discount to 5-year average P/E, with scope of re-rating if capital allocation is indeed corrected. Maintain Buy with TP of INR600.

Outlook

Our Jun’22E-based SOTP TP is ~INR600/share – an upside of ~20%. At our TP, implied Core P/E is ~13.9x (v/s 5-year average core P/E of ~15.9x and 10-year average of ~14.3x). Maintain Buy.

Technical View

The share price logged a resolute breakout from long term falling trend line, indicating conclusion of corrective trend, auguring well for structural turnaround. Thereby offering fresh entry opportunity to ride next leg of major up move Over past three months stock have shown resilience by relatively outperforming the Auto index, supported by 2x volume of 52 weeks average volume throughout this phase, highlighting accumulation at elevated support base Currently stock has closed above its 52 weeks SMA (at Rs 508) for the first time since October 2018, indicating rejuvenation of major up trend The aforementioned evidences makes us confident to believe, stock would form a higher base at 52 weeks SMA and pave the way to head towards Rs588 in coming months as it is 61.8% retracement of Dec-18 to Mar-20 decline (Rs 814 – 245), at Rs 596 coincided with February 2020 high Rs590

Fundamental View

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) has significant exposure to the rural economy through its tractor division where it is market leader and commands 41.2% domestic market share as of FY20. We expect the tractor segment to stay largely unaffected by demand side issues being faced by the rest of the automotive industry, courtesy stability in the outlook of rural incomes (on the back of good Rabi crop harvest, remunerative crop prices, healthy water table levels and expectations of a normal monsoon in 2020) and lack of regulatory disruption like BS-VI norms. Longer term demand drivers like the government’s continued focus on doubling farm incomes and improving rural infrastructure as well as underpenetrated nature of farm mechanisation in India stay intact In our view, the tractor segment would see a quicker revival than other automotive segments once Covid-19 related supply side shocks abate and M&M as the clear market leader would benefit. The company is already back to 80% capacity utilisation in this division, with >90% dealers operational. Farm equipment is highly profitable segment for M&M wherein it realises ~20% EBIT margins and even better capital efficiency with segmental RoCE at >50%.

Arihant Capital 's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M + MVML reported weak operating performance was offset marginally by margin expansion. Net sales stood at Rs. 90,047 mn (-34.8% YoY / -27.1% QoQ). Gross margins expanded by 40 bps to 35.7% driven by commodity cost benefits and cost rationalization measures by the company. EBITDA was at Rs. 12,275 mn (-34.3% YoY / -25.6% QoQ) with margin of 13.6% (+1bps YoY / +3bps QoQ). PAT was at Rs 3,226 (-70% YoY / -64.4% QoQ). PAT after exceptional items was primarily impacted due to write down of investment in Ssangyong and some other international subsidiaries. The total volumes (auto + tractors) de-grew by 35.6% YoY to 1.51L units led by subdued demand. The blended realisation has seen an increase of 36% YoY to Rs 8.02L per unit on account of better product mix. On the Concall, the management indicated quicker recovery in rural areas, driven by record rabi production, higher MSPs, outlook of a normal monsoon, and increased rural spending by the government. Further, the pace of recovery in tractors has surprised positively (May wholesales reached near normal) and the company is ramping production in the tractor space. The board also recommended a final dividend of Rs 2.35 per equity share for the financial year 2019-20.



Outlook

At CMP of Rs 508, M&M currently trades at FY20 PE of 17.2x.M&M earnings were ahead street estimates as company managed to maintain margins despite the steep fall in the topline. However Prolonged COVID-19 infection could dampen consumer sentiments and impact demand. Further, increased competitive intensity in the utility vehicles segment could affect stock. Further, the pace of recovery in tractors has surprised positively (May wholesales reached near normal) and the company is ramping production in the tractor space led by strong margin execution and guidance of further cost-cutting initiatives. At CMP of Rs 508, stock is trading at core PE of 17.5x FY22. We upgrade our rating to Buy from Hold earlier and value it with SOTP valuation for a target price of Rs 621.

LKP Research's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

In line with 36% decline in the total volumes, the topline fell by 35%. Volumes at the auto segment fell by 47% driven by 56% fall in the SUV segment. FES segment fell by just 2% as tractor demand was still intact in Q4. Margins surprised the street as they came in 70 bps higher yoy at 12.4% on the back of better product mix which was tilted towards high margin tractors, cost saving initiatives and RM tailwinds. According to management, last 7 days of March (due to COVID related lockdown) resulted in a volume loss of ~15,000 vehicles, out of which ~13,000 was on the tractors side. Despite this, the company increased its market share in tractors by 1% to ~40% and in LCVs by 3%. During the quarter, M&M revisited their capital allocation program in which they exited their loss making EV 2W US subsidiary and decided not to increase their investments in the lackluster Ssangyong business. This led to a one time impairment charge of Rs27.8 bn leading to a reported loss of Rs25 bn. However, if we exclude this charge, then the company reported a profit of Rs2.78 bn. This was still a drop of 71% yoy due to a fall in topline and operating profit.



Outlook

We maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a downward revised target of Rs589 (valuing the standalone business at 11x times FY22E earnings and the subsidiaries at Rs200).

ICICI Direct's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) reported a healthy operational performance in Q4FY20. Standalone net sales at Rs 9,144 crore were down 35% YoY (automotive revenues down 46%, tractor revenues down 3%), with automotive segment ASPs at Rs 6.1 lakh/unit and tractors segment ASP at Rs 5.3 lakh/unit being positive surprises. Standalone EBITDA margins at 12.4% were down 100 bps QoQ, with 290 bps gross margin expansion being overshadowed by negative operating leverage. Consequent standalone loss at PAT level of Rs 2,500 crore tracked exceptional charge of Rs 2,800 crore for impairment of investments due to Covid-19 and others.



Outlook

We expect sales, adjusted PAT to grow at 4.3%, 50.1% CAGR, respectively, in FY20P-22E. M&M’s sharpened focus on capital allocation provides us further confidence in our constructive stance on the company. We maintain BUY rating on M&M, valuing it at Rs 600/share on SOTP basis (6.5x FY22E EV/EBITDA for base business; 30% holdco discount to its investments).

MM+MVML 4QFY20 performance were operationally better with EBITDA at Rs12.3b (PLe Rs9.5b) due to improved gross margins at 35.7% (PLe 33.8%). We believe while MM to see market share gains in tractor segment due to positive farm sentiments, headwinds in the auto segment continue to persist. With improved rural outlook in near to mid term, we increase our S/A EPS by 4.5%/12.1% as we expect contribution of high margin FES segment to remain elevated. This has resulted in ~100bp uprade in FY22 margins to 12.2%.

Sharekhan's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

Mahindra & Mahindra’s (MM+MVML) Q4FY2020 operating results were ahead of our as well as street estimates as the company managed to maintain margins despite the steep fall in the topline. Going ahead, management expects quicker recovery in rural areas driven by record rabi production, higher MSP’s, outlook of a normal monsoon and increased rural spending by Government. We expect M&M to perform better than other automotive players given it derives 35% from tractor segment (which is a pure rural play) and also derives about half of the automotive volumes from the hinterlands. Valuations at 12.5x FY22 core earnings are lower than long term historical average of 15x.



Outlook

We retain Buy rating on the stock with a revised PT of Rs. 583. M&M continues to remain our preferred pick in the automotive space.

Emkay Global Financial's report on Mahindra and Mahindra

Q4FY20 revenue declined 35% yoy to Rs90bn (est. Rs86bn). EBITDA margin expanded by 10bps to 13.6%, above estimates of 11.2%, due to a change in inventory and cost saving initiatives. Considering the lockdown and hopes of gradual pickup in demand, we cut FY21 volume estimate by 15% to 0.60mn units, but broadly retain FY22E volume at 0.79mn units. We expect recovery from H2FY21 on a low base, pent-up demand and better rural sentiment. Domestic tractor volume growth turned positive in May'20, and the momentum is expected to continue on a low base, pent-up demand and better customer sentiment. We expect marginal growth of 1% in FY21E and 13% in FY22E.



Outlook

We are positive on MM due to large exposure to rural demand and management efforts to tighten capital allocation norms. We maintain Buy, with a TP of Rs572 (Rs490 earlier), based on 15x Core P/E (13x earlier), and value of investments at Rs146/share.

Mahindra & Mahindra (MM)'s 4QFY20 performance beat was led by a better mix and lower RM cost. While MM's core business would recover faster, the focus on tightening capital allocation could act as a rerating catalyst.



Outlook

We upgrade FY21/FY22E EPS by 8%/2% to reflect an improving mix. An improving core business and possible course correction on capital allocation would drive stock performance as valuations are still cheap. Buy, with TP of ~INR585.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

MM's 4QFY20 standalone + MVML EBITDA of Rs.12.27bn was ahead of estimates, due to higher-than-expected realization and margin improvement in the farm equipment segment (FES). The EBIT margin in FES rose 146 bps YoY to 17.6%, however, it contracted by 471 bps YoY to 4.1% in the automotive division. The reported PAT was impacted by Rs.36bn provision for impairment in investments in Ssangyong and other international subsidiaries. In tractors, MM gained a market share of 1% to 41.2% in FY20. In our view, M&M is well placed to further increase its market share in the domestic tractor segment, as the industry outlook is positive, given the record output of the Rabi crop and a favourable initial prediction of this year’s monsoon. M&M’s exposure (tractor+ Auto) to rural market at about 65% is one the highest among its peers. These areas are not expected to be as impacted by the on-going COVID-19 disruption as urban ones. The company is trying to tighten its capital allocation policy, and investments will be monitored strictly. The company has already impaired investments at Ssangyong in Korea and has shut down the GenZe EV business in USA.



Outlook

We value the core business at Rs.389/share (15x FY22E core EPS) and subsidiaries at Rs. 163/share, and recommend Accumulate the stock, with a TP of Rs.552.

Mahindra and Mahindra on June 12 posted a massive loss of Rs 3,255 crore in the quarter ended March 2020 due to the write-down of investment in Ssangyong and other international subsidiaries.

Profit in the year-ago quarter was Rs 969.2 crore.

The profit before one-time loss stood at Rs 890 crore for the March quarter against profit of Rs 1,515 crore in the same period last year, said the automobile company in its BSE filing.



Revenue from operations declined 34.8 percent year-on-year, which was ahead of Street estimates, to Rs 9,005 crore in Q4 FY20.

Management Participants: Anand Mahindra- Chairman, Pawan Goenka- MD & CEO, Anish Shah- Dy MD & Group CFO, Rajesh Jejurikar- Executive Director

According to the management of Mahindra & Mahindra, Q4 FY20 volumes were impacted majorly by three factors: a) disruption in the supply chain from China due to COVID-19, b) fire at a key supplier's plant in February 2020 and c) plant shutdown in the last 10 days of March due to the lockdown in the country.

M&M’s JV with Ford: The start was delayed because of COVID-19. Major Benefits will include - co-sharing of investments & technology, economies of scale in joint sourcing, joint product development and capacity utilization, exports to emerging markets.

Farm equipment was up by 1 percent and auto LCV was less than 3.5T up 1.2 percent.

The company's capital allocation strategy will continue to stay strong, going ahead. It had good cash flows from rural. In May 2020, the company saw good financing, as well as, good amount of collections, were made. June 2020 is also going well, the management said. For FY21 it will remain largely the same considering its three big projects are at the final stage of product development so now reduction can’t be done.

For FY22-FY24 Capex is being reduced from Rs 4,000 crore per annum to Rs 3,000 crore per annum, the management said.

Farm Equipment Sector Outlook:

Strong rural opportunity, very good reservoir levels, very good rabi output and significant govt spending are expected to bring good pickup. On the tractor side, key challenge for the company is to ramp up operations. More than 90 percent of dealers have reopened and plants are operating at 80 percent plus capacity, they said.

The key focus will be to strengthen core domestic business, build farm machinery, turnaround global businesses, build a moat through farming as a service (faas) and k2 project. “Krish-e”: Mahindra Krish-e farming services are on a mission to bridge the gap between agriculture and new-age technology in India. Project K: It is Light Weight Compact Global Tractor Project ranging from 13-70 HP tractors range, the management added.

North America tractor business will be very important part of its global turnaround strategy. Rural is very important for the company and constitute more than 45 percent of its volumes.

Automotive sector outlook:

Key focus: The company is looking for growth in rural, goods mobility and improving dealer and supplier’s financial health. Plants are operational at 30 percent capacity. All suppliers are working and 80 percent of its dealers are operational. XUV300 and Bolero have received very good feedback and is going to be the volume drivers going ahead. Two new models W601, Z101 are to be launched in early FY22.

Supro focus: Traction seen in PV and goods mobility post COVID era, the management of Mahindra & Mahindra said."

The farm equipment segment registered a half a percent YoY growth in volumes at 57,164 tractors during the quarter. Company said good Rabi outlook, increased government spend in rural, along with better liquidity conditions in the market led to improved sentiments in agri and rural economy, though the industry was adversely impacted in March because of the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 outbreak.

M&M said it increased its market share in the domestic tractor market to 39.1 percent in Q4FY20, a growth of 3.7 percent over corresponding quarter previous year and continued to maintain its operating margin.

Automotive segment registered a 46.1 percent YoY decline in revenue at Rs 5,506 crore and 75 percent fall in EBIT at Rs 225.3 crore, while tractor business showed a 3 percent drop in revenue at Rs 3,111 crore.

Tractor segment at operating level showed 5.8 percent YoY growth in EBIT at Rs 549 crore and 140 bps rise in margin at 17.6 percent for the quarter.

At operating level, company's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) dropped 34.3 percent to Rs 1,227.4 crore, but margin expanded 10 bps to 13.6 percent in Q4.

Numbers, barring net level, beat analysts expectations. Revenue was estimated at Rs 8,606 crore and EBITDA was expected at Rs 956 crore with margin at 11 percent for the quarter, according to the average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

In FY20, company's profit declined 86 percent to Rs 740 crore and revenue fell 15 percent to Rs 44,866 crore compared to previous year, while margin remained unchanged at 14.2 percent.

Automobile company Mahindra and Mahindra on June 12 is expected to see sharp fall in March quarter earnings due to significant decline in sales volumes and weak operating performance.

Profit for the quarter is likely to see more than 50 percent decline and revenue may fall over 35 percent compared to same period last fiscal, according to brokerages.

The utility vehicle maker sold over 1.51 lakh units during the quarter ended March 2020, down 35.6 percent compared to more than 2.35 lakh units sold in same quarter previous fiscal. It was led by 47 percent YoY decline in auto volumes due to COVID-19-led lockdown and inventory correction of BS-4 stocks, and 3 percent fall in tractor volumes due to lockdown.

""We estimate revenues to decline by 40 percent YoY led by 36 percent YoY decline in volumes and 4 percent YoY decline in average selling price (ASPs) in Q4FY20,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees profit falling 59 percent YoY.

According to Narnolia, M&M is expected to post around 38 percent YoY decline in revenue led by decline in volumes, and 51 percent fall in profit. Realization is also expected to decline by 3 percent YoY, it said.

The management expects demand to remain in the negative zone in first half of FY21 and the recovery would also be slow, once the operations start post COVID-19 situation.

On the operating front, company's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is expected to decline by 45 percent YoY due to negative operating leverage in Q4FY20 and margin is seen contracting 105 bps YoY, said Kotak.

According to Sharekhan, operating margin is expected to fall by 100 bps YoY, as higher discounting to clear BS-4 inventory and negative operating leverage more than offset the benefits from lower commodity prices."

Motilal Oswal 's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

Mahindra & Mahindra's (MM) senior leadership is in midst of a generational shift, at a time when all its key businesses are facing cyclical or structural challenges. While the cycle for tractors should turn positive in the near term and for LCVs too in the not so distant future, the new CEO would have to address two major issues - (a) restore its positioning in the fast growing SUV segment, and (b) circumvent the drag of underperforming subsidiaries in the core/non-core businesses. We believe MM's valuations reflect the challenges of the Passenger UV business as well as no major changes on capital allocation policy. Any positive surprises in the SUV business, positive evolution of the Ford India JV or correction of capital allocation by the new CEO should act as re-rating triggers.



Outlook

We are lowering our EPS for FY21/22E by ~22%/4% to factor in the supply- side issues for Tractors and weaker volumes for Autos in FY21. We are now building in volume growth of 0%/12% for Tractors, -20%/22% for LCVs and -17%/10% for SUVs for FY21/22E. Our Jun'22E-based SOTP TP is ~INR576/share - an upside of ~25%. At our TP, implied Core P/E is ~13.6x (v/s 5-year average core P/E of ~15.9x and 10-year average of ~14.3x). Maintain Buy.

After a washout in April, there could be some improvement in auto sales in May given the relaxations from lockdown. The government allowed to open standalone shops, e-commerce sector, and several factories/industries with partial capacity (30-40 percent) in green and orange zones only. The companies will announce their May sales in the initial part of next week.

The nationwide lockdown began on March 25 and we will enter into fifth phase of lockdown on June 1 for a month which is restricted to containment zones only, so rest of India will re-open in phases from the second week of June.

Hence, May could be better than April wherein there was no or negligible sales (on a case-to-case basis) in India due to complete lockdown.

On a year-on-year basis, brokerages expect significant fall in sales of commercial vehicle (CV), passenger vehicle (PV) and two-wheelers, but tractor may a muted fall compared to other segments due to early re-opening of agricultural activities, good rabi harvest and news of normal monsoon this year.

""Our industry survey suggests that retail demand has recovered relatively faster in rural areas as rabi harvest has been good and government procurement of wheat has been high (wheat procurement in April-May already above FY20 levels). Hence, we expect a faster recovery in the tractor segment, followed by two-wheelers (2Ws) and PVs (in that order),"" Nomura said.

""However, financing remains a constraint as the percentage of buyers opting for the moratorium is the highest in medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCVs) (50-70 percent), followed by tractors (40-50 percent), and 2/4Ws (25-30 percent). Also, production ramp-up is likely to remain slow due to supply chain bottlenecks, social distancing norms, COVID-19 cases among workers and labour shortages,"" it added.

After relief for agriculture sector from lockdown and good rabi harvest, the inquiries for two-wheeler and passenger vehicles have been higher in May particularly in rural, tier-2 and tier-3 cities where there are many green and orange zones, but commercial vehicle segment has not seen any pick up in demand and inquiries, brokerages feel.

""Our interaction with leading industry channel partners indicates 2W/PVs are seeing a resurgence in inquiries (around 50 percent of normal at operational dealerships). On the other hand, CVs are seeing negligible demand (from the construction sector only). Overall consumer sentiment is low and even in rural markets, customers are cautious with spending given the uncertain environment,"" said Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage expects wholesales to decline substantially in May 2020 for all OEMs due to (a) the lockdown, (b) absence of non-discretionary demand, and (c) supply constraints. ""While demand for 2Ws and PVs is seeing some recovery from semi-urban and rural markets, CVs have minimal demand due to low economic activity and cautious financiers as many operators have already opted for the moratorium. Also, to lend to CVs/3Ws, financiers currently are stringent and highly risk-averse.""

In May, wholesale volumes are estimated to decline around 77/77/90 percent YoY for 2Ws/PVs/CVs due to the lockdown and low demand, while tractors volumes are expected to decline by around 71 percent YoY, said Motilal Oswal.

Retail sales in two-wheelers, PVs and CVs are also expected to see a massive fall on a year-on-year basis, but tractor sales could be better than others, brokerages feel.

""For May-20, we expect the PV industry to decline around 75 percent YoY. The recovery is likely to be slow due to higher share of top cities. Also, downtrading to smaller cars should benefit Maruti Suzuki,"" Nomura said.

For two-wheelers, the Japanese brokerage expects industry volumes to decline by around 84 percent YoY. ""The recovery in this segment is likely to be faster due to higher rural share. Also, a downtrading is likely in the <125cc segment due to lower price increase. This should benefit Hero Motocorp.""

In MHCVs, ""despatches are likely to remain very low. Only around 30 percent of the existing truck fleet is plying on the roads and there is virtually no demand for new trucks. We expect industry volumes to decline 96 percent YoY,"" Nomura said.

Given the challenges to both demand and supply, near-term volumes are not representative of underlying demand and may also be quite volatile, the brokerage feels.

Nomura has a buy call on Hero Motocorp in two-wheeler segment, while M&M remained its top pick in PV sector due to higher rural exposure where the recovery is faster, initiatives to address capital allocation concerns and attractive valuations.

Prabhudas Lilladher bets on Maruti Suzuki and Eicher Motors among original equipment manufacturers (OEM).

""In case of Maruti Suzuki, the structural levers are in-tact (continues shift in demand for a petrol vehicle, reducing JPY exposure and increasing share of premium products), while in Eicher Motors, Royal Enfield's focus on increasing penetration in key motorcycling states and gaining monopoly along with natural upgrade option in 300+cc category will help in global expansion,"" the brokerage explained.

Motilal Oswal's largecap picks are Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki.

""The near-term demand outlook is weak as we see a gradual restoration of normalcy post lifting of the lockdown. We hope for gradual recovery from second half of FY21, which should be led by the festive season,"" the brokerage said.

KPMG Samjong, the auditor of Mahindra and Mahindra-owned Korean automobile company SsangYong Motor, has issued a 'disclaimer of opinion' on the automaker's quarterly financial results, according to a a report by Yonhap News Agency.

SsangYong's net loss widened in the first quarter of this financial year, making it the 13th consecutive quarter where the company continues to post hefty losses. The auditor said these issues raised a question over the company's ability to remain viable.

As its current debts surpassed its current assets by 576.7 billion won this quarter, SsangYong's shares tumbled on the back of the news.

A 'disclaimer of opinion' is one among the four different types of auditor's opinions issued against a company's financial results.

Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra owns around a 74 percent stake in the Korean carmaker. SsangYong has been struggling to keep up its numbers due to declining sales, while the parent firm has yet decided against liquidity infusion.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Mahindra and Mahindra share price has gained for the fourth consecutive session, rising 10 percent intraday on April 9 after CRISIL reaffirmed its rating.

The stock rallied 31 percent in four straight sessions and one of the reasons for the rally was also the company's decision to stop injecting money into SsangYong Motor Company (SYMC).

It was trading at Rs 355.05, up Rs 28.50 or 8.73 percent on the BSE at 1345 hours IST.

M&M in its BSE filing on April 9 said CRISIL has reaffirmed its long term rating at AAA/Stable and short term rating at A1+ for the company's bank facilities.

The rating agency also reaffirmed its rating on the company's Rs 475 crore and Rs 500 crore non-convertible debentures at AAA/Stable, while the rating on commercial paper, which has been enhanced to Rs 1,000 crore from Rs 500 crore earlier, has also been reaffirmed at A1+, it added.

""The ratings continue to reflect M&M's leadership in the Indian tractor industry and healthy market position in light commercial vehicles (LCVs). The ratings also factor in a strong financial risk profile, supported by a robust balance sheet with low leverage and high financial flexibility,"" CRISIL said in its note.

These strengths are partially offset by exposure to cyclicality inherent in the farm equipment (tractor) and automotive (auto) segments, exposure to risks pertaining to acquisitions and investments in subsidiaries/joint ventures (JVs), and decline in market share in the utility vehicle (UV) space over the last few years, it added.

According to the rating agency, the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is expected to affect each of the major segments over the near term - both in terms of disruption of the supply chain, and/or end-demand.

""Nevertheless, M&M's strong capital structure and liquidity position, along with the benefit of diversification of its business profile supports its credit profile,"" CRISIL said.

Meanwhile, on April 3, M&M in its special board of directors meeting, reviewed investment in SsangYong Motor Company and took a decision that it will not be able to inject any fresh equity into SYMC and has urged SYMC to find alternate sources of funding.

""However, with a view to enable SYMC to have continuity of business operations, whilst they are exploring alternate sources of funding, the board has authorised the M&M management to consider a special one-time infusion of up to 40 billion KRW ($32 million) over the next three months,"" company said.

Moreover, M&M said it would make every effort to continue to support all other non-fund initiatives that are currently in place to help SYMC reduce capex, save costs and secure funds.

The board had received the request from the management and labour union of SsangYong Motor Company for fresh injection of equity from M&M to help the company fund 500 billion KRW ($406 million) of requirements over the next three years."

Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentous oscillator used to identify trend reversal. It was invented by Welles Wilder Junior.

The default look-back period for RSI is 14, however, this can be lowered to increase sensitivity, or raised to decrease sensitivity. RSI calculates the strength of a stock trend and helps to predict their reversals.

Why buy Mahindra & Mahindra?

There are a lot of trading strategies using RSI; below mentioned is one of the most popular among the trading community. This involves buy after completing retracement for higher movement; however the support of another momentum oscillator stochastic can give additional support.

In the past few days, RSI had given a breakout by trading above 50 levels from below and made a high of 82 then after it is trading lower or retracing towards centre line placed at 50 levels, this behaviour is called as ‘RSI PBB’ setup.

RSI PBB is pull back buy setup which indicates, once RSI turns its tail upside after taking support from a zone of 45-55 levels, the target is previous swing high of RSI which was 82 or previous swing high of prices (Rs 540). Currently, M&M is going through this setup and we expect higher price movement towards previous high Rs 540-550 levels in coming days.

Figure: RSI PBB setup and Buy signal on M&M

Buy Signal





Recent RSI gave a breakout and published swing top around 82 levels.



After marking high of 82, RSI is retracing towards 50 towards mid-line standing around 50 marks.

Mid-term moving average 50 DMA placed around 519 levels defines mid-term trend is very well augur with bulls as prices are sustained and trading above it.



Decent volume participation while forming a bullish candle will also give additional confirmation.



Whenever price candle will be near previous swing high which is near Rs 540-550 levels.

Stop Loss:

Entire bullish view negates on breaching of a swing low and one should exit from a long position. In the case of M&M, it is standing around Rs 504 levels.

Conclusion

We recommend buying M&M around Rs 516-521 levels with a stop loss of Rs 504 for higher targets of Rs 540 and Rs 550 levels as indicated in the above chart.

Auto manufacturing will have to grow by 14 per cent if India has to achieve the $5 trillion economy target, Mahindra and Mahindra Managing Director Pawan Goenka said on December 16. India has set an ambitious target of $5 trillion in the next five years and 12 per cent of it is expected to be contributed by the manufacturing sector.

""$5 trillion economy target by 2025-26 means a CAGR of 8.5 per cent. Within that, the target of manufacturing is $1 trillion, which means 12 per cent from manufacturing and within manufacturing, automotive plays a significant role. If manufacturing has to grow 12-13 per cent auto must grow by 14 per cent,"" Goenka said during a panel discussion at the India economic conclave 2019.

He further said currently the auto industry contributes 7 per cent of GDP which is good but when compared with the other major auto producing countries, which are all in double digits, the Indian industry's share is still lower.

""Auto is only 4 per cent of exports in India as compared to auto manufacturing countries like Thailand, Germany, Korea, and Japan which are more than 10 per cent,"" he added.

Speaking at the event, MG Motors India President and MD Rajiv Chaba opined that if the sector has to grow by 12-14 per cent it means there is a need to do something very different that the industry has been doing in the past 10 years.

""This year happens to be a bad year but last 10 years what we did if you repeat the same thing, we will not achieve and this number will be just a number. Secondly, export will play an important part but you will have to look at domestic more while we can improve exports. Engineering services also can be made strong,"" he added."

Hit by weak demand, utility vehicle and tractor-maker Mahindra and Mahindra is likely to report a double-digit decline in the September quarter earnings later on November 8.

The stock has corrected 28 percent year-to-date and during the quarter also, it was down 16.6 percent.

Brokerage houses expect the profit to fall in the range of 12-40 percent year-on-year and revenue is likely to decline more than 11 percent compared to the year-ago period.

Overall volumes in Q2FY20 declined by 16 percent YoY led by 8 percent fall in tractor volumes and 21 percent drop in auto volumes.

""We expect revenues to decline by 11 percent YoY in Q2FY20,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities, which expects profit to fall 25 percent YoY.

Motilal Oswal, which expects a 12.4 percent drop in profits, said the company's realisation was expected to improve 3.7 percent YoY (down 1 percent QoQ), as the impact of price increase would partly be offset by the product mix.

At operating level, Kotak expects EBITDA margin to decline by 120 bps YoY due to negative operating leverage.

Motilal Oswal has cut its consolidated EPS for FY20/21 by 20.4 percent/12 percent, as it cut volumes by 11 percent/5.5 percent to factor in uncertainties in the utility vehicle volumes.

""We cut FY20/21 margins by 130bp/50bp each to 14 percent/13.5 percent due to operating deleverage and BS6 challenge and also factoring in the corporate tax rate cut benefits,"" said the brokerage, which maintained a buy call on the stock."

With the declining sales figures of the auto industry, people have started to prefer leasing out cars instead of buying them outright and carmakers are giving them just that.

This way, a person can have the joy of driving their preferred vehicle to their heart’s content, without having to bear the liabilities of ownership. Following Mahindra’s footsteps, Honda India has also begun offering some of its models for lease after tying up with Orix India.

So, with manufacturers like these offering their cars on lease, what options do you have for renting a car? Have a look.

1. Mahindra SYouV

Indian automobile manufacturer Mahindra has launched its own subscription-based service for private vehicles. Beginning service in eight major Indian cities, the company aims to let more people experience Mahindra SUVs without having a load of purchasing the vehicle.

The company has tied up with Revv to launch its service in Delhi (NCR), Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Chandigarh, and Ahmedabad in the beginning. However, the company plans to extend its reach soon. This plan allows the user to lease a vehicle on a subscription basis with plans starting at Rs 19,720 per month.

2. Honda India and ORIX

Tying up with Japan’s leading car leasing company Orix, Honda Cars India Ltd. has begun leasing its cars via the car leasing company’s website and app. These cars can be availed by self-employed professionals, businessmen, and salaried individuals.

The company is offering its CR-V, Civic and City models to choose from. The company aims to cater to both corporate as well as individual customers.

3. Hyundai subscription

One of the most well-faring brands in India, Korean automaker Hyundai too joined the bandwagon of leasing cars. The models on offer include the Grand i10, Xcent, Elite i20, Creta, Santro, Verna, and the Venue.

While most cars are offered with an option of a manual and automatic transmission, the Venue is offered only with an automatic gearbox. The car can be leased for upto 4 years, with a minimum lock-in period of 12 months. The cars can be subscribed on a monthly basis or a yearly contract.

4. Zoomcar

Zoomcar is one of India’s premier car-rental services which has been operating since February 2013. With its headquarters in Bangalore, Zoomcar provides services across 45 cities in India.

The much-awaited SUV's base model will retail for Rs 9.80 lakh (ex-showroom) in India. Here are other details you need to know about the car. (Image source: Mahindra)

Mahindra put its iconic first-gen Thar to rest when it launched the special edition Thar 700. However, the Indian automobile manufacturer is already preparing to bring back the Thar in its second-generation.

The car was recently spied under testing on Indian roads. Though it was under heavy camouflage, its increased size and prominent bulk were evident. Mahindra also seems to have carried forward its iconic 7-slat grille, round headlamps, and the upright stance. It also gets beefier wheels and wheel arches to complement its increased size. The rear was spotted with a pair of vertically stacked taillamps.

The Thar was spotted in a hard-top form, which could suggest that Mahindra will offer the new Thar in different variants. The interior has been updated with a new dashboard, while the seats have improved visually and now come with additional bolstering for more comfort and support. It also gets a new instrument cluster, which is expected to get a bigger multi-info display.

Though it has not been officially confirmed yet, it is expected that Mahindra will equip the car with front power windows, multi-info display, manual HVAC, fabric seats, an audio system, and steering wheel-mounted audio controls. It could also get additional safety features such as dual airbags, ABS with EBD, rear parking sensors, driver and co-driver seatbelt warning, and a high-speed alert system.

Mahindra is expected to equip the 2020 Thar with a brand-new BSVI compliant 2-litre diesel engine. It should make around 140 PS of maximum power and 320 Nm of peak torque. It should be mated to a 6-speed low range manual gearbox which will send power to all four wheels.

The company is expected to unveil the second-generation Thar at the upcoming Auto Expo in 2020. It could carry a higher price tag than its predecessor, considering its upgrades. Currently, the Thar 700 has a price tag of Rs 9.99 lakh (ex-showroom)."

Indian markets witnessed a selloff in the morning trade on September 3, weighed down by both local and global cues.

The Sensex ended 769.88 points lower at 36,562.91, while Nifty was down 225.40 points or 2.04% at 10,797.90.

Markets were shut on account of Ganesh Chaturthi on September 2 but global markets mostly moved lower on account of the escalating trade war between the US and China.

The Indian market recorded its third consecutive monthly fall but on a weekly basis, both the Sensex and the Nifty closed with gains of around 2 percent. The Nifty gained 1.79 percent and the Sensex rose 1.72 percent in August.

On a monthly basis, the Sensex fell 0.4 percent, while the Nifty was down by 0.85 percent. The Nifty dropped 5.6 percent in July and 1.12 percent in June.

A list of Top 5 factors that could weigh on markets on September 3:

GDP growth at 6-year low

India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5 percent in April-June 2019, official data released on August 30 showed, confirming fears of a slowdown as the government announced a second set of measures to boost the economy. The GDP growth was at 8 percent in the same quarter of 2018-19.

Gross value added (GVA), which is GDP minus taxes, and, therefore, a more realistic proxy to measure economic activity, grew 4.9 percent in April-June, compared to 7.7 percent in the same period in 2018 and 5.7 percent in January-March this year.

India's economic growth dropping to an over six-year low indicates a ""significant deceleration"" in both investment and consumer demand, industry body Ficci said on August 31.

""The move is definitely positive for PSU banks and could improve markets. However, the release of GDP growth data at 5 percent is well below market expectations and could be taken negatively by the markets,"" Ajit Mishra, Vice President, Religare Broking, told Moneycontrol.

""Hence, although we believe the recent measures announced by the government are positive for the markets. However, the upside would be capped until there are meaningful signs of revival in the economy,"" he said.

US-China tariff war adds to gloom

US President Donald Trump slapped 15 percent tariffs on a variety of Chinese goods, including footwear, smart watches and flat-panel televisions, on September 1, while China imposed new duties on US crude, the latest escalation in a bruising trade war, Reuters reported.

China's State Council has said it will increase adjustments of economic policy. A private survey on September 2 showed factory activity unexpectedly expanded in August, though gains were modest and contrasted with official data that pointed to further contraction, added the report.

In retaliation, China started to impose additional tariffs on some of the US goods on a $75 billion target list. Beijing did not specify the value of the goods that face higher tariffs from September 1.

FPIs net sellers for second straight month

Foreign investors pulled out Rs 5,920 crore from the Indian capital markets in August even though the government rolled back enhanced surcharge on foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).

According to the latest depositories data, FPIs withdrew Rs 17,592.28 crore from equities and pumped in a net sum of Rs 11,672.26 crore in the debt segment, translating into a total net outflow of Rs 5,920.02 crore during August 1 - 30, said a PTI report.

""The FPI clause which levied a higher surcharge was one big factor which, along with the LTCG tax last year, contributed to this regular outflow. While one part has already been relaxed, we can expect some relaxation on LTCG tax. This can probably be done by placing it on par with the calculation of immovable assets by increasing the non-taxable tenure to 3 years (true long term), as is already being rumoured on the Street,"" Vinay Pandit, Head, Institutional Equities, IndiaNivesh, told Moneycontrol.

Muted auto sales data

Automakers which released their sales data for August have shown a double-digit decline. Most global brokerage firms suggest that a cut in goods and services tax (GST) rates could help boost demand.

Morgan Stanley is of the view that any cut in GST rate will have a direct impact on end-consumer prices. “If GST were cut to 24 percent, this would likely help demand,” it said.

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) sold 36,085 units (domestic + export) in the month of August 2019, a drop of 25 percent from August 2018 sale of 48,324 units.

Maruti Suzuki India sold 1,06,413 units in August 2019, a drop of 32.7 percent from August 2018 sale of 1,58,189 units.

Homegrown auto major Tata Motors on September 1 reported a 58% decline in its domestic passenger vehicle sales at 7,316 units in August. In the commercial vehicles segment, its sales were down 45% at 21,824 units as against 39,859 units in August 2018.

GST collections below Rs 1 lakh cr

India's gross GST collections slipped below Rs 1 lakh crore to Rs 98,202 crore in August, according to official data released on September 1. Gross revenue collections from GST in July stood at Rs 1.02 lakh crore.

A fall in GST collection will weigh on the fiscal roadmap of the government. Fiscal deficit touched Rs 5.47 lakh crore in the June quarter, which is 77.8 percent of the budget estimate for 2019-20.

PSB Merger: Too much of too little

Last week, government announced its plans to further consolidate the PSU banking space, as well as a set of measures to improve governance practices and additional details on fund infusion in PSBs.

The move was long expected, given that it is based on recommendations of the PJ Nayak Committee back in 2014, and the precedent set by the 3-way of merger of BOB, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank in Sept-18. With the merger of: Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India, Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank, Union Bank, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank, Indian Bank and Allahabad Bank.

""The merger marathon will benefit in theory, only in the long run. Further, we believe that this move will do little to directly strengthen PSBs and revive their credit growth in order to provide the intended stimulus. This is because it does not directly address core issues that have plagued most PSBs, which will take a long time to address,"" Aakash Dattani, Analyst, HDFC Securities."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

MM's 1QFY20 performance exceeded expectations on all grounds, with standalone (S/A) EBITDA margins at 12.6% (PLe: 12%). We believe, not only MM is highly exposed to BS6 transition and related cost increase challenge (with ~90% of its product portfolio is diesel dependent) but also increasing competion in its core forte (UV2 segment due to MG) to also dent auto segment performance. Additionally, with tractor segment contribution is expected to decline over FY20/21, margin profile too is expected to deteriorate with S/A FY20/21 margins at 12.3%/11.7%.

Outlook

With significant correction in valuations, we downgrade the stock to Hold with price target of INR547 (based in 12x Mar'21E core PE plus value of investment in key subsidiaries).

Mahindra and Mahindra on August 7 reported adjusted net profit at Rs 892.7 crore for the June quarter, a 29 percent year-on-year drop due to weak demand across segments. Numbers include those of Mahindra Vehicle Manufacturers, a 100 percent subsidiary of M&M.

The bottomline missed analysts’ expectations, as profit was pegged at Rs 1,032 crore, according to a poll of analysts conducted by CNBC-TV18.

Profit in the corresponding period last fiscal stood at Rs 1,257.22 crore. The reported Q1 profit was Rs 2,259.7 crore, showing an 80 percent growth YoY due to one-time (exceptional) gain of Rs 1,367 crore.

The exceptional income was mainly due to gain on sale of shares by M&M benefit trust and income on buy back by an associate/transfer of certain long-term investments, M&M said in a BSE filing.

The June quarter revenue grew by 4.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 12,805.5 crore, with 5 percent YoY decline in auto sales and 15 percent fall in tractors segment.

""For the passenger vehicle (PV) segment, Q1FY20 is the fourth consecutive quarter of reduction, the worst ever de-growth since Q3FY01. PV demand continues to be impacted by the slowing down of the overall economy, which along with tight credit conditions and delayed monsoon has impacted consumer sentiment in both urban and rural India,"" M&M said.

For Q1, the Indian auto industry sales fell 12.3 percent, with all segments reporting a decline, the company said. It is after six years that all segments of the industry have posted a reduction in the same quarter.

At operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), fell by 15 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,794 crore and margin contracted by 180bps YoY to 14 percent in Q1, which were largely in line with estimates.

Auto segment revenue fell 0.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 7,986 crore in Q1, with EBIT declining sharply by 31.6 percent and margin contraction of 290bps YoY.

The stress in the agriculture sector and finance availability have impacted the demand for light commercial vehicle 2-3.5T (pik-up segment) and the heavy commercial vehicle segment has posted a de-growth of 32 percent, the worst reduction in 23 quarters, M&M said.

The slowing down of economy coupled with the increase in freight capacity of existing fleet due to new axle loading norms has led to many transporters reducing or temporarily suspending their purchase plans, it said.

Revenue from its farm equipment (tractor) segment dropped 12.5 percent to Rs 4,382 crore and its EBIT plunged 19.2 percent and margin fell 160bps compared to year-ago.

""Tractor demand in Q1FY20 remained sluggish and was adversely impacted due to a weak sentiment in the agri-economy resulting from the delay in southwest monsoon, poor spatial distribution in June and weak agricultural incomes impacted by poor price realisation,"" the company said.

In Q1, the domestic tractor industry declined by 14.6 percent, with sales of 1,91,305 tractors against 2,23,937 in the 2018 June quarter.

The stock has lost more than 40 percent of its value in last one year. It was quoting at Rs 530.95, down Rs 18.35, or 3.34 percent, on the BSE at 1352 hours IST."

Automobile company Mahindra and Mahindra is expected to see a double digit fall in its profit for the June quarter and operating income following subdued volumes. The results will be announced on August 7.

The stock lost 14 percent in the last three months, and 41 percent last year amid a slowdown in volumes over muted demand.

Brokerages expect the company to a report 18-22 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in profit, and more than a 5 percent fall in revenue for the quarter that ended on June 2019 as its volumes declined 9 percent YoY (down 7 percent QoQ) to 2.18 lakh units.

During the quarter, utility vehicle volumes fell 5.9 percent YoY and 3-wheeler volumes increased 1 percent, while tractor volumes plunged 14.3 percent YoY. But brokerages expect realisation to improve by 3-5 percent due to product mix.

""With pick-ups being lower, we expect M&M's standalone revenues to dip 5.4 percent YoY / 9 percent QoQ,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher.

Motilal Oswal, which expects a 20 percent decline in Q1 profit and 7 percent fall in revenue, said it has cut its consolidated EPS estimates for FY20/21 by 12/7 percent as it cut volumes by 9/8 percent to factor in uncertainties in tractor volumes. It also cut margins by 40bps each to 13.9/13.5 percent due to change in mix (from tractor to UVs) and BS6 challenge.

For the quarter that ended in June, most brokerages expect EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to fall around 18 percent and margin to contract in triple digit YoY, dragged partly by lower tractor volumes.

""We expect EBITDA margin to decline by 220 bps due to negative operating leverage,"" said Kotak which sees 18.2 percent YoY decline in Q1 EBITDA and 22 percent fall in profit.

M&M's capex guidance for next three years is Rs 18,000 crore in which Rs 12,000 crore will be used for capacity expansion and product development while Rs 6,000 crore will be used for other investments.

Key issues to watch out for would be outlook for UV and tractor businesses for FY20 and FY21, update on response to the newly launched products, update on average discounts per unit during festivals, and update on new launches and timelines.

One of the followers was a person with a Twitter username 'Highly Placed Source' who replied to Mahindra’s tweet in the most Indian manner. He asked the Indian entrepreneur, “Sir, kitna deti hai?” While this is a common question which Indians ask before purchasing any vehicle, it looked a little out of place considering it was asked for a $2 million all-electric hypercar.Anand Mahindra, however, took it in his stride with the wittiest of replies when he said, “Sirji, electric hai..Shock deti hai!” His reply caught many unawares and resulted in a hilarious twitter thread.The Pininfarina Battista is equipped with four motors, one for each wheel. The motors draw their power from a Rimac-sourced 120kWh battery. This gives the car a 0-100kmph time of 2 seconds, with a top speed of 350kmph. The car can also travel for up to 450km on a single charge. Company tests estimate a power output of 1900PS, with 2300Nm of continuous torque."

Shares of Mahindra and Mahindra fell 1.8 percent intraday slumping to a 4-year low on August 1 after the company reported a double-digit decline in July sales, missing analyst expectations.

The stock lost 18 percent in the last one month to hit a day's low of Rs 540.40, the lowest level since May 2014. It was quoting at Rs 543.95, down Rs 6.30, or 1.14 percent on the BSE at 1242 hours.

The company sold 40,142 units in July 2019, down by 15 percent compared to 47,199 units sold in the same period last year due to a continued slowdown in domestic business. Numbers were below Nomura expectations of 43,400 units.

""The headwinds faced by the automotive industry continue as a result of subdued consumer sentiment, triggered by various factors. The industry needs stimuli to help revive consumer demand and conversions,"" Veejay Ram Nakra, Chief of Sales and Marketing, Automotive Division said.

""We hope that the overall buying sentiment will improve in the run-up to the festive season and with the monsoon turning out to be better than initially anticipated,"" he added.

M&M in its BSE filing said passenger vehicle sales dropped 15 percent to 16,831 units and commercial vehicle sales fell 17 percent to 15,969 units compared to year-ago.

On the tractor business front, the company almost met analyst expectations, saying it sold 19,992 units in July 2019, lower by 12 percent against 22,679 units sold in previous year.

Nomura had expected the company to sell 20,000 tractors in July 2019.

Domestic tractor sales declined 11 percent to 19,174 units and exports fell 26 percent to 818 units compared to the year-ago period.

Mahindra and Mahindra will soon use bots to assess employees' feelings, according to a report by The Economic Times.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

The artificial intelligence (AI)-based bots will conduct random conversations with employees, asking questions such as “How are you feeling?” and “What is making you feel low?”.

The program, called mood-o-meter, will nudge managers to have a conversation with an employee if he or she is feeling unhappy.

“(The problem) is that managers don’t speak to people at the right time. If we can nudge managers to do that, then we can create shifts,” Prince Augustin, an executive vice president at the company, told the paper.

Tech Mahindra, a part of the Mahindra group of companies, introduced similar technology at its Noida Special Economic Zone (SEZ).

Tech Mahindra introduced K2, a human resource (HR) Humanoid, which the company says will aid employee engagement.

The use of AI in human resources is becoming increasingly prominent in India, especially in the recruitment process. The use of AI in gauging employee morale is still in the early stages.

“I see introduction of bots encouraging a more impersonal environment at workplace,” said Pushpendra Priyadarshi, an assistant professor at IIM Lucknow, told The Economic Times."

Homegrown auto major Mahindra and Mahindra June 3 said it is ready to launch its BS VI compliant vehicles next year and will be rolling out the petrol range in 2019 itself.

""We will be ready with our first gasoline BS VI ready vehicles by end of second quarter of this year,"" M&M Managing Director Pawan Goenka told reporters here.

""We would probably be able to launch gasoline vehicles as soon as we are ready because it does not require a BS VI fuel, but we will not be able to launch the diesel vehicle till the fuel becomes available throughout India. I am assuming it to be somewhere in late December and early January,"" Goenka said.

The Bharat Stage VI (or BS-VI) emission norms would come into force from April 1, 2020 across the country. Currently, the vehicles sold in the country conform to BS-IV emission standards.

The company has invested Rs 1,000 crore for transition to BS VI norms.

He said ramping up and down the entire volume of the automotive business in next 2-3 months is a humongous challenge for suppliers and also for the plants.

Last 3.5 years have perhaps been the most challenging years for any product development and sourcing organization in auto industry in India, he said, adding that nearly 700 people worked over the last 3.5 years to make BS VI happen.

""We are ready and we see no technical risk in taking BS VI vehicles to the market from April 1, 2020. We are ready because we got an early start, plan, front loading and work with key suppliers,"" Goenka said.

All technological challenges that were known were negated, he added.

""This time we had two levels of upgradation, there is a fear of compromise in fuel efficiency, performance of vehicle, drivability, NVH but we have ensured none of these were compromised in implementation of BS VI,"" Goenka said.

In fact in some cases, the company has improved on some of these parameters. In some sense, the challenge of BS VI became an opportunity for giving a slightly better product in terms of all these parameters, he said.

Goenka said the team was given two challenges at that time. First challenge was the target, which was non-negotiable, but with competitive cost on diesel portfolio.

The second challenge which was more relevant in Mahindra's context was that Mahindra was not known for its gasoline engine but its diesel engine.

Therefore the second challenge was to develop a portfolio of petrol engines which are globally competent.

""In fact, given that we had no petrol engine at that time we probably had an advantage that the petrol engines that we would launch would be the latest technology products,"" he said.

The company has filed over 30 patents in the process of the transition.

On petrol engine, Goenka said,"" we have a stamp of approval from both Ford and SsangYong. They have decided to use Mahindra's new petrol engine in their vehicles which means we have managed to develop engine which are globally competitive""."

Highlights:

- Decent volume growth in auto segment whereas farm equipment segment remained weak

- Operating profitability under pressure due to rise in raw material prices

- Moderate outlook for tractor segment, near-term weakness in auto segment

- Accumulate in staggered manner --------------------------------------------------

A weak demand environment in automotive and farm equipment segments has impacted performance of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M). The automaker posted mid-single digit growth in top line and saw contraction in operating profitability.

The company is trying to hook investors for the long term on the back of its strong leadership in farm equipment segment (FES), the government’s focus on rural growth, a slew of new auto launches and reasonable valuation.

Quarter in a snapshot

Key highlightsHit by subdued demand owing to multiple challenges being faced by automobile and farm equipment (FES) industries, the company saw a decline of 0.4 percent in volume year-on-year (YoY). Tractor volume took a knock of 14.5 percent, which got partially offset by 7.2 percent growth in UV (utility vehicle) volume. Tractor segment came under pressure after lower than expected Rabi sowing and subdued farm sentiment. Realisation, however, grew 5.1 percent YoY, driven by lower discounts in the quarter, especially in the auto space, which ticked up 6 percent on lower discounts.

The overall earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin contracted by 160 bps (YoY). The contraction was on the back of significant rise in raw material (RM) prices. However, lower other and staff expenses partially offset the impact of the rise in RM prices.

Automotive segment’s EBIT margin fell by 170 bps, weighed down by higher RM prices. FES segment’s margin contracted by 330 bps.

M&M also reported an exceptional loss of Rs 105 crore related to provision for impairment of certain investments.

Following are the factors that give us comfort on the company:

FES – A positive outlookThe company has been the market leader in tractors with a market share of 36.4 percent. The leadership is primarily attributed to its product innovations.

Though the segment has not been doing well in the past couple of months due to lower Rabi sowing than expected and subdued farm sentiments, the management expects it to grow 5 percent in FY20, steered by growth in H2 FY20. It believes that H1 FY20 would be muted for the tractor industry as the medium-term growth outlook, however, is pegged at 8-10 percent. The management is of the view that M&M would be able to do better than the industry on the back of its large exposure to rural and semi-urban areas.

Automotive segment – Sluggish in near termDemand outlook for the automobile segment continues to be muted due to multiple factors such as increasing cost of total ownership on the back to rising interest rate and insurance cost, coupled with weaker festive sales and liquidity crunch. The demand is expected to be sluggish in the near term. However, long-term outlook continues to be very positive.

With the new launches, M&M remains on a strong footing. In fact, M&M has a portfolio of successful products such as Scorpio and XUV500 in UV segment. The response to its newly-launched Marazzo, Alturas G4 and XUV300 has been very encouraging.

Attractive valuationThe underperformance of the stock, which corrected 33 percent from the 52-week high in August 2018, has rendered the valuation attractive. Sum-of-the-Parts (SOTP) valuation methodology gives 26 percent upside potential. We advise long-term investors to accumulate M&M for the long term.

Mahindra and Mahindra shares fell 2 percent intraday on May 30 after waning tractor demand and sharp fall in legacy SUV volumes hit operating earnings in Q4.

Hence, most global brokerage houses slashed price target. CLSA downgraded the stock and cut target price by 19 percent on likely underperformance.

The stock was quoting at Rs 659.50, down Rs 12.75, or 1.90 percent on the BSE at 1220 hours IST.

M&M's profit fell 16 percent as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation dropped 6.4 percent with margin contraction of 160 bps in the quarter ended March 2019 YoY, dragged by tractor business.

Farm equipment segment continued to struggle with margin falling for the third consecutive quarter. Tractor business declined 13.4 percent YoY with its EBIT falling 28 percent and margin down 330 bps in Q4 while the auto segment registered a 12 percent growth YoY with margin expansion of 80 bps.

Management guided for a single-digit growth (5 percent) in tractors in FY20 and expects a decline in tractor industry in Q1. The dealer inventory of tractors is at 4-5 weeks, which is largely within range, it said, adding BS-6 preparation is on track.

Here is what brokerages say about M&M earnings:

Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Underperform | Target: Rs 690 | Return: 3 percent

M&M's operational outlook has deteriorated, led by weakening tractor industry demand and a sharp fall in legacy SUV volumes eating into the benefit of new launches. Its higher exposure to diesel also makes it more vulnerable to upcoming emission norms.

After 10-13 percent volume and EPS CAGR in the past three years, we see a muted 2 percent volume CAGR and a 12 percent EPS decline over FY19-21. We cut FY20-21CL EPS by 14-19 percent and are 17-28 percent below consensus. Its 11.4x FY21CL auto PE is undemanding, but the stock is unlikely to perform given multiple headwinds.

We downgraded from buy to underperform and cut target price from Rs 850 to Rs 690.

Brokerage: Citi | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 720 | Return: 7 percent

We maintain neutral stance on the stock and have slashed price target to Rs 720 from Rs 740 as peaking tractor cycle made it difficult to be positive.

We increased FY20/21 EBITDA estimates by 1-2 percent but cut FY21 PAT estimate by 2 percent.

Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Hold | Target: Rs 780 | Return: 16 percent

We have a hold rating on the stock with a target price at Rs 780. We build in 10 percent decline in domestic tractor volumes for FY20.

This was the 21st appearance of Tata Motors at the annual Geneva Motor Show. From showcasing the Indica back in 1998 which announced the entry of Tata Motors in the cars space, the company revealed no less than four new products at this year's show. Where one company is embracing new products one other company is bidding adieu to an iconic model. More on this later in the copy. Here's a look at what made headlines in the auto space during the week.

Honda launches Civic at Rs 17.69 lakh

Six years after it last produced the Civic saloon from its factory in Uttar Pradesh, Honda Cars India on March 7 relaunched the premium sedan in a bid to excite brand loyalists and boost its image amid surging competition. The Delhi-based company has launched the Civic at Rs 17.69 lakh (base variant, ex-showroom).

The top-end petrol variant of the Civic is priced at Rs 20.99 lakh, while the base variant of the diesel version is priced at Rs 20.49 lakh. The top-end diesel version is priced at Rs 22.29 lakh (all prices ex-showroom). The 10th generation Civic is one of Honda's longest-running automotive nameplates besides being the largest-selling model globally.

Tata Motors, Mahindra unveil new products at Geneva

Tata Motors on March 5 unveiled four products, including premium hatchback Altroz and a concept version of small SUV H2X, at the Geneva Motor show. The company took curtains off an electric version of Altroz hatchback as well, which it plans to launch next year.

Italian hypercar manufacturer Pininfarina has finally unveiled the latest model in their lineup, the Battista. Posing as an electric hypercar, it borrows a lot of elements from its siblings and fellow Italian supercars. The Mahindra-owned company has two variations of the Battista on display at the Geneva Motor

Wagon R CNG launched at Rs 4.84 lakh

Maruti Suzuki India on March 6 launched two CNG variants of its newly launched hatchback WagonR priced at Rs 4.84 lakh and Rs 4.89 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).

The factory fitted WagonR S-CNG will be available in Lxi and Lxi(O) variants powered by 1 litre engine and priced at Rs 4.84 lakh and Rs 4.89 lakh, respectively, the company said in a statement.

Passenger vehicles sales decline by 1.1 percent in Feb

Domestic passenger vehicle (PV) sales declined 1.11 percent to 2,72, 284 units in February from 2,75,346 units in the same month the previous year.

Domestic car sales were also down 4.33 percent at 1,71,372 units as compared to 1,79,122 units in February 2018, according to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).

Ashok Leyland bags bus order

Ashok Leyland has bagged an order from the Gujarat State Roadways Corporation for 1,290 buses. At present, the Chennai-based commercial vehicle maker is the fourth largest bus manufacturer globally.

This order comes on the heels of the Hinduja flagship bagging 2,580 bus orders from various state transport undertakings recently, the company said

VW slapped with Rs 500 crore fine

Volkswagen will challenge a ruling by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that imposed a fine of $71 million on the German carmaker for emission violations.

An investigation by the government in 2015 found that Volkswagen had flouted local pollution limits and the company was forced to recall 323,700 cars in the country. That ruling came two months after it admitted to cheating US diesel emissions tests.

Maruti bids adieu to Gypsy

Thirty three years after the first Gypsy was rolled out from the production lines of Maruti Udyog's (as known then) plant in Haryana, the Delhi-based car market leader has pulled the plug on India's iconic model of all time.

It is one of the two models (the other being Omni) that Maruti Suzuki has decided not to invest in for upgradation to Bharat Stage VI emission and crash norms set to kick-in this year and next.

Through constant upgradation of product portfolio including the launch of Baleno, Brezza and Dzire, the Gypsy had become the oldest model to be untouched by Maruti Suzuki's engineers.

Known for its rugged, ready-to-go-off-road look, the Gypsy gave birth to the sports utility vehicle segment in India. Loved by Bollywood and owned by several by its celebrities, the Gypsy was the most preferred vehicle for buyers who did not wish to buy the cramped M800 or the boxy Omni or even the built-like-a-tank Ambassador.

The Gypsy even became the primary choice for India's armed forces thanks to its versatile character and easy-to-fix mechanicals. It was lightweight to the extent that a Dhruv helicopter could lift it and transport it anywhere. The iconic army-specific green shade on the Gypsy became an instant hit with the vehicle's loyalist.

Tata Motors offered the Safari Storme to the Indian Army as an alternative to the Gypsy and it subsequently won supply contracts. This was the beginning of the end of the Gypsy.

While the hard top version of the Maruti vehicle qualified to be called as an SUV the soft top version became more popular since it gave the owners the freedom to roll down the cover and enjoy the open top. No other car maker was able to emulate this stand-out feature until Mahindra and Mahindra launched the soft top version of the Thar. However, Thar's sales have been nowhere close to that of the Gypsy.

Maruti Suzuki has lined up quite a few models for the future and some of them will be in the SUV segment. However, there seems to be no replacement in sight for the Gypsy as of now. The brand, however, will live on like the Tata Indica, which too walked into the sunset a few years ago."
"March 03, 2019 10:50 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/fame-ii-to-help-accelerate-ev-launches-mahindra-3602731.html,"Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) plans to accelerate launch of electric vehicles (EVs) in the wake of government clearing a Rs 10,000-crore programme under the FAME-II scheme, a top company official said.

The company, which currently sells e2oPlus and eVerito EVs in the passenger vehicle segment, has set up an electric technology manufacturing hub in Bengaluru with an investment of Rs 100 crore.

M&M is also expanding its Chakan (Pune) plant at an investment of Rs 450 crore to enhance its EV portfolio.

""With the announcement of FAME II, we would now accelerate that investment and try and launch our products as quickly as we can,"" M&M Managing Director Pawan Goenka told PTI.

M&M has earmarked a total outlay of Rs 900 crore for EV vertical. Apart from Rs 450 crore investment in Chakan, the company is also putting in another Rs 350 crore for a new R&D centre in Bengaluru.

""We have started establishing a plant in Chakan in Pune, and we will just accelerate that investment now to bring it as fast as possible,"" Goenka said.

With now FAME II scheme in place, he said, the company expects to get higher volumes enabling it to localise its products further.

""The main thing is that we need to do more investment for localising so that we are able to promote Make in India through electric vehicles,"" Goenka said.

The company would look at localising the motor which goes into EVs, the power electronics and the battery, he added.

In the 2018 auto show, M&M had unveiled six electric concept vehicles and models. The company had displayed e-KUV100, an electric version of its compact vehicle KUV100; UDO, a concept two-seater electric mobility pod; ATOM, a last-mile urban mobility concept vehicle; and a lithium ion battery-powered three-wheeler Treo that has already hit the markets.

It had also displayed e-COSMO electric bus and e2o NXT, which is a refreshed version of its electric small car e2oPlus. In the CV space, the company sells electric products like eSupro, Treo and e-Alfa Mini three-wheelers. Last week, the Union Cabinet cleared a Rs 10,000-crore programme under the FAME-II scheme.

The scheme will be implemented over a period of three years with effect from April 1, 2019. It is the expanded version of the present scheme FAME India I (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) and Electric Vehicles (FAME) which was launched on April 1, 2015, with a total outlay of Rs 895 crore.

The main objective of the scheme is to encourage faster adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles by way of offering upfront incentive on purchase of electric vehicles and also by way of establishing necessary charging infrastructure for EV."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M's performance over Q3FY19 missed our estimates, with operating margins at 12.4%, as against PLe of 13.3%. The recently launched Marazzo has been received well, with order book currently at ~13k units, however the overall decline in overall passenger car market especially in the UV segment has hampered M&M's existing UV portfolio. M&M's Tractor and Pick-up segment continue to do well, however the rural demand has been a little tepid in comparison to H1FY19 and after a high double digit growth over the last 30 months we expect demand to slow down a tad, we reduce our FY19E tractor volume estimates to 1o% (earlier 14% YoY). In the near term we expect margins to be under pressure due to the upcoming UV launches (S201, Alturas) in H2FY19, however for the longer term up-tick in margins largely depends on the success of these models as they would not only boost volume growth but provide operating leverage benefits as well. Increased government focus on rural economy could further accelerate growth for both, Farm and Auto segment.

Outlook

We maintain 'BUY' with a price target of Rs878 (earlier Rs984), based on a core PE of 15x Sep'21E and value of subsidiaries at Rs268.

Sectors like rural consumption, infrastructure development like capital goods, autos, FMCG and Consumer durables are likely to benefit from the Budget, Vivek Ranjan Misra, Head of Fundamental Research at Karvy, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

We expect it to be more than a routine Vote On Account. The government may make announcements in order to please rural voters and the urban middle class, he added.

Edited excerpt:

Q) What are your expectations from the upcoming Interim Budget? Arun Jaitley has already highlighted that it would be more than just Vote on Account.

A) By all accounts, we expect it to be more than a routine Vote On Account. Until now, the government has followed a path of fiscal prudence, this being an election year, the government may make announcements in order to please rural voters and the urban middle class. These could include cash transfers and some changes in the income tax slabs.

Q) Most experts are of the view that government might not be able to meet its fiscal deficit target. Do you think we could see a knee-jerk reaction due to that?

A) GST collections do indicate that meeting the fiscal deficit target will be tough. We believe that the slippages will be minor. The government will attempt to keep the slippage low either by expenditure control, which is most likely to be met by controlling capex. Also the government may ask PSU to hike dividends.

Q) The FM recently said that the government would address issues confronting the farm sector. Those changes would be good for consumption but not necessarily fiscal deficit. What kind of SOPS are you factoring in your estimates?

A) Firstly, the farm sector needs structural reforms that would take time to have an impact. However, some steps to alleviate stress are highly likely.

The PM has rules out farm loan waivers. The most likely step would be a cash transfer, which may be in lieu of subsidies. The mechanism could be via DBT or using Kisan Credit Card.

Certain other measures are likely, like changes in crop insurance scheme. Universal Basic Income (or UBI) may figure in party manifestos, but given the short period is unlikely.

Q) What are your views on the biggies which have come out with their results for Q3 such as RIL, HUL, Wipro as well as HDFC Bank?

A) Results have largely been in line, we do expect that as the earnings season progress, earnings in the quarter are likely to be a bit subdued, as margins are likely to be squeezed due to higher raw material prices, while raw material prices have declined since mid November, this may help boost margins in the next quarter i.e. Q4FY2018-19.

Q) What according to you should be ideal portfolio allocation ahead of Budget?

A) Our portfolio allocation is driven by our outlook for 2019. Overall, we expect that equities will be a bit subdued ahead of the election, but if a stable, reform-oriented government were to assume power, equities could do well in the second half.

We believe conditions are in place for an earnings recovery and the banking sector is past its worst, and this would support a rally.

Q) Historically, which are the sectors that have been in limelight ahead of the Budget and what are you recommending your clients and why?

A) Sectors which could benefit from the budget - those tied to rural consumption or infrastructure development- 1) capital goods, 2) autos 3) FMCG 4) Consumer durables.

However, our sector recommendations take into account our outlook for 2019 and beyond. Considering the economic cycle, the sectors we are the most bullish on are capital goods and banks.

Q) Any 5 stocks which are likely to benefit the most from the upcoming Budget and why?

A) We like Jain Irrigation as it would be a key beneficiary of a rural focus from the government, Hindustan Unilever, Mahindra and Mahindra, Bajaj Corp, as rural consumption may get a boost. Larsen & Toubro as it may benefit from an infra thrust.

LKP Research's report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M’s standalone Q2FY19 revenues came in line with the street’s expectations at ₹130 bn, growing at 6.6% yoy and falling by 3.9% sequentially. Automotive volumes in the quarter grew by 9.5% yoy and 7.5% qoq on Marazzo launch. FES volumes de-grew by 3.5% yoy and 22.6% sequentially as a moderation was expected on high base and a deficient monsoon. While the auto revenues moved up by 9.5% yoy and 5.5% qoq, FES revenues were up by 1.8% yoy and down by 19.5% qoq. On profitability front, EBITDA margins went down to 12.4% from 14.2% yoy and 13.8% qoq. Auto EBIT margins were sluggish at 5.3% due to higher RM costs and launch costs associated with Marazzo. FES margins zoomed up at 20.1% which was a surprise to us despite higher RM costs. Higher other income (up by 50% yoy) and lower tax rate at 23% (due to deferred tax asset of Rs1.34 bn) led to net profits to be higher at 23.9%, however, adjusted net profits grew by 14% to Rs15.2 bn.

Outlook

Margin performance may remain subdued in H2 on further launch costs, while it may improve in FY20E as the company is bringing tighter control and launch costs will taper off. Price hike would somewhat negate the impact of higher RM costs and launch costs. In view of this, we have reduced our target to Rs 950, which includes Rs291 of subsidiary valuation. Maintain BUY.

Increased government focus on rural economy could further accelerate growth for both, Farm and Auto segment.

Outlook

We maintain 'BUY' with a price target of Rs984 (earlier Rs1156), based on a core PE of 17x Mar'20E and value of subsidiaries at Rs268. The stock currently trades at a core PE of ~14x Mar'20E .

Carmaker Honda Motor is planning to introduce an electric vehicle in the Indian market by 2023-24, sources told The Economic Times.

India is an integral part of the Japanese company's global electric vehicle rollout plan, which will take form in 2019 with China.

While the company will launch a 'B' segment vehicle in India, it is still gathering information for specific requirements in the market here, sources told the paper.

""While the government is yet to roll out its electric vehicle policy, unlike the past, Honda is not waiting for these changes to define its electrified vehicles footprint. While the hybrid solution on City sedan is defined, the EV solution for a B segment car or an SUV is a part of the plan,"" a source was quoted as saying.

The Indian arm of the company, Honda Cars India, has always been dependent on petrol-fueled cars. Its entry into small and diesel-fueled cars segment was also late, setting it back in India's competitive automotive market.

The company wants to avoid a similar situation in EVs and green mobility solutions. It did not specify any timeline for the launch of the project.

The model will be a city car and should have a range of 150-200 km. The company is also looking at localising the hybrid solution in India to ensure that it is accessible and affordable to buyers.

Honda is still late to the party as its competitors Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra and Mahindra and Tata Motors have already announced their plans to go green and manufacture EVs in the coming years."

New axle norm introduced by the government is slowing down the market as it has given an opportunity for the truckers to load more on the same truck, said Rajan Wadhera, President, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M).

""There will be some slowdown on account of sweating the assets little more, so there will be some drop because of that (axle norms),"" Wadhera told CNBC-TV18 on the sidelines of the launch of their new fuel-efficient 'Blazo X’ range of heavy-duty trucks.

Considering the number of infrastructure projects that are there in the country, customers will definitely need more truck, so there will growth, he said.

In July, the government had increased the load carrying capacities of heavy vehicles, including trucks, by 20-25 percent at par with global standards.

Besides, the requirement for annual fitness certificates for trucks have been done away with and these certificates need to be only renewed every two years.

On BS-VI, Wadhera said, ""People still run BS-II and BS-III trucks so this is an opportunity for all them to change over to either a BS-IV or they will have to move to BS-VI which will come with associated costs and the lower disposal cost of a BS-II or BS-III.""

""I don’t see a very big drop for the commercial vehicle industry, he said.

Sharekhan's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M has raised the ante in the new utility vehicle (UV) launches, with plans to launch three products in the space. Of these, two launches would be in white spaces (where M&M has no presence), leading to market share gains. The company recently launched Marazzo MPV (priced Rs. 9.99 lakh), marking its entry in the MPV space. The company will also enter the compact UV space with the launch of S201 UV in Q4FY2019 (based on the highly successful Korean subsidiary ‘Tivoli’ platform). Further, M&M would launch the nine-seater XUV7OO (extended version of XUV5OO in the premium UV category) in October 2018. Between the three new models, M&M is aiming to garner volumes of 9,000 units/month compared to the UV industry’s size of about 80,000 units. Launches in new areas will enable M&M to outpace the industry. We are factoring at least 3-4% market share regain by M&M. M&M’s market share has nose-dived to ~25% (Q4FY2018) from ~40% (FY2016). The new launches will enable M&M to recoup its market position to a certain extent.

Outlook

We retain Buy recommendation on M&M with a revised PT of Rs 1075. M&M remains our preferred pick in the auto segment.

A US regulator said on Tuesday it would launch an investigation into an off-road utility vehicle produced by Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd following a complaint by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV that it infringed upon the intellectual property rights of its Jeep design.

The US International Trade Commission (ITC) said in a statement that it was launching a patent-related investigation into the Indian automaker's ROXOR vehicle.

The ITC said the complaint was related to the import and sale in the United States of certain motorized vehicles and components that Fiat Chrysler had alleged infringed on its trademarks. The agency said it would aim to complete its probe within 45 days.

The ITC has indicated it will begin an investigation of Fiat Chrysler's complaint and that it will also be conducting a 100-day expedited consideration of the 2009 agreement and its effect on the investigation, said Rich Ansell, vice president of marketing, Mahindra Automotive North America.

Fiat Chrysler could not immediately be reached for comment.

Last month, Mahindra said that Fiat Chrysler had filed a patent violation complaint with the ITC against the company and called the complaint without merit.

Mahindra said that it and its North American unit had filed a public interest statement with the ITC and had begun proceedings in a Michigan court to enforce a design agreement that it had executed with Fiat Chrysler in 2009.

Mahindra was seeking an injunction against Fiat Chrysler from proceeding with the complaint, it added.

Fiat Chrysler had not made a monetary claim in the complaint but was seeking to block Mahindra Automotive from importing any parts or components into the United States that infringe upon Fiat Chrysler's intellectual property rights, it said."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

We are increasing FY19 and FY20 EPS by 2.6-2.7% and target price to Rs1156 (Rs1075 earlier) after attending the unveiling of Mahindra's shark-inspired MPV 'Marazzo' at Nasik plant yesterday. The Marazzo slots perfectly between the Maruti's Ertiga and Toyota's Innova Crysta, with the base variant M2 starting at Rs9.9L and going up to Rs13.9L for the top end M8. Marazzo is Mahindra's first globally engineered product developed between its MANA (Detroit) and MRV (Chennai) facilities and it sets new standards for refinement, ease of use, comfort and a significant improvement to the earlier launches. We factor in monthly sales at 3k units (Ertiga & Innvoa Crysta selling 4-6K units per month) and increase our EBITDA margins by 30bps for FY19/20. Management expects the Marazzo, S201 & Y400 (to be launched later this year) to have a combined monthly run-rate of 8-9K units (capacity of 1.5L/annum) which will provide much needed volume boost and improve profitability . Retain Buy.

Outlook

We increase our EBITDA margins for FY19/20 by 30bps on account of increased operating leverage benefits and prudent pricing actions and maintain 'BUY' with a price target of Rs1,156, based on a core PE of 18x Mar'20E (earlier 17x) and value of subsidiaries at Rs288/share.

Nitin AgrawalMoneycontrol Research

Automobile players posted a mixed set of sales for August on the back of delayed festive season and floods in Kerala. The commercial vehicle (CV) segment continues to remain strong on the back of a normal monsoon, improved rural sentiment and investment in infrastructure. Tractors and two-wheeler (2W) sales were hit by a delayed festive season. The outlook for the same continues to remain positive on the back of a revival in the rural economy and normal monsoon.

Three-wheeler (3W) sales continue to zoom given the government’s decision to end Permit Raj. There has also been a strong pick-up in exports on the back of an improving global climate.

Strong showing by CVsDespite uncertainty around the new axle load norms, CVs continue to remain buoyant given the government's increasing focus on infrastructure, construction demand and increase in mining activities.

The light commercial vehicle (LCV) segment, in particular, continues to show a strong uptrend in monthly numbers primarily because of increased thrust on agriculture, FMCG and e-commerce sectors and increasing demand accruing from container and refrigerated trucks.

Tata Motors registered a significant growth on the back of reasons stated above. The medium and heavy commercial vehicle (M&HCV) segment continued its robust performance in the backdrop of strong GDP growth (8.2 percent) in the April-June quarter. Replacement buying and various infrastructure projects continue to lead to strong demand for higher tonnage trucks and tippers.

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) posted healthy growth thanks to its rural penetration. The management expects growth momentum to continue on the back of some recent refresh launches as well as the better performance by its product portfolio.

Eicher Volvo also witnessed significant year-on-year (YoY) growth of 32.8 percent in August. Ashok Leyland continued to deliver strong YoY growth at 28 percent.

Cars segment: Leader hit by floodsSegment leader, Maruti Suzuki, saw domestic volumes decline 2.8 percent due of its large exposure (around 11 percent) to Kerala. The new Ciaz is gaining traction and witnessed a growth of 8.4 percent.

For Tata Motors, its passenger (PV) and utility vehicle (UV) segments grew 28 percent and 122.8 percent, respectively, thanks to strong demand for Tiago, Tigor, Hexa and Nexon.

M&M posted flat volume growth. The management hopes to see buoyancy in PV sales with the launch of the Marazzo.

Bajaj Auto: Gaining momentum in the 2W spaceIn the 2W space, Bajaj Auto is the market leader in August, clocking a growth of 27.2 percent.

Eicher posted a meagre 2.1 percent YoY growth in volumes due to the Kerala floods. TVS Motor Company and Hero MotoCorp were impacted by a delayed festive season.

Steller showing by three-wheeler manufacturersThe overall three-wheeler (3W) market continues to gain strength after the end of the Permit Raj. Bajaj Auto, the leader in this space, posted a growth of 28.3 percent. The same for TVS and M&M stood at 56.1 percent and 35.4 percent, respectively.

Tractors gaining on positive rural sentimentDelayed festive season has impacted sales of tractors. However, revival of the rural economy and expectations of a normal monsoon would continue to augur well for companies in this space. Recent initiatives from the government to usher strength into rural India should continue to support demand for farm equipment like tractors.

Escorts and M&M posted a YoY growth of 9.4 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively.

Exports reviveAuto companies have been struggling in the export market for long. Overall revival in the global economy is finally reflecting in the numbers of some of the leading automobile exporters. All auto majors, barring Maruti and Escorts, posted strong YoY growth in the overseas market.

Mahindra officially revealed their latest flagship, the Y400, at the annual general meeting. Y400 is the internal codename used for the SUV and is expected to be launched by the name of XUV700.

The Y400 is basically a rebadged version of the Ssangyong Rexton G4. It shares a lot of similarities to its donor car, but Mahindra will make a few changes to make it distinguishable. For example, the front grille will sport a new slatted design with the Mahindra logo front and centre and the headlamps and DRLs have also been updated.

The new SUV is expected to be launched sometime around the festival period. The company is also set to launch the Marazzo alongside a sub-4 metre compact SUV before Diwali, this year.

In terms of mechanicals, the XUV700 will sport a 2.2-litre 4-cylinder turbo-diesel producing 181 PS at 4,000 rpm and 420 Nm of peak torque between 1,600 and 2,000 rpm. The transmission will be a 7-speed automatic gearbox.

The 7-seater is expected to sit at the top of Mahindra's range of cars and as such will come with a lot of premium features. Interiors feature leather seats, a 9.2-inch touchscreen infotainment system in the front with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay and WiFi, a 10.1-inch touchscreen for rear passengers and dual-zone automatic climate control. Other features include HID Headlamps, electric sun-roof and flared wheel arches over 5-spoke alloy rims to give it a more aggressive stance.

As for safety, you get nine airbags, ABS, electronic brakeforce distribution, traction control, hill descent control, electronic stability control and advanced emergency braking.

The XUV700 will go up against the likes of the Toyota Fortuner and Ford Endeavour in terms of competition and is expected to be in the price range of Rs 20-25 lakh."

JM Financial's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

On 26 Jun’18, we attended M&M’s Farm Equipment Sector (FES) day, highlighting the upside to Mahindra’s rise strategy, which would be driven by an increase in a) the domestic tractor market share, b) increase in revenue share from global operations, and c) increase in revenue from the farm machinery category. The company intends to increase its domestic tractor market share from 43% to 50%, supported by the new affordable “Trackstar” brand, mechanisation of the horticulture segment and growth in the high horsepower (hp) segment. The company views its current global market share of <2%, favourably and as an opportunity to increase its revenue from global operations from 37% currently to 50% in the next 2-3 years, supported by its operations in the Americas, Japan and Turkey. Low penetration of farm equipment in India is likely to boost sales of M&M’s harvesters and rice transplanters, which are developed using technological support from its global subsidiaries.

Outlook

Driven by these strategies, cost-saving measures (Kuber), total productive maintenance (TPM), Poka-Yoke and virtual reality as well as cost synergies across subsidiaries, the company has guided for improvement in margins and maximisation of ROCE.For all recommendations report, click here

The market next week could see movements based on global cues. Investors are awaiting the outcome of G7 Summit, along with the outcome of meetings by the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank (ECB) as well as Bank of Japan.

US President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for a historic summit in Singapore on Tuesday. The key discussion will be the possible dismantling of North Korea's nuclear programme.

Investors are also closely watching developments in the ongoing Global Seven Nations' summit, which started in Canada on Friday, for more signs on the trade tension and discussion over tariffs.

On the global data front, China will release its May data for industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investment on Thursday. On the same day, the US will declare numbers for inflation, retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment.

On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve ends a two-day meeting with a decision on interest rates and a statement on the economy. The central bank is widely expected to raise its target for short term interest rate for the second time this year. The Federal Reserve left its target range for the federal funds rate steady at 1.5-1.75% during its May 2018 meeting, in line with market expectations.

On June 14, the ECB Governing Council meeting will be followed by interest rate announcement. On June 15, Bank of Japan holds monetary policy meeting.

While there are lot of cues to be watched out globally, investors back home will be closely watching macroeconomic data, progress of monsoon, investment by FIIs and DIIs, the movement of rupee against the dollar and crude oil price movement that will dictate trend on the exchanges in the next week.

On the macro front, the government will announce industrial production numbers for April 2018 on Tuesday. The government will announce inflation data of WPI for May 2018 on Thursday.

Here are a few stocks to bet on:

NELCO | Rating: Buy

Nelco has one major business line, which is VSAT service. Nelco is one of the major VSAT service providers in India and is amongst the top three players in the country.

Nelco focuses on providing highly reliable data connectivity solutions across remote parts of the country for the B2B sector using its VSAT services. The company is leveraging the increasing focus of some of the important industry segments in expanding to the remote locations, e.g. the Banking & Financial Services, Renewable Energy, Mining, offshore Oil & gas exploration etc., where the deployment of VSATs is likely to further increase in the years to come.

The company is also evaluating the various government initiatives which are based around expansion to the remote villages across the country which require reliable VSAT connectivity, and will participate in these selectively.

The VSAT industry is fast expanding globally due to advancement in technology, which has opened up many new growth sectors like mobility services, mainly for aero and maritime communication. The advancement in antenna technology is further revolutionizing this industry.

With smaller foot print flat panel antenna, many new applications are evolving for VSATs like connected cars. While the aero and maritime communication services are fast growing sectors for the VSAT industry globally, these services are not yet offered in India due to regulatory restrictions.

The company has made its applications to the government for the necessary regulatory clearances for offering these services in the country and plans to launch these services once the necessary clearances are obtained.

The VSAT industry in India will more than double in two to three years’ time once the licence for offering maritime and aero communication services are given. Looking at this macro change, we are recommending a BUY.

Avenue Supermarts

Radhakrishna Damani, founder of Avenue Supermarts, the parent of D-mart, had to offload some of his stake to achieve minimum public shareholding requirement.

Under SEBI norms, a listed company needs to maintain a minimum public shareholding of 25 percent. The promoter group will have to sell over 7.2 percent stake to bring public holding to that level. D-Mart has reported 73% rise in net profit on YoY basis led by better operating efficiencies.

While revenue increased by 22.5% to Rs 3,810 crore and EBITDA comes at Rs 294 crore with margin expansion of 100 bps on a YoY basis. We remain bullish on Avenue Supermarts for long term. Any dip should consider an opportunity to accumulate this stock.

Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M’s 4QFY18 volumes grew 25.4% YoY. The volume growth was led by tractor volume growth of 40.6% YoY due to positive rural sentiments. UV volume grew by 17.8% YoY. 3W volume grew for the second consecutive quarter by 42.8% YoY. Net realizations grew by 2.1% QoQ partially led by price hikes of ~0.5-1% in auto segment.

The company has not taken any price increase in farm segments in 4QFY18. Net revenues grew 25.6% YoY which is broadly in line. Gross margin comes at 33.8% as raw material cost shrunk by 190bps YoY. EBITDA margin expanded 390bp YoY 15.1% further benefiting from operating leverage and EBITDA break even in CV business.

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) has posted robust growth in net revenues and operating margins in Q4 FY18 on the back of strong industry tailwinds. Sturdy leadership in the farm equipment segment (FES), revival in rural growth, slew of new launches and reasonable valuations make it a stock worth accumulating by long-term investors.

Earnings snapshot

In terms of Q4 performance, India’s largest small commercial vehicle (SCV), second largest commercial vehicle (CV) and third largest passenger vehicle (PV) manufacturer reported a 25.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in revenue at Rs 13,189 crore. Its highest ever revenue was on the back of a 25.3 percent volume growth. The latter was driven by a 40.6 percent growth in tractors and 19.7 percent rise in automotive volumes due to healthy demand for power brands. Average realisation was flat for the quarter under review.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin expanded 390 basis points YoY and touched 15.1 percent on the back of a favourable product mix, leading to a fall in raw material cost as a percentage of net sales. Automotive and farm equipment segments earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins expanded 350 bps and 170 bps YoY, respectively. Net profit was up a whopping 60.2 percent YoY on strong operating performance.

We draw comfort from the following:

Strong outlook for FES

M&M, the market leader in tractors, has been gaining market share (currently 42.9 percent) for the last 3-4 years on new launches. Rural penetration has improved 14 percent YoY and stood at 43 percent at the end of FY18.

On expectations of a normal monsoon and improved rural sentiments, the management pegs volume growth for the industry as a whole at 8-10 percent in FY19 and feels 8-9 percent yearly growth is sustainable in the long-term.

Being the leader, the company is in a sweet spot to take advantage of industry growth. The management believes it would be able to better industry growth on the back of its large exposure to rural and semi-urban areas and launch of new platforms.

Positive impact of GST on automotive segment

With all regulatory headwinds behind it, the management believes rollout of the Goods & Service Tax (GST) will continue to augur well for volumes in the long-term. It sees the PV industry registering record growth of over 10 percent in FY19, with utility vehicle (UV) segment growth of more than 15 percent.

In terms of CV segment outlook, it expects robust demand continuing over the next one-to-two years, given the government’s thrust on infrastructure and mining. M&M has been the numero uno player in the SCV segment with a 47 percent market share. This is on the back of a wide range of product offerings and hopes to capture demand going forward.

Portfolio revamp is on

M&M has a successful UV product portfolio. Response to its refresher Pulse XUV500 has been very strong. The company said it plans to launch three products in the mid-compact UV and premium MPV segments to fill the gaps in its portfolio. Two of which are expected to be launched before Diwali.

Focus on electric vehicles

The company sold 4,026 EVs in FY18 compared to 1,021 units YoY. The management has been aggressively focusing on EVs and plans to expand its manufacturing capacity to 70,000 units by FY20. It is targeting fleet operators for expanding its reach.

Undemanding valuation

The stock’s underperformance has rendered valuation extremely undemanding. Based on sum-of-the-parts valuation (SoTP) and excluding value of subsidiaries, the core automobile business trades at close to 14 times FY20e earnings. The stock is trading at a steep discount to peers, which typically trade at 17-20 times FY20e earnings. We believe there is headroom to grow on the back of a rural recovery and product innovation. Long-term value investors should accumulate M&M for the long-term.

Global brokerage firms such as CLSA, Credit Suisse and Jefferies have maintain their rating on Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) but raised their target price after the auto major announced its Q4 FY18 result. The most aggressive target of Rs 1,075 per share was pegged by CLSA. This translates in a 23 percent gain from Tuesday’s closing price of Rs 868.80 per share.

The domestic vehicle manufacturer reported a 50 percent year-on-year rise in Q4 net profit to Rs 1,155 crore after the market closed on Tuesday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the Mahindra Group flagship company to report a standalone net profit of Rs 1,037 crore for the quarter under review.

Revenue rose 26 percent on year to Rs 13,189 crore. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose over 70 percent over the same period to Rs 1,995 crore.

Global brokerage firms are of the view that valuations still remain attractive at current levels and new product launches, along with a normal monsoon, should boost volumes.

We have collated views from various brokerages on M&M:

CLSA: Buy| Target raised to Rs 1,075 from Rs 960 earlier

CLSA maintains a buy rating on M&M post Q4 results but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 1,075 from Rs 960 earlier.

M&M delivered a strong Q4 led by better-than-expected margins. The rural outlook improved on expectations of a normal monsoon and expectations of a big MSP hike.

New MPV launch in FY19 is likely to boost SUV segment volume. CLSA expects strong 18 percent EPS CAGR over next two years, and valuations still remain attractive.

Credit Suisse: Outperform| Raise target price to Rs 1,030 from Rs 970

Credit Suisse maintains an outperform rating on M&M post Q4 results but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 1,030 from Rs 970 earlier.

The Q4 auto profitability continues to improve, and the EBITDA beat was largely led by operating leverage, product-mix and cost-control. Credit Suisse sees strong FY19 outlook across segments, and the stock trades at an attractive valuation.

Jefferies: Buy| Target raised to Rs 975 from Rs 860 earlier

Jefferies maintains a buy rating on M&M post Q4 results and raised its 12-month target price to Rs 975 from Rs 860 earlier.

M&M delivered a strong 4Q performance as expected, and it remains Jefferies preferred the rural pick. The FY19 growth outlook remains positive across tractors, CVs & PVs. The risk-reward equation remains favourable.

Mahindra today rolled out a new variant of its premium sports utility vehicle XUV 500 in a bit to wrest back the market that once it had dominated as the market pie gets fragmented with the entry of more players like Maruti, Jeep's Compass, Hyundai's Creta and Tata Hexa.

The company has invested Rs 150 crore in developing the third generation of XUV 500--first launched in 2011, which comes with enhanced features like a smart watch connectivity and connected apps and eco-sense technology among others, Mahindra & Mahindra automotive sector president Rajan Wadhera said at the launch here.

The company has sold 2.32 lakh XUV 500s since the launch in 2011, sales and marketing chief Veejay Nakra said, adding the first variant was launched in 2015.

The introduction of the face-lift version is also its bid reclaim its position as the largest UV maker in the country, something it had lost to Maruti Suzuki a couple of years ago. In FY18, with over 27.5 per cent market share the nation's largest passenger car maker led the UV segment by a wide margin over Mahindra.

The new refreshed XUV comes with five diesel variants and a petrol model. While the diesel model is priced at Rs 12.32 lakh, the petrol variant comes at Rs 15.43 lakh.

Launched in 2011, Mahindra had brought out the first facelift of its mid-sized SUV in 2015.

""We have been working on this product for tow-three years. We have taken off a lot of cost to retain the value. As a result we have launched this product at a very competitive price,"" Wadhera said.

Since its launch in 2011, the XUV500 has been a trendsetter in the premium SUV segment with its great value proposition. The vehicle created the premium SUV segment in the Rs 12-18 lakh price range in the country and continues to be the front runner in the segment, he claimed.

""Today, with the launch of the new XUV500, we have strengthened its value proposition further by creating new benchmarks,"" he added.

Evading a direct response to the market share the company was looking at with the launch of new product, Wadhera said, ""it is the function of how many products are coming in the segment. We are obviously looking for a better market share and aim to grow higher than the industry average.""

He, however, acknowledged that the entry of the Compass and the Hexa had changed the market share, adding, earlier our markets share was very high with the Scorpio and the XUV and we were a dominating player.""

Nakra said the company plans to set up 500 more new touchpoints as it aims to roll out three more new product in this fiscal.

Utility vehicle volumes grew 20.97 per cent to 921,780 units last fiscal as against 761,998 units in FY17. In FY18, UV sales accounted for 28 per cent of total PV sales, up from 25 per cent in the previous fiscal, according to Siam data.

Mahindra's PV sales during FY18 stood at 248,859 units, a growth of 5.4 per cent over the previous year, as per the Siam data.

Against this, Maruti Suzuki topped the UV segment with a 27.53 per cent market share in FY18 selling 253,759 units riding on the success of its models like Vitara Brezza, Ertiga and the S-Cross.

Its volumes rose 29.6 per cent at 253,759 units in FY18, from 195,741 units in the previous year, Maruti said.

While Vitara Brezza volume rose 36.7 per cent in 2017 -18, S-Cross saw sales jump 44.4 per cent and 4.1 per cent for the Ertiga, the company said."

Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest car maker, secured a market share of 50 percent in the passenger vehicles segment as its utility vehicles performed better than their peers in the market, The Economic Times reported.

The automobiles major sold 1.65 million units in FY18, an increase of 14 percent from its sales in FY17, thereby crossing the 1.5 million mark for the first time since it started operations over three decades ago.

The company's market share increased by 5 percentage points in the passenger cars segment, reaching a new peak of 57 percent. Its share in the vans segment is a staggering 81 percent.

According to Chairman RC Bhargava, who has been at the company since 1981, Maruti Suzuki's decision to invest in diesel technology at a time when the fuel was cheaper than than petrol, as well as in new models and a beefed-up sales network, are the factors responsible for its success today.

""The 39 percent market share in FY13 was not normal at the time when the gap between petrol and diesel prices widened to around Rs 32 per litre,"" Bhargava told the financial daily.

Maruti Suzuki did not have enough diesel cars in its portfolio when the market was moving from petrol cars to diesel ones, the chairman said, adding that the automaker then augmented its capacity to manufacture diesel-powered vehicles.

""The market has normalised. Of course, we have added a lot of new models and have strengthened the distribution network. Nexa has taken off well; Suzuki investing in Gujarat has freed up resources. These decisions were initially met with hesitation, but we understand the market well and it has paid off,” Bhargava was quoted as saying.

The company bested longstanding market leader Mahindra & Mahindra in the utility vehicles (UV) segment for the first time in FY18, with a lead of 25,000 units in terms of sales, and a 27 percent market share.

Having been India’s leader in passenger cars and vans for some time now, the company believes that its networking with customers, and listening to their issues and solving them is the key to its growing success and market penetration.

""The company has launched models like Baleno, Ignis, S-cross and Vitara Brezza in the past few years in new segments, and also introduced new technologies and platforms, and expanded the sales network. The outcome of these was reflected in the sales performance, with volume growing 29.6 percent in utility vehicles and 28 percent in compact cars, which he said were the best ever for the company,"" Senior Executive Director for Marketing and Sales, RS Kalsi, told ET.

Baleno and Brezza are continually driving volumes higher and Maruti Suzuki also has the launch of the new Ertiga lined up for this year. One of the company’s strengths, along with its strong distribution network, is its brand loyalty, analysts at Elara Capital told the paper."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and Mahindra

M&M's Q3FY18 adjusted profit at Rs9.3bn, up ~15% YoY, was slightly ahead of our estimates. While revenue as well as operating performance was broadly on expected lines with revenue at ~Rs116bn, up 4.6% YoY v/s our estimate of Rs118bn and operating margin at 12.9% v/s PLe of 12.8%, the marginal PAT beat was mainly on account of lower than expected finance cost and effective tax rate. Absolute EBITDA stood at Rs14.9bn, up 18% YoY, with EBITDA margins at 12.8% up 150bps YoY (lower 130bps QoQ), on back of a favourable product mix (higher share of tractors), reduced losses in the MTBD (Truck and Bus division) and operating leverage. Resultantly, EBIT margins for the FES and Auto division came in at 20.5% (up 290bps YoY) and 6.2% (up 170bps YoY) respectively. M&M's volumes continue to be driven by strong demand in tractors and a cyclical recovery in the LCV segment. On the back of a second consecutive year of good monsoon, healthy farm produce and MSPs looking up, M&M's tractor division is expected to continue delivering good performance. Shortage of skilled labour has led to the need of increased mechanization, which is, in turn, leading to a structural shift towards higher HP tractors, accelerating growth and improving profitability. The UV business continues to be a drag with M&M losing ~14% market share over the last three years. However, given the extremely low base, upcoming model launches (MPV/Mahindra branded Tivoli) and refreshes (KUV1oo/TUV3oo) should boost volume growth for M&M over FY19E. Increased government focus on rural economy could further accelerate growth for both, Farm and Auto segment.

Outlook

We maintain 'BUY' with a price target of Rs890, based on a core PE of 16x Mar'20E and value of subsidiaries at Rs250.

Tata Motors, which pipped Mahindra to bag majority of electric vehicle (EV) supplies to state- owned EESL, said today that its homegrown rival did not consider it as competitor but made the loudest outcry.

Tata Motors had last year bagged a tender for supplying 10,000 electric vehicles to Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) at Rs 11.2 lakh each, inclusive of the GST and a five- year warranty.

On the other hand, Mahindra's offer was at over Rs 13 lakh but it later on matched the bid by Tata Motors.

Subsequently, in the first phase EESL decided to take deliveries of 350 units from Tata Motors and 150 units from Mahindra, which said price quoted by its rival was ""hard to comprehend"".

""When we became L1 (winner) in the EESL tender (at the) end of September last year with our Tigor EV, there was almost an outcry in the industry, how is it possible that Tata Motors which was on nobody's radar screen for electrification became L1,"" Tata Motors Tata Motors CEO and MD Guenter Butschek said at a media interaction here.

He further said, ""The loudest outcry was coming from our competition, who did not take us as a competitor into consideration.""

Explaining why Tata Motors was able to come up with such a competitive pricing, Butschek said, ""We have a wide range of smart mobility solutions...we have been consistently investing into this technology in India and also in our engineering centre in the UK.""

The company has been participating in all kinds of studies in this context, he added.

Tata Motors has a wide range of capability in smart energy solutions ranging from hybrid solutions for buses to fuel cells and full electric in busses and passenger vehicles.

Butschek also said Tata Motors has started deliveries of its Tigor EV as part of the EESL order and expects to complete it in the coming weeks."

Outlook

We expect M&M to record an EPS CAGR of ~24% over FY18‐20E. Auto segment has been a drag on profitability. However, new launches in the UV space and reduced losses in the heavy truck segment would boost auto EBIT margins. For the farm segment, a shift towards mechanization and higher HP tractors will further improve profitability. We rollover to Sep’19E from Mar’19 and upgrade the stock from ‘Accumulate’ to ‘BUY’.

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) is looking at various cost reduction measures, including lowering driving range of its electric car e-Verito, in order to be price competitive to supply electric cars to EESL.

M&M coupled with Tata Motors are the only two companies selected by state-owned Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) to supply 500 electric cars in the first phase. The orders for supply of nearly 9,500 electric cars in the second phase will be issued after the completion of deliveries of the 500 EVs in the first phase.

M&M has stated that it would not supply more than 150 electric cars in the first phase as it would incur losses if it goes beyond that. ""One area that we have potentially identified is that the range we have designed our vehicles for is more than what is required in the tender,"" M&M Managing Director Pawan Goenka told PTI. Therefore, matching the range prescribed in the EESL tender would help the company do some savings, he added.

Under real-world conditions, the e-Verito can cover 140 km with a single charge. At present, the cost of M&M's electric vehicle is over Rs 2 lakh more than that of Tata Motors.

""Currently, we are looking at how do we bring down the range. Second, we would look at other areas (features) which are beyond the tender. We will have to be at the tender level,"" Goenka stressed. He, however, ruled out cutting down the length of the vehicle.

""It doesn't happen overnight and by doing so, we will be taking away the comfort of the customer. So, it is not going to happen,"" Goenka noted. He added that the company is now focusing on supplying cars for the first phase of the tender.

Last week, Goenka had said it would be difficult for M&M to participate in the second phase of the tender, saying it would lose money with the present cost structure. Tata Motors will provide electric cars for Rs 11.2 lakh, which will be inclusive of GST and a comprehensive 5-year warranty."

The rise in input costs for auto major Mahindra & Mahindra could likely result in an increase in the prices of vehicles it manufactures, thus impacting the buyer.

Given the robust growth and increase in input prices, there could be a surge in prices for the cars to that extent going forward, according to Mahindra & Mahindra's Group Chief Financial Officer V S Parthasarathy.

“There is a co-relation between input material costs and price. If you look at input costs, they seem to be firming up and globally this has been going up…A pass on that will be required. If the input prices go up, the output prices will also go up. We have to see by how much and what numbers,” Parthasarathy told Moneycontrol.

The Mumbai-based tractor market leader Mahindra & Mahindra witnessed a 50 percent growth in its tractor business, while heavy commercial vehicles grew by 140 percent. Parathasarathy says that the auto major has already increased its capital expenditure (capex) plans by 20 percent this year to Rs 12,000 crore (from Rs 10,000 crore in the last two years-cycle) to invest in product developments.

Group Chief Financial Officer V S Parthasarathy

He said, “Despite capacity not growing, if we are increasing capex by 20 percent, if we see volumes growing, the capacity can further increase and there would be even more upside to it…If things go well, we will be happy to invest more.”

Although the growth in the country has been sluggish for the June quarter at a 3-year low of 5.7 percent post demonetisation and implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST), Parathasarathy is optimistic about the country’s long-term economic growth.

“With GST coming, agreed there has been certain bit of slowness but we can’t take that quarter as a measure because this I would say is preparing for a better tomorrow and that’s why we should look with hope and not worry too much about what has happened. But in September we have seen growth coming, also with GST collections, it will show a better quarter,” he said.

However, the Mahindra executive feels that an interest rate cut of at least 50 basis points (bps) or 0.50 percentage points would be a good enabler to push growth.

“For the industry, if the topline (revenues) is growth by 2 percent and there is inflation as well, it is almost flat growth. We need more growth on the demand side and we have seen first green shoots of growth in September, for our company at least. Broadly, in big projects where old debt is stuck, something needs to be done by unlocking blocked money, capitalisation, etc…Hence, certainly, there is room to cut rates…From an industry perspective there is room for 50 bps cut,” he said, adding that despite the rate hike cycle in the western world, India’s interest rates still has enough headroom to cut rates given the growth potential and stable inflation.

Last week, the Reserve Bank of India announced the monetary policy committee’s (MPC) decision to to keep key policy rate unchanged at 6 percent.

According to Parathasarathy, while a part of the industries like us (auto) are investing, real estate, steel and banking need to get out of the logjam before they start investing. “I think investment is a function of how the demand is functioning in goods and services. This is the right season with rural market coming into play and urban market being steady, and with MPC and government playing its part will see the right push. “Inspite of all the negatives, we have seen 6 percent growth. There is still pent up demand in tractors so rural, agriculture, auto and finance should do well for us,” he added.

With the government mulling a stimulus package of nearly Rs 50,000 crore to revive the muted economic growth in the current financial year, Parathasarathy said that the government can look at any capital formation like investing in major projects. “It’s the most positive stimulus. Second, speeding up asset formation on the projects, in terms of roads, etc...to push those projects. Third: increase in projects in the rural areas.”

In the last week’s monetary policy, RBI Governor Urjit Patel said, “higher fiscal deficit per se can lead to an increase in inflation expectations and actual inflation"".

For Mahindra, September has given a good festival boost in growth and despite slowdown post demonetisation and GST, “overall all things around MSP (minimum support price), there is a steady flow of cash and overall it is a positive; the four-wheeler (particularly tractor) growth which was subdued (past two years) has seen growth…So the cues I see are positive and there should be something that can lead to a start,” Parathasarathy concludes."

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) today announced foray into construction equipment business by launching its first motor grader.

The Mumbai-based company today rolled out its first motor grader -- Mahindra RoadMaster G75 -- under the business vertical.

""We are targeting to sell around 200 units over the next one year. We already have orders for 50 motor graders as of now,"" M&M President Automotive Sector Rajan Wadhera told PTI.

The company's motor grader is priced at Rs 34.99 lakh and around one-third of the cost of big ones being sold by other companies, he added.

The company would introduce other products after establishing the product in the market, Wadhera said.

The RoadMaster G75, being rolled out of the company's Chakan plant, has been designed and developed after an in- depth understanding of the needs of the road contractor fraternity, he added.

""Our aim is to liberate them from deployment of various sub-optimal methods with limited mechanisation and thereby, improve their productivity,"" Wadhera said.

M&M Truck and Bus Division and Construction Equipment Division CEO Vinod Sahay said the motor grader is most suitable for constructing small to medium roads as well as widening of state and national highways.

""It is also apt for applications such as embankment or earthwork for laying of railway tracks and levelling of large plots for industrial construction,"" he added."

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Ford Motor Company today inked a pact to explore a strategic alliance covering areas like product development, electric vehicles and distribution in India and abroad.

Under the agreement, teams from both companies will collaborate and work together for up to 3 years to leverage benefits of Ford's global reach and expertise and Mahindra's scale in India, the two companies said in a statement. ""Any further strategic cooperation between the two companies will be decided at the end of that period,"" they added.

The companies said their alliance would look at areas of potential cooperation including, ""mobility programmes, connected vehicle projects, electrification and product development"".

Besides, it will explore sourcing and commercial efficiencies, distribution within India, improving Ford's reach within India, global emerging markets, improving Mahindra's reach outside of India, the statement added.

Mahindra & Mahindra Managing Director Pawan Goenka said: ""Today's announcement builds on the foundation laid through our past partnership with Ford and will open opportunities for both of us.""

The two companies had a 50:50 joint venture -- Mahindra Ford India Ltd -- in the mid-90s when Ford re-entered India. Goenka said accelerated rise of new technologies, sustainability policies and new models of urban shared mobility have triggered changes in the automotive industry globally.

""Given these changes we see the need to anticipate new market trends, explore alternatives and look for ways to collaborate even as we compete and build powerful synergies that will allow rapid exploitation of the exciting new opportunities,"" he said. Ford Executive Vice-President and President of Global Markets, Jim Farley said the company is committed to India and the alliance could help it deliver the best vehicles and services to customers while profitably growing in the world’s fifth largest vehicle market.

""Our two companies have a long history of cooperation and mutual respect. The memorandum of understanding we have signed today with Mahindra will allow us to work together to take advantage of the changes coming in the auto industry,"" he added.

The enormous growth potential in the utility market and the growing importance of mobility and affordable battery electric vehicles are all aligned with Ford's strategic priorities, Farley said."

For the Mumbai-based auto major, the sales push includes launch of an all-new multi purpose vehicle (MPV) this fiscal, besides upgrading various models.

""We have lost the market share primarily because the universe of UV is expanding very rapidly and also because there are many more competitors than there were 3-4 years ago in the UV segment,"" M&M Managing Director Pawan Goenka said in a conference call.

The company is making conscious efforts to get some of that market share back.

""We have said it very clearly that to get to that old kind of market share is out of question and if we can get to low-30s consistently, that will be a good market share to target and we are working on that through new launches that we have planned,"" Goenka said.

The company has already lost the top slot in the segment to Maruti Suzuki India. M&M's market share stood at 26.07 percent in April-July this fiscal, down from 29.83 percent in the year-ago period.

Maruti Suzuki India has zoomed ahead with 29.93 percent, powered by compact SUV Vitara Brezza.

The automaker is also making certain changes in its current portfolio in terms of product as well as positioning.

The chassis-based products like Scorpio, Bolero range and TUV are doing ""pretty well"", Goenka said.

""These three products together are giving us about 14,000 to 15,000 volume, which is a strong part of our portfolio,"" he added. ""It is in the crossover segment where we need to get a little bit more volume and that is what we are going to do right now.""

Elaborating on new product launches, Goenka said the company is in the process of rolling out a multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) that would compete with the likes of Toyota Innova and Tata Motors Hexa.

""This product has been developed entirely at our Detroit technical centre and right now, we are in the phase of manufacturing set up and try outs,"" Goenka said.

The company also has plans to launch a non-hybrid version of its popular SUV Scorpio and S201 that is based on SsangYong Tivoli platform.

""That launch (S201) will be in the next fiscal and in between, we have several minor and major refreshes,"" Goenka said.

Asked if the company is looking to introduce G4 Rexton in India, Goenka said: ""We are still looking at whether it is affordable for India because it is a very expensive product and if the price is not at a level where there is some kind of volume of getting 300-400 a month, it does not make economic sense to bring that here.""

The automaker is going to decide on that in the next two months, he added."

Diversified Indian conglomerate Mahindra and Mahindra is ""very bullish"" will ""double"" its bets in the US, Executive Chairman Anand Mahindra said, underscoring that the company is a ""big believer"" in America and in its talent.

""We believe in America. I am sure you all wonder how the rest of the world is looking at America in this world of President Donald Trump,"" Mahindra told a group of reporters here yesterday.

He said there can be arguments about immigration and whether immigration will hurt talent in America.

""But that is something that will have an effect may be 5-10 years down the road. But for the moment, the cycle seems to be very much in favour of a very robust US economy,"" he said, adding that it is not for him to say whether that has happened as a result of former US President Barack Obama's policies finally having incubated or whether it is a result of Trump's focus of 'Make in America'.

""We do know that we are very very big believers in America and in its talent. We are going to double our bets in America,"" he said.

Mahindra and Mahindra Managing Director Pawan Goenka said the team of Mahindra Automotive North America is working on an off-road utility vehicle that is expected to be launched in the US within this year.

A manufacturing facility for those vehicles is likely to come up in Michigan, he said.

""The team is doing complete vehicle development for Mahindra. So it is a situation of reversal where an Indian company is going to the US and setting up a technical centre here to draw upon the US expertise of engineers to do global product development,"" Goenka said.

Responding to a question by PTI on concerns over the rise of a protectionist attitude in the US given President Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' focus, Mahindra said ""I think a lot of it is rhetoric. The world is far too inter- connected for people to untangle that web that already exists.

""A lot of the tangled webs that constitute global trade are going to surface. I think the rhetoric is going to be softened,"" he said.

Mahindra added that he does not blame Trump for his focus on increasing investments in the country.

""If his statements are going to make people think a little harder about investing in America, so be it. This will contribute to the growth of the US economy,"" he said.

""We are very bullish, we are going to double our bets here. We are thrilled about that because we had already decided to invest in assembly, manufacturing. We are cheering that statement on. It is not that we are jumping on the bandwagon. We were the bandwagon,"" he said.

On plans of the company to manufacture cars for the US market, Goenka said as of now the company is not thinking of making cars for the US market.

Mahindra owns a 72 per cent stake in Korean automotive company SsangYong Motor and it is currently in the process of doing market research to find out whether SsangYong vehicles' could make sense in the US.

""In India, we've suffered from a poverty of aspirations, not just a poverty of income,"" Mahindra said.

""I am very delighted that this current (Indian) government does not lack the courage to make statements like this,"" he said.

Tech Mahindra will also double its local hiring in the country. IT major Tech Mahindra plans to hire around 2,200 people in the US this year, same as last year.

He said the group has so far invested USD one billion across sectors in the US and in the next five years the diversified Indian group will double that investment, adding a billion dollars to its various businesses.

Mahindra and Mahindra Managing Director Pawan Goenka also announced that the Mahindra Group plans to invest USD one billion across sectors in the US in the next five years, doubling its overall investment in the country so far.

""Our future plans in the US continue to be very aggressive. Over the next five years we hope to double our investment we have in the US,"" Goenka said.

Goenka also touched upon the H1-B visa issue.

Tech Mahindra has been in the news in the US quite a bit lately over the H1-B visa issue. It is perhaps a little misunderstood on what the Indian IT companies mean for the US, Goenka said.

""Lots of people see it as taking away US jobs. The Indian IT companies and Tech Mahindra are creating US jobs and not taking away US jobs,"" Goenka told a group of reporters here yesterday.

Tech Mahindra President - Strategic Verticals Lakshmanan Chidambaram said the Indian IT company has had a presence in the US for over a decade, with two billion dollars in revenues and 6,000 employees in the US.

""We are also hiring from 25 US institutions with whom we have a very strong relationship. This hiring has been happening over a period of fours years now. We bring in fresh graduates, train them and bring them in the workforce in the US,"" Chidambaram said.

Responding to a question by PTI on whether the company is realigning its policies amid the Donald Trump administration's tough stance on immigration and H1B work visas, Chidambaram said certain bills for reforming the H1B visa progarmme are being introduced in the US, but ""they will have to go through the whole process"".

A bill that was introduced never came out the way it was introduced.

He added that at the moment, Tech Mahindra's focus has been on investing in its development centers.

""More than the H-1B, the focus is what is happening with the whole digital revolution that is taking place,"" Chidambaram said, adding that the IT platforms are forcing the companies to think in a different way.

""Certain situations bring the best out in people,"" he said.

Goenka added that the projected investment amount could go up significantly if the company is able to win a contract it is bidding for with the US Postal Service for replacing its fleet of postal vehicles.

""One big ticket item if that happens this number will go up. We are bidding for a contract with the US Postal Service for replacing its fleet of postal vehicles,"" he said.

On the employment front, Goenka said the company currently employs 3,000 local people in the US and it is estimated that this number will grow up to 7,000 in the next five years.

The IT major currently employs 2300 people in the US and this number will go up to 5000 in the next five years.

The company said the local hiring in the US will be separate from the H1B visa holder that it employs for technology work in the country.

Goenka underscored that the hiring plans are in place not due to the recent policy announcements in the Donald Trump administration but that the company had planned to increase local hiring even before the new US administration's plans.

""We hope to double the local employment that we have in the US, increase our presence through more development centers and manufacturing locations and build our brand,"" he said.

The Mahindra brand is reasonably well known in the US ""but we need to do a lot more work and focus a lot on building the brand over the years,"" he said adding that the US is a very important market for the company, the second largest after India.

The company has a revenue of about USD 2.6 billion out of US which is more than 10 per cent of Mahindra's global revenue."

The S&P BSE Sensex is trading in unchartered waters and allocating fresh money at these levels could be one of the toughest decision to make for any investor as chances of profit booking cannot be ruled out.

The Nifty too is chasing 10,000 level which is likely to act as stiff resistance for the index and market should cool off post the event, suggest experts. However, a major decline is not something which analysts’ see unless it gets triggered by a global event.

“The market psychology is defensive at this time since almost all participants are positioned for a correction. This is giving some cushion on the downside. In all likelihood any correction will be on account of global developments and not local ones,” Anshul Saigal - Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager – Kotak Mutual Fund told Moneycontrol.

Considering the fact that Indian market is dancing on tunes of global liquidity and any knee-jerk reaction in global markets could also pull Indian markets lower. Indian market is already trading in overbought zone and at a trailing P/E of 25x which was last seen in 2010, and 2008.

“10,000 on Nifty is a huge technical resistance and Sensex/Nifty P/E’s are also hitting 25x so from both angles investors should be cautious especially since when both these factors reach resistances then there is usually a good 10-15 percent decline over the next few months,” Rishi Kolhi, CEO, ProAlpha Capital told Moneycontrol.

“Also, there are global inter-market divergences with some indices like India’s hitting new highs while many are below their previous highs and this has also been a good signal for a halt to the uptrend in the past,” he said.

Kolhi advises investors to use the up move to book profits and re-enter in the decline where one can start investing at 9,500.

The ideal strategy for investors would be to pick up quality names on declines because the bullish sentiment is likely to continue in the market. With the no initial hiccups in the GST implementation, indirect tax collection is expected to improve going ahead.

The direct tax collection figures were also good in the first quarter of the current fiscal with personal advance tax increasing by 40 percent, suggest experts.

“While this is a long term story, the short term story is the possibility of rate cut fuelled by the weak IIP data and lower inflation,” Shrikant Akolkar, Sr. Equity Research Analyst, Angel Broking Pvt Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“The market is trading between 18-19x of its one-year consensus forward earnings and investors should stick to the quality companies. While we are optimistic, profit booking may give fresh buying opportunities in the quality companies,” he said.

Here is a list of 15 quality stocks which analysts’ feel are a good buy even at current levels:

Analyst: Jay Purohit, Technical & Derivatives Analyst at Centrum Broking Limited

Fortis Healthcare: BUY

The pharma space is going through a tough time from last few months. In line with the peers, the ‘Fortis Healthcare’ too seen a decent correction in the recent past.

Investors can take a long entry in the counter on every decline towards the mentioned zone for an upside target of Rs200 – Rs215 in the upcoming quarter. The stop loss should be kept below Rs135 on a closing basis.

Apollo Hospitals: BUY

The stock is moving in a sideways direction from last few months and currently rebounding from the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) of a Bullish Harmonic Pattern named as ‘Bullish Gartley’ on the daily chart.

The ‘RSI’ oscillator has turned northwards from its support of 30-35 on the daily chart, indicating strength in the counter. Thus, we advise traders to go long in the stock on every decline towards Rs1230 for a target of Rs1325 – Rs. 1340. The stop loss for the trade should be kept at below Rs1305.

Reliance Industries: BUY

After a decent rally from 1013 to 1467, the stock has started moving in a sideway direction. However, in last week, we witnessed a breakout from the consolidation phase of the last couple of months.

The breakout supported by healthy volumes and thus suggesting a sustainable move in the upcoming session. The ‘RSI’ oscillator, which measures the stock momentum, has given a trend line breakout on the daily chart, indicating strength in the counter.

Considering the above mentioned technical evidence; we are expecting a continuation in ongoing momentum in near term too. Hence, we advise traders to buy this stock for a target of Rs 1630 - 1650. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs 1460.

Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.

Ujjivan Financial: BUY

The stock has made a ‘Double Bottom’ pattern and has started rebounding from last few sessions. After many weeks, we witnessed a ‘Higher Highs Higher Lows’ formation on the daily chart of the stock, indicating bullishness in the counter.

Going forward, we are expecting the stock to reach towards Rs390 – Rs400 in near term. Thus, traders are advised to initiate long positions with a stop loss of Rs317.

Marico: BUY

The stock is moving in a strong uptrend by maintaining ‘Higher Highs Higher Lows’ on the weekly and monthly chart. From last three months, the stock was moving in a sideways direction and Thursday, we witnessed a breakout from the consolidation phase.

Since moving averages and momentum oscillator is also indicating strength in the counter, we are upbeat on the stock for a target of Rs. 360 – 365 in near term. The protective stop loss should be kept below Rs 314.

Analyst: Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan

HDFC Bank: BUY

HDFC Bank has a pre-eminent presence in the retail banking segment (50% of loan book) and has been able to maintain a strong & consistent loan book growth, gradually gaining market share.

Also, as lending and transactions through formal routes increase, HDFC Bank would benefit since it is a leading private sector bank and it is likely that it will gain market share in this segment.

The bank is likely to maintain a healthy RoE of 18-20% and ROA of 1.8% on a sustainable basis. Therefore, we expect it to sustain the valuation premium that it enjoys vis-à-vis other private banks.

IndusInd Bank: BUY

IndusInd Bank has maintained its asset quality despite sluggish economic growth and a higher proportion of retail finance in its loan book. A likely revival in the domestic economy will further fuel growth in the bank’s consumer finance division while strong capital ratios will support future growth plans.

Though demonetisation has raised questions regarding delinquencies in certain lending segments, the management expects the asset quality to remain under control. The stock should continue to trade at a premium valuation, underpinned by strong loan growth, quality management, high RoAs and healthy asset quality.

ITC: BUY

ITC’s cigarette business, which contributes about 80 percent to the company’s EBITDA, continues to be the cash cow. With reduced concerns about the core cigarette business and comforting valuation (discount vis-à-vis some of the large cap FMCG players), ITC is one of the best picks in the FMCG space.

Maruti Suzuki India: BUY

Maruti Suzuki India (Maruti) is India’s largest passenger vehicle (PV) manufacturer with a strong 47 percent market share. The ramp up of Gujarat capacity would enable Maruti to clock volume growth of 12.6 percent in FY2018 which is higher than the estimated industry growth of about 8-10%.

Maruti continues to remain our top bet in the automotive space given the sustained trend of outpacing the passenger vehicle industry growth and advise investors to accumulate the stock in event of price volatility.

Reliance Industries: BUY

Sharekhan expects Reliance Industries’ (RIL) GRM to remain strong at $10.9/11.7 per bbl in FY2018/FY2019 given the robust global oil demand growth outlook for 2017 at 1.3-1.4mbpd (International Energy Agency estimate).

The domestic brokerage firm expects EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 21%/9% over FY2017-FY2019E, driven by the commissioning of the core downstream projects in FY2018. Any positive surprise in terms of better-than-expected financials of the Telecom business would be an important re-rating trigger for RIL going forward.

Analyst: Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com

Mahindra and Mahindra: BUY

With robust products in the pipeline and strong marketing plan for recently launched products in SUV segment, the company is expected to regain the market share by 10 per cent.

The company also plans out to focus on exiting power brands to enhance market breath. It is expected to register volume growth in Tractor and UV segment on the backdrop demand increase from the rural segment.

ADF Foods: BUY

With stronger fundamental in terms of business model and niche product offering the company has consistently delivered a growth in terms of revenue generation.

With less debt on its balance sheet & increasing cash flow from operating activities, it is expected to expand its geographical presence across the rural & urban segment. The company is also a benefiter of the GST regime, monsoon and reviving rural expenditure.

Transport Corporation of India (TCI): BUY

TCI is one of the organized players in logistics segment and one of the sole benefactor by the changing tax regime. This changing regime will enhance the warehousing and supply chain management business with all sectors expected to route through a single pipeline.

Havells India: BUY

The recent acquisition of Lloyd business by Havell’s is expected to increase the consumer base in long term. Being a one of the pivot player in the electrical segment the company will expect to witness the volume growth coupled with increased revenue generation.

The company is also expected to witness revenue flow from its premium product offered to industry customer.

EID Parry: BUY

The Sugar industry witnessed a turnover in a recent development on import free duty which is expected to ease the price for domestic companies. EID Parry Ltd will be key recipient with low-cost materials.

With value addition and cost control, EID Parry reported a strong growth on bottom-line in last quarter. EID Parry is expected to continue with this trend improving macro fundamental.

Brokerage Firm: Edelweiss Financial Services

MCX: BUY

Q1FY18 marked another quarter of soft volumes post demonetisation for Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) – ADTV fell 24% YoY/3% QoQ to Rs188bn. However, better yield realisation of Rs2.24/lakh and controlled opex supported earnings.

Positively, post-GST implementation, some uptick in volumes was witnessed. With volumes being a key driver of earnings growth, there is a similar cut in earnings as well. Given structural volume growth visibility (though now deferred beyond FY18), operating leverage benefits and MCX’s entrenched leadership, we assign 36x earnings multiple giving us a fair value of Rs 1,310 for the stock.

Automobile major Mahindra and Mahindra is readying two new models by the next fiscal-end as it looks to consolidate its position in the Indian passenger vehicle segment.

The company, which sells utility vehicles ranging from compact KUV100 to XUV500, also has plans to introduce a new electric vehicle in the next two years.

""We have two products coming in the next two years. One is the U321 (code name) multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) which has been developed on the new global platform developed here in Detroit. It will come out this financial year,"" M&M Managing Director Pawan Goenka told PTI.

The vehicle would compete with the likes of Toyota Innova and Tata Motors Hexa in the Indian market.

""Second one is S 201 which is based on SsangYong platform Tivoli. It will come out in the next financial year,"" Goenka said.

Both vehicles will be launched in India first and the company would consider introducing them in other geographies as well.

The company sells nearly 18,000 passenger vehicles per month in the domestic market and its market share has been consistent at around 8 per cent for last few years.

""Last couple of years, we have not grown market share, but similarly, we haven't lost either,"" Goenka said.

On the road ahead, he added: ""Clearly, every company will wish to grow its market share and for that, we need to ensure our current products continue to do well and bring in volumes.""

Asked about the company's plans on electric vehicles, Goenka said the company would like to establish four models it currently has in its portfolio before bringing in a new product.

""Though we are investing in future projects, right now, the focus would be on these four products and generate some volume for us. A new product probably would come in about two years,"" he added.

About the company’s plans to launch passenger vehicle operations in the US, where it faced various issues in the past, Goenka said: ""We had some lawsuits which all have been settled now. Right now, we don't have any plans for on-road utility vehicles and our only plan here is off-road vehicle. We will wait and watch and then decide about the future.""

In 2010, its exclusive American distributor had filed a lawsuit against the company ""for taking too long"" to launch a pick-up truck in the country.

On the two-wheeler business, Goenka said the company is now moving from the commuter segment to high-end premium bikes.

""We are changing strategy as far as the two-wheeler business is concerned. We are moving away from the commuter segment to high-end premium bikes and we are working on bikes based on BSA and Yezdi brands,"" the MD added.

He, however, declined to give a timeline for launch of new products.

About the government's decision to keep hybrid vehicles in the same slab as luxury cars, Goenka said: ""We have given a representation to the government that even if they don't want to give full sops they can look at partial sops. Otherwise, hybrid as a segment will die down.""

Under the new tax regime, hybrid vehicles are on the same slab as luxury cars at 28 per cent GST plus 15 per cent cess. At 43 per cent, total tax incidence on these vehicles is higher from the previous effective tax rate of 30.3 per cent."

The automobile major’s March quarter performance was an operational miss, but outlook is robust, said Citi in its report. It increased the tractor volume estimates by 22 percent over FY18-19. It also said that the weakness in utility vehicles was now baked into expectations.

Brokerage: Nomura | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 1,586

The brokerage house observed that there was a strong growth outlook for tractors. New UV launches can act as a catalyst, it said. M&M and MVML Q4 EBITDA was 10% ahead of estimates, driven by better realisations.

Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 1,600

The brokerage observed that Q4 beat was driven by one offs EBIT in line with the estimates. It observed that the company guided for double-digit tractor growth in FY18. New launches in FY18 revolve around new KUV/gasoline launch of XUV & a new MPV."

Major auto players will come out with their April sales numbers, which are likely to be mixed as passenger vehicle (PV) makers may report better sales, while commercial vehicles (CV) manufacturers could report decline in their April sales, according to a report by an analyst firm.

In the two-wheelers segment, TVS Motor may report 5.9 percent year on year increase in volumes, while Hero MotoCorp's sales are expected to decline 5.3 percent YoY, a report from Motilal Oswal indicates.

According to the report, PVs will continue its growth momentum and outperform the auto industry growth in April 2017. Meanwhile, 2-wheelers and commercial vehicles’ volume are expected to decline in April-17 YoY and MoM.

""Our channel check suggests, retail off-take in two-wheelers segment is expected to remain weak followed by pre-buy of BS-3 vehicles in the previous month,"" it added.

Key highlights from the report

Maruti Suzuki is expected to outperform the PV industry, while Ashok Leyland and TVS Motor could outperform CV and two-wheelers industry respectively.

PVs are likely to continue its growth trajectory and outperform auto industry growth led by Maruti Suzuki, which it expects to report 8 percent growth in its overall volumes in April. The growth in Maruti volumes will be led by strong demand of Baleno and Brezza. “Our channel check indicates these models still enjoys healthy waiting period of 5-7weeks,” it said in the report.

Tata Motors’ PV segment is expected to maintain strong growth momentum driven by Tiago and complimented by newly launched Tigor.

In the two-wheeler segment, it expects TVS to record a 5.9 percent YoY increase in volumes led by strong growth in its scooters and mopeds portfolio.

Hero MotoCorp's volumes are expected to decline 5.3 percent YoY, it expects Bajaj Auto’s volumes to decline sharply by 17.8 percent led by decline in domestic 2W and 3W volumes.

Retail off-take in two-wheeler volumes are expected to remain weak, followed by pre-buy of BS-3 vehicles in the previous month.

“We expect Royal Enfield volumes to grow at 25 percent YoY growth in April-17 at 60,000 units. Situation in two-wheelers are expected to improve on a MoM basis as demonetization impact wanes off, however as indicted by management of 2W OEM, situation is improving gradually,” the report added.

CV players are expected to record decline in sales due to pre buying effect on account of change in emission norms. “We expect Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland to report double digit decline in their CV volumes by 21 percent and 23 percent respectively,” it said.

We prefer four-wheelers over two-wheelers and CVs due to stronger volume growth and stable competitive environment. While we expect two-wheeler volumes to benefit from rural recovery in near term, competitive intensity remains high in segment witnessing changing customer preferences.

For CVs, we expect volumes to remain muted atleast for next 2-3 quarters due to pre-buying, GST implementation and cost inflation with relatively weak freight availability.

“Our top-picks are Tata Motors, Maruti Suzuki and Amara Raja. We also like Mahindra and Mahindra as best bet on rural market recovery,” the brokerage house said in a report."

Reliance Industries

Citi maintained its buy call on the stock with an increase in its bull case target to Rs 1,923 due to higher Jio valuation and lower peak net debt. It believes that the company’s outperformance could sustain as the earnings are an at an inflection point. Among key risks to the stock are weakening in refining fundamentals and global petrochemical spreads, the research firm added.

Analysts at the firm termed the company’s March quarter performance as strong, with the standalone EBITDA being 3 percent ahead of estimates. Meanwhile, the profit after tax (PAT) was largely in line, it said. Gross refining margins of USD 11.5 per barrel

were above its estimates, it said.

On the company’s capex plans, it sees standalone capex being lesser than USD 2.5 billion in FY18. Jio’s capex in the first quarter of the fiscal will be similar to March quarter before declining sharply, it said.

Nomura maintained its buy call on the stock as well, but with an unchanged target price of Rs 1,540. The brokerage house observed that the net profit was 1-2 percent ahead of its estimates, driven by lower tax rate. It too feels that the recent outperformance of the company could sustain.

However, the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and profit before tax (PBT) were below its estimates on the back of higher depreciation and lower other income. These numbers too were partly offset by lower finance costs, it added.

Going forward, it sees earnings growing ahead once Jio, petchem and refining expansion projects start to deliver. It expects consolidated EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 19 percent/15 percent, respectively over FY16-20.

Meanwhile, it observed that high capex on Jio continued during the quarter and expects similar capex in Q1 of this fiscal. The near term focus will be on addition in customers of Jio. Having said that, it feels that the large capex cycle is coming to an end.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch has downgraded the stock to neutral, but increased the target price to Rs 1,450 from Rs 1,375. The global brokerage firm observed that the firm’s March quarter net profit was 9 percent above estimates, while refining beat was led by GRM.

Analysts at the firm now have the focus on Jio’s success and the capex cycle. They believe that a further rerating on the stock is contingent on a successful Jio P&L as well as falling capex. It further added that while capex could decline, there is limited visibility on a successful Jio P&L.

The stock could find support from growth in Jio’s monthly subscribers, while weak margin, project startup hiccups and high capex were the key risks, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, has an overweight rating on the stock as it saw upside risks from improving energy margins as well as project executions. A steady project pipeline commissioning from FY18 should reduce the risk of further capex, it added.

JPMorgan is neutral on Reliance with an increased target price of Rs 1,310 from Rs 1,240. While the lower capex in its core business was positive, Jio was the key unknown element, it said. Further extension of discounts by Jio would be negative, it added.

Rolling forward its valuation to FY19, Deutsche Bank raised its target by 10 percent to Rs 1,600. Lower downstream margins, policy vagaries were the key downside risks for stock, it said.

(Disclosure: Reliance Industries owns Network 18 that publishes Moneycontrol.com.)

Indiabulls Housing Finance

CLSA retained its buy call on Indiabulls Housing Finance with an increase in target price to Rs 1,170 from Rs 950. The brokerage firm also raised its earnings estimates by 3 percent and saw 23 percent profit CAGR over FY17-20. It observed that the earnings growth was led by topline growth and operating efficiencies. CLSA also saw growth to be led by housing loans, especially from the affordable segment in the next three years.

Mahindra and Mahindra

Credit Suisse upgraded Mahindra and Mahindra to outperform from neutral and increased the target price to Rs 1,500 from Rs 1,390, implying 20 percent potential upside. While tractor volumes were up 14 percent in March despite demonetisation, there was a potential for tractor business to surprise positively, it added.

The weakness in utility vehicle market was already factored in, it observed. The stock was currently trading at a 40 percent discount to Maruti Suzuki, which it expects to narrow.

UltraTech Cement

CLSA raised the target price of the stock to Rs 4,575 from Rs 4,000. The company’s March quarter performance was in line with its estimates, it stated. A pan-India presence, growth focus and cost optimization were the key focusses, CLSA said. UltraTech was the only preferred stock in the sector, it added.

Deutsche Bank reiterated its buy call on the stock with an increase in target price to Rs 4,750 from Rs 4,560. It highlighted the company’s gain in market share during a challenging environment in the cement space. Moreover, it expects continuing reduction in costs and working capital for the company.

Despite the not-so-encouraging initial forecasts about the monsoons, tractor major Mahindra & Mahindra today sounded confident of maintaining last year's sales momentum and grow in double-digits.

While the industry closed fiscal 2017 with a 18 percent growth, we clipped at 23 percent. We hope to maintain this momentum and grow in double digits in sales volume, M&M president for farm equipment sector Rajesh Jejurikar said without quantifying the sales target.

He further said though the initial forecasts are a bit negative with a projected deficiency of 5 percent, tractor sales are not solely dependent on monsoons of the next season but more on the past year's rainfall pattern.

It also depends on the rain distribution, the reservoir levels, which determine the farmer sentiment more.

In fiscal 2017, M&M, which increased its market share by 180 bps to 42.7 per cent, sold 2.48 lakh units, a growth of 23 percent, while exports rose to 15,000, he said, adding against this the industry grew 18 percent to 5.82 lakh units.

For the industry which bled in the previous two years, this was the second best in volumes after fiscal 2014 when it had notched up a volume of 6.35 lakh, Jejurikar said.

On the impact of the GST on the farm equipment sector, he said its difficult to forecast anything as the rates are not announced yet.

Currently, farm equipments attract zero excise duty while the VAT varies from 5 to 6 per cent.

Jejurikar, who was speaking to reporters after launching a small tractor Jivo, said the company has invested Rs 95 crore to develop the new machine targeted mainly at affluent horticulture farmers.

The new four-wheel drive tractor Jivo is priced between Rs 3.90 lakh and Rs 4.05 lakh (ex-Maharashtra).

The tractor is available in the four-wheel drive version with engine power of 24 horse power. With its launch, Mahindra enters the growing segment of horticulture and row crop farming.

""The Jivo has been designed keeping in mind the latent needs of this specialised farming segment and is an ideal choice for the farmers owing to its narrow and compact build and high power,"" he said, adding the tractor will be available in Maharashtra and Gujarat from April 25 to begin with and later on in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.

The Jivo can be used across multiple applications including crop care, land preparation and inter culture activities, he said, adding they will be launching a 20 HP two-wheel drive Jivo around September."

Mahindra & Mahindra

CLSA has retained an underperform rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,280. The research firm sees launch of two SUVs over the next two years. Meanwhile, it also senses that the electric vehicle development business will become a bigger part of the company’s strategy.

The research firm highlighted the company’s aim to increase market share in non-tractors and overseas business. It foresaw the farm equipment division business attaining USD 5 billion revenue mark.

Credit Suisse has maintained a neutral call on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 1,390. It believes that the auto sector faces challenges with changes on emissions, powertrains and connectivity. Going forward, the company has planned a dual strategy on electric vehicles with focus on mass models on commercial side.

The research firm sees an early mover advantage for the firm in the electric vehicles segment. In the farm segment, Credit Suisse foresees market share in farm equipments and highlighted that it was looking to provide end to end solutions in agriculture business.

Meanwhile, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has highlighted the company’s target to increase share of implements to 20 percent by FY19. It also stated that the automobile major was targeting 50 percent revenue from outside India against 37 percent in FY17.

Credit Suisse has highlighted that delinquencies for microfinance institutions (MFIs) will move up further to over 10 percent against 7.5 percent in December and has no signs of recovery. While disbursements by MFIs have picked up, it is yet to reflect in collections, it said. Based on this, it sees a heightened risk for banks with large MFI exposure."

Russia is open to localising component production of its modern Sukhoi super jet even as it is talking to Mahindra and Mahindra for partnership for the MC 21 civil aviation aircraft, Russian Trade and Industry Minister Denis Manturov said here.

""We have a very good example of a modern aircraft, the Sukhoi super jet project. We are open to both exporting it to the Indian market as well as localising some of the components production. We are working on another civil aviation project, the MC 21 aircraft which is scheduled to have its first flight soon and we are having talks with Indian aerospace company Mahindra and Mahindra,"" Manturov said at the International Engineering Sourcing Show (IESS) organised by EEPC India here.

He let out that a Mahindra subsidiary is manufacturing interiors for the Sukhoi super jet.

""I think they can also be a part of the MC 21 project, both for manufacturing some components and producing the interiors for the aircraft,"" the minister said.

Manturov, who held bilateral talks with India's Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on the sidelines of IESS, which opened yesterday, said having been associated with India's defence sector, Russia is keen to get involved with the country's civil aviation as well.

""We are currently having another project for 2114 (commercial) aircraft for regional airlines. We think that it is really compatible with the Indian market. It has a lot of demand for the Indian market and we are open to both Mahindra and Mahindra and other aerospace companies to manufacture components for this aircraft in India,"" he said.

As for India's defence requirements, Russia will supply 60 multi-purpose Kazan helicopters in the first phase while joint facilities will be set up in India for the manufacturing of 140 helicopters. The agreement for the project will soon be finalised and announced, a Russian official said.

As a partner country, Russia has a predominant position at IESS, being organised by EEPC India with active support of the Commerce and Industry Ministry, besides the Department of Heavy Industry. Over 400 global companies are participating in the sixth edition of the event."

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is focusing on developing 3-4 electric vehicles in the Rs 8-10 lakh price bracket as it aims to bring in models that are affordable for masses and help in reducing air pollution.

The home-grown auto major, however, has not ruled out an electric SUV and may bring out a model in the next 3-4 years based on group firm Pininfarina's design inputs.

""We are focusing heavily on vehicles that can go into the Olas and Ubers and become the prime mover for the masses in the commercial segment, in the personal mobility segment, in the aggregators, that is our prime focus,"" M&M Managing Director Pawan Goenka told PTI.

The company's focus currently is to bring 3-4 affordable electric vehicles which will be more of ""Rs 8-10 lakh kinds"", he added.

Elaborating for developing easy-to-own electric vehicles, Goenka said pollution could be reduced only if more and more people are able to buy electric vehicles.

""Globally, people are working on electric vehicles that are high performance, high powered and sell at a significant premium over petrol and diesel vehicles. The view that we have taken is the reason we want to do electric vehicles is to help clean the environment which means that it has to be mass affordable, it cannot be a niche segment,"" he explained.

India does not have the same kind of subsidies many other countries offer on buying electric vehicles, Goenka pointed out.

""India has about 2,000 dollars (subsidy). There are countries which have 10,000 dollars, therefore we cannot have a very high-end vehicle because nobody will buy it and it does not even serve the purpose. What if 200 people bought it? It won't help much in curbing pollution,"" he added.

Goenka, however, did not rule out an electric SUV from the Mahindra stable in future.

""It is not that we won't do SUVs because that is what creates an image. So for image, we have to do things like that. Dream is to work on a Pinifarina SUV which is moving on an electric powertrain, but we are probably 3-4 years from that, we are still starting on that,"" he added.

Goenka termed the government support as critical for expanding the segment in the country.

""The problem right now with electric vehicles is that the government has always talked about the segment, but the seriousness that is there now was not there before,"" he said.

""Now the Prime Minister himself is pushing the ministries to come up with sort of details to make electric vehicles viable,"" he stressed.

He said subsidies for electric vehicles is sufficient and the real issue is lack of charging infrastructure.

""Somewhere, the cycle needs to start and I am hoping that the next financial year will be the year of electric vehicles and a lot of demand will come in,"" Goenka said."

Decentralisation and empowerment of people are needed for developing world-class cities in India, said Mahindra & Mahindra's chairman Anand Mahindra.

""Decentralisation and empowerment of people in India is much needed,"" said Mahindra here adding ""real essence of design in a city is its people and community."" For developing a good city, interaction of the people and their dynamics is more important, he said.

""It is about interaction and dynamics of people that is what excites me about planning,"" said Mahindra at the third edition of its thought leadership platform Confluence.

NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said that the process of better urbanisation has just began in India.

""The process of better urbanisation has just began and it could be done with better planning and legislation on the back of good technology and public transportation."" On the rapid urbanisation in India, he said the country would do more urbanisation in the next five years than it did in 5000 years.

He further said: ""Urbanisation is one of the areas where India can leap frog and place a good example among many countries and we can create better livable creativity of the future through the process of urbanisation."" Highlighting the use of mobile technology in developing new cities, Kant added that India has a great opportunity as it is the only country in the world which has billion biometric and mobile.

""""You can manage your cities on mobile on real time basis,"" he added.

Demonetisation shaved off as much as Rs 8,000 crore in revenues of auto and tractor industry during November and December but the recovery has been quicker than anticipated and normalcy will be restored by month-end, said Pawan Goenka of Mahindra & Mahindra.

In an interaction with PTI, he said if all of the drop in automobile and tractor sales in November and December were to be attributed to junking of 500 and 1,000 rupee notes and not any other seasonal factor, the loss to the industry may be of the order of Rs 8,000 crore or 10 per cent of total revenue.

""The effect was deeper than we had thought and the recovery is also quicker than we thought and I believe that by end of March we would be through,"" he said.

Goenka, who is the Managing Director of M&M, said the long-term beneficial impact of demonetisation on the economy would be very much if the government was able to do what they had set out to do with the note ban.

Sales momentum in the automobile industry, which was on a high after a good festive season in September and October last year, came to a halt when the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was announced in early November, according to Goenka.

""We have worked out... some kind of formula that tractor and auto industry lost Rs 8,000 crore revenue in November and December. The way we have done that (is) what was the growth rate up to October and if that growth rate had continued in November and December what would have happened versus what has (actually) happened (in terms of sales). That's a fairly straight forward calculation. Its Rs 8,000 crore for the industry and its about 10 per cent loss of revenue,"" he said.

In November, vehicle sales across categories registered a decline of 5.48 per cent at 15,63,665 units, from 16,54,407 in November 2015. It was the steepest decline in 43 months when total sales had declined by 7.75 per cent in March 2013.

In December, monthly automobile sales growth in India had slipped to a 16-year-low in December, with total vehicle sales declining by 18.66 per cent at 12,21,929 units compared to 15,02,314 in December 2015.

According to SIAM, most of the major segments, including scooters, motorcycles and cars, witnessed record decline in December sales due to cash crunch following demonetisation.

Stating that the auto and tractor sectors were ""in very high momentum"" in September and October, Goenka said: ""The kind of sales we had in October, I have not seen in a long time."" In September 2016, total sales of vehicles across categories grew by 20.16 per cent to 22,60,992 units as against 18,81,643 units in the year-ago month. There was a growth of 8.14 per cent to 22,01,571 units in October 2016 from 20,35,905 units in October 2015.

Goenka further said: ""It (demonetisation) just stopped the momentum and then it takes time to build up because there is no rational reason why people do not buy now."" He said at present there are ""too many uncertainties"" such as the upcoming GST and that ""probably is having bigger psychological impact"" on consumers.

While the overall impact on demonetisation ""was very deep in November and December"", he said it has started improving in January and ""I think by now we are almost done and I believe that by end of March we will be through""."

Driven by the faster growth of app-based cab aggregators in recent years, domestic taxi market is on course to account for 15-17 percent of total passenger vehicles volume by fiscal 2020, says an Icra report.

Though domestic taxi market is still in a nascent stage, there is huge scope for growth given the low car penetration and poor public transport. Considering strong demand and increasing penetration of the aggragators in smaller town, the taxi market is poised for robust double- digit growth over next two-three years, says the report.

""In fiscal 2016, fleet sales, including to cab aggregators, accounted just about 9 percent of the passenger vehicles volume and this is expected to almost double to 15-17 percent by fiscal 2020,"" says the Icra report.

It can be noted that the Ubers and Olas of the market have not only disrupted the auto-rickshaw and traditional taxi markets but also forced automakers to revise their growth and marketing strategies by tying up with them.

Domestic auto majors like Maruti, Tata Motors, Mahindra and even the German luxe carmaker BMW among others have formally tied up with Ola and Uber.

While M&M plans to provide 40,000 vehicles to Ola, Tata Motors's arrangement with Uber eyes vehicle purchase and ownership solution. Under this arrangement, cars like Indica/Indigo will be provided by Tata Motors, financed by Tata Capital or Tata Motors finance and insured by Tata AIG.

The trend is very active globally as well. The top three carmakers -- Volkswagen has tied with Gett, while Toyota has an arrangement with Uber, and General Motors with Lyft to leverage changing customer preference.

A typical fleet operator owns around 500 cabs, while aggregators like Ola and Uber have over lakhs of cars with them. Consequently, this segment now enjoys a significant clout, with some OEMs setting up dedicated team to address aggregator market.

While first time-buyers account for only 40-45 percent of the volume now, 30-35 percent of the volume comes from the replacement market and the rest are other segments."

February sales of major auto firms slowed, largely due to demonetisation woes. Passenger vehicles overall posted steady numbers, but two-wheeler sales lagged as the rural market was still recovering from cash crunch issues. Analysts cite demand issues for the sector in general, but feel it may improve as cash situation gets better. Growth in passenger vehicles were largely driven by Maruti Suzuki , which reported 11 percent year-on-year growth, research firm Nomura said in a note. “Our channel checks indicate that footfalls were up 15-20 percent and industry retails growth was also in mid-teens,” the report added. In medium and heavy commercial vehicles, demand was soft despite pre-buying during the month, Nomura said. It maintained that industry demand would be weak in FY18F. Simultaneously, two-wheeler industry volumes’ fall was lower than its estimates. This was largely due to only 5 percent drop in Hero Motocorp as compared to its forecast of 13 percent decline. It estimates overall volumes to be down 1 percent YoY. The research firm remains positive on Maruti Suzuki (MSIL), with a buy call, due to its healthy model launch pipeline, strong waiting period and premiumisation portfolio. “While Gujarat plant started production from February, dispatches should begin from March 2017 onwards. Given strong demand, MSIL should keep operating at full capacity in FY18F,” the report stated. Motilal Oswal highlighted below estimate sales and slow exports. It believed that Mini segment declined on poor rural demand, while compact segment grew due to Baleno and Ignis sales. The brokerage maintains its buy call on the stock, which trades at 18.9X/15.6X FY18E/19E. Its consolidated EPS is at Rs 313/379.Nomura is negative on Ashok Leyland , with a reduce call, as it foresees rising headwinds to MHCV industry growth in FY18/19F due to price hikes on BS-IV emission norms, efficiency gains due to GST and rising competition from railways. Motilal Oswal too concurs with the opinion on pre-buying being higher, but demand and volumes being lower. It estimates FY17 growth at 4 percent, implying 21 percent growth. The brokerage maintains its buy call on the stock, which trades at 13.9 X/10.9X FY18E/FY19E EPS and at 8.35/6.5X EV/EBITDA. The brokerage house highlighted the positive surprise in tractors and UVs segments in case of Mahindra and Mahindra . “Tractor sales were above estimates at 15,007 units (v/s est 13,750 units), registering a 11 percent YoY growth (-6 percent MoM) on the back of good rabi sowing coupled with increase in MSPs,” the report added. It maintains its buy call on the stock currently.Meanwhile, for Tata Motors , the MHCV segment saw a growth due to pre-buying. Users are expecting a price increase due to BS-IV implementation from next month. It highlighted that the stock traded at 12.7x/6.4x FY18E/19E consolidated EPS respectively and maintained a buy call.On two wheelers, Motilal Oswal cites demonetisation impact as the reason behind lower volumes on Hero Motocorp . But, with improvement in the currency situation and consumer sentiment, volumes are set to rise, it says. It maintains a neutral stance on the stock, which trades at 15.8/15.5X FY18/19 EPS. In case of TVS Motor , it believes growth in mopeds and scooters partially offset fall in motorcycles and three-wheelers. “Strong moped growth is seen on the back of lower base of FY16 along with improved sentiments on the back of normal monsoon,” the brokerage house’s report added. It has maintained its buy rating on the stock."

Domestic automobile company Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is assessing the feasibility of a plan to drive in an electric sports car, much like Elon Musk-led Tesla, to satiate the needs of Indian auto enthusiasts.

For this, the company is looking to couple Mahindra Electric’s expertise in electric cars with the design capabilities of Italian Pininfarina which it acquired a year ago, The Economic Times reported Thursday.

Terming the project as M&M’s “dream”, Managing Director Pawan Goenka said while many companies are launching electrics, only one or two have been successful in cracking the volumes game. The viability study will take 3-6 months, he told the paper.

M&M is already at an advanced stage of developing an electric SUV, based on its KUV platform. The electric SUV is expected to hit the market after 2018-2019.Separately, M&M is planning to set up a hub outside India to shore up 50 percent automotive revenues from international operations.

Rajesh Jejurikar, President and Chief executive, farm equipment & two-wheelers division, on Wednesday said M&M is already the No. 1 tractor maker in the world in terms of volume and is present in 30 markets, including the US, Finland, Algeria, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, China, Japan and Australia."

As part of its strategy to net 50 per cent of automotive revenues from overseas by fiscal 2019, homegrown auto player Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is planning to set up a second base for itself outside the country.

The focus on setting up a base on a foreign shore emanates from the fact that M&M is aspiring to be a global player backed by Rs 4,200-crore investments it has done in several countries in farm machinery and auto sector since 2008 when it made the biggest buyout by snapping up over 60 per cent in Punjab Tractors followed by SsangYong.

""There is a need for us to have a second base outside the home market and we are working on it. But we can't give more details now,"" said a senior management member during an informal interaction with the media here today.

Rajesh Jejurikar, president & chief executive, farm equipment & two-wheelers division, said, M&M is already the no 1 tractor maker in the world in terms of volume and is present in 30 markets, including the US, Finland, Algeria, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, China, Japan and Australia.

Talking about the global aspiration, Jejurikar explained that in 2015, the geographical mix of M&M's farm machinery products stood at around 30 per cent which rose to 37 per cent in the current financial year. It is projected to jump to 50 per cent by fiscal 2019.

Group managing director Pawan Goenka said both M&M and its South Korean SsangYong are working together to design engines on a common platform.

""Both the companies will develop their own product around it which is expected to be launched by the middle of 2018,"" Goenka said, adding currently the company makes around 30 per cent of its revenue from overseas.

M&M had acquired 70 per cent stake in the then struggling SsangYong Motors in 2011 for around USD 450 million and since then has turned it around.

Synergy between the two is expected to save about USD 70 million over the next five years for the group, he added.

On reports about American car major Ford is planning to collaborate with M&M in certain aspects of business, Goenka said, ""I will not either confirm or deny the report. It is very common for any auto company to be in talks with four to five others for a possible collaboration or partnership. But chances of such talks fructifying remain one out of five."""

Navistar, the US-based truck major who had a joint venture with tractor and utility vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra , has bagged a contract to supply armoured trucks to the Pakistan Army.The US Department of Defense issued a USD 35 million contract for supplying 40 MaxxPro Dash DXM mine-resistant, armoured trucks to Pakistan.While Indian companies are ramping up their presence across several armies around the world they are, however, barred from supplying defence products to Pakistan. Exports of passenger vehicles to the neighbouring country, too, are banned.Mahindra and Navistar had a long running partnership for two joint ventures in India that made trucks, buses and high capacity diesel engines. The JV developed trucks from scratch for the Indian market under the brand Mahindra Navistar.In 2012, however, the US company expressed its willingness to exit the joint ventures as it wanted to focus on the US market. In the following year M&M purchased Navistar’s stakes in the two JVs for an undisclosed sum.Break-up of the Mahindra-Navistar JV could be partly attributed to the fact that Navistar wanted to pursue international military contracts including those emerging from Pakistan awarded by the US. Such deals could have progressively created hurdles for M&M’s very own defence ambitions.Pakistan has been using mine-resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicles as part of its claimed counter insurgency operations in the federally administered tribal areas (FATA). Pakistan had sought surplus MRAPs from US stocks in Afghanistan under the Excess Defence Articles (EDA) programme. However, they failed to materialise.Mahindra, meanwhile, is aggressively bidding for Indian defence contracts chasing deals meant to serve all the three units Army, Airforce and Navy. The Mumbai-based company has also bid for the mammoth Rs 60,000 crore contract to build 2,600 units of Future Infantry Combat Vehicles (FICV). Tata Motors is amongst the other bidders for the project."

Mahindra group-owned automotive design firm Pininfarina has inked a pact worth 65 million euros (around Rs 460 crore) with Hong-Kong listed Hybrid Kinetic Group for developing an electric car.

As part of the agreement, the Turin-based company will support Hybrid Kinetic in the turnkey development of an electric car from the styling concept and development till virtual and physical validation for series production.

The collaboration agreement, worth about 65 million euros, will have a total duration of 46 months and Tech Mahindra is expected to play a significant role.

""This agreement confirms the primacy of our company in the world of automotive design, engineering and production of small series at a time of great change in the automotive world. Synergies with a larger group such as Tech Mahindra are strengthening our business opportunities,"" Pininfarina Group CEO Silvio Pietro Angori said in a statement.

In fact, the company is now more competitive because it has access to a wider range of world-class skills at lower costs, he added.

""To our respective existing customer pools we can offer fully comprehensive design and engineering services. Further, we see synergies with Tech Mahindra enabling us to compete with more traditional players in the domain of electric and hybrid platforms, autonomous driving and connected cars,"" Angori said.

The combination of Italian design from Pininfarina and of best competitive engineering from Tech Mahindra will make a major difference in a wide range of industries, he added.

In 2015, Mahindra group had announced to acquire Pininfarina for an overall outgo of over 50 million euros (nearly Rs 370 crore) after months of negotiations.

Italian bike and scooter major Piaggio, which owns the iconic brand Vespa, has decided against giving motorcycles any major push but will instead direct its attention towards scooters.Iconic premium bike brand Moto Guzzi, which was launched by the company late last year, will remain a product with limited reach as there are no immediate plans to expand its footprint in a 'big way’.“Moto Guzzi is an iconic brand. We are not thinking to launch it in a big way in India because it's more to make the consumer understand that Piaggio also has that kind of brand in its portfolio”, said Stefano Pelle, Chief Executive and Managing Director, Piaggio India in an exclusive chat with Moneycontrol.In fact the company has even decided against launching new motorcycles at least in the budget performance segment (250cc-350cc) till next year. Such small capacity bikes were to debut under the superbike brand Aprilia.Instead Piaggio brought a 150cc scooter under the Aprilia brand, something which is unique for the Indian market. When asked if Piaggio will bring out small capacity motorcycles under Aprilia Stefano said that such bikes were planned but the priority are scooters for the time being.“Not very soon, because that is something that was started, and today our priority is scooters and not motorbikes. We feel we need to concentrate on this (scooter) segment first and then later on we might also be doing something on the bikes, but that’s not our priority right now”, added Pelle.The budget performance bike segment has witnessed tremendous traction in recent years. New launches from Bajaj Auto , KTM, Yamaha, Mahindra & Mahindra , Benelli, Hyosung and UM Motorcycles have populated this market. TVS Motors and BMW in addition to launches from existing players will further intensify competition.Piaggio, which also sells cargo and passenger three-wheelers in India, believes that brand Aprilia is not as popularly known as some of its rivals. Therefore, it is important for the company to build a brand connect first before launching competitive products at later stages.The launch of a moto scooter under the Aprilia brand is a step in that direction believe market experts considering the huge demand for scooters in India. Aprilia wants to create a niche for itself in that segment with fast and high performance urban scooters. It recently launched the Aprilia SR 150, a powerful urban scooter, priced at Rs 70,000.“Aprilia is known amongst those who are passionate about bikes. If one goes to talk about Aprilia with a man on the street, he will not know what it is. So in terms of top-of-the-mind Aprilia is very small. So when we launched the Aprilia SR we had to launch the brand as well as launch the product. That was the challenge. On the other hand those who know Aprilia know what kind of bikes we make so those who new the brand this was a very nice surprise. For those who do not know the brand they have to first know what Aprilia stands for”, added Pelle."

India's largest life insurer -- Life Insurance Corporation -- will announce its quarterly numbers Monday. But, in what would be the first time in its six decades of existence, the company’s Chairman will also hold a press conference to discuss the results, reports the Business Standard today.

With nearly 72.61 percent market share of the life insurance industry and an investment corpus bigger than the entire mutual fund industry put together, the insurance giant has taken the initiative to address the media as part of its strategy to make its presence and importance known to India Inc. and the stock market.

LIC holds sizeable stakes of over 10 percent in 49 companies including index heavyweights like L&T (15.7 percent), Bharat Heavy Engineering & ITC (14.3 percent each), Tata Steel (13.6 percent), Hindalco (11.4 percent), and M&M (10.3 percent). Among other investments, it has over 10 percent stake in banking majors Corporation Bank (18.9 percent), Axis Bank (13.9 percent), Punjab National Bank (12.5 percent), and ICICI Bank (10.9 percent).

In March 2016, it had an investment corpus of roughly Rs 22.1 lakh crore, much higher than the industry’s total of Rs 17 lakh crore. Investments of 23 other insurers totalled Rs 18 lkah crore as the end of FY16.

Market experts consider the move to formally announce results as a much-needed step in improving the transparency, particularly considering the size of its investments in the industry behemoths. Despite its huge investments across the industry with a say in most boardroom decisions with the high equity stake, the insurance major would, so far, discreetly post its annual report on its website without much hype."

German commercial vehicle heavyweight Daimler will make new investments while launching 100 products this year to combat competition from Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland, who control 62 percent of the total domestic CV market. In an exclusive chat with Moneycontrol, Eric Nesselhauf, Managing Director and Chief Executive of Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV), said that the company will go ahead with its plans despite uncertainty over demand owing to new emission norms, regulatory changes and proposed rollout of the Goods and Services Tax.

""Beginning April we will have a completely new range of heavy-duty trucks on new platforms for the Indian market,"" Nesselhauf said. ""We will also have 16-tonne and 9-tonne trucks for launch. All in all we will have at least 100 launches this year.”

DICV’s sub 9 and 16 tonne vehicles will debut in the second half of the year. “As a matter of principle, we do not disclose details of product-related investments for competitive reasons,” said Nesselhauf. DICV had invested Rs 500 crore last year. taking its total investments in India to Rs 5,000 crore.

New launches by DICV come at a time when the industry is facing several hurdles. The two most critical are the regulatory changes made by the government, which are the upgradation to Bharat Stage IV emission norms and mandatory fitment of air conditioning units in driver cabins. Demand for commercial vehicles itself has been lacklustre, doubly hit by demonetisation. According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, the apex lobby body of the auto industry, sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV) declined by nearly 11 percent in the last three months to 59,208 units as against 66,300 units sold in the same period last year. For DICV, demand during last year largely remained flat. The Chennai-headquartered company logged sales of 13,081 units, a drop of 6.5 percent compared to 13,997 units sold in 2015. Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland jointly control 83 percent of the MHCV market. New entrants in the last few years such as Mahindra & Mahindra and VE Commercial Vehicles (Volvo-Eicher JV) have made deeper inroads into the CV market. Tata Motors is also believed to gearing up for launching around 100 models and variants this year spread across its portfolio of 1 tonne to 49 tonnes. The company kick-started the year with the launch of a new pick-up truck called Xenon Yodha. Rivals Mahindra & Mahindra said it will invest Rs 700 crore to develop intermediate and light commercial vehicles over the period of next two years. The Mumbai-headquartered company wants to become a full range CV player with an aim to launch 15-16 new products in the ICV and LCV range. DICV has its facility in Oragadam, near Chennai, which houses truck and bus plants. Spread over 400 acres, the facility has a truck-making capacity to produce up to 72,000 units a year depending on the shift model. Buses have a capacity of 1,500 a year, which is expandable to 4,000 units a year."

M&M's (+MVML^) Q3 EBITDA was a 5% beat, driven by resilient margin. Management didn’t provide an FY18 guidance on tractors, but indicated scope for growth given that it’s still early cycle and we are still 10% below previous peak. We build in a 12% tractor growth in FY18 post a 20% growth in FY17.

Outlook

While that is good for M&M from a top-down point of view (tractors and majority of UVs are rural facing), from a bottom-up view we remain worried about its dwindling Auto market share and margin. We lower FY18 estimates by 8%. Maintain HOLD with revised TP of Rs 1,272 vs. Rs 1,340 earlier.

Mahindra & Mahindra today said it will foray into the intermediate commercial vehicles segment by the end of 2017-18 as part of its plans to triple market share in the CV market in next five years.

The company is in the process of investing Rs 700 crore to develop new intermediate commercial vehicles (ICVs) and light commercial vehicles (LCVs).

It is expecting to launch 15-16 models of ICVs and LCVs altogether as it seeks to become a full range CV player by in the next two and half years.

""We will be entering into the ICV segment by the end of FY18. It is a part of our plans to become a full range CV player,"" Mahindra Trucks and Buses Ltd Managing Director and CEO Nalin Mehta told PTI here.

The ICV ranging from 8-16 tonnes vehicles will be supplemented by new products from LCVs, he added.

""Currently an investment of Rs 700 crore is ongoing. This investment is for both ICV and new LCV. We already have prototypes which are being tested,"" Mehta said.

Elaborating on the company's plans, he said:""Our target is to double our market share in the CV space in two years.

Once we become a full range player we are looking a triple it.

""M&M currently has 3.5 per cent share in the heavy commercial vehicles segment while in LCV it has around 9 per cent share. It is not present in the ICV category. Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland are the major players in the segments.

""So, as we go ahead we will be launching a new product every two-three months starting from the end of FY18. We have great expectations from our CV division,"" Mehta said.

When asked by when the truck and bus division is expected to be a profit centre, Mehta didn't share an exact time line but said it could happen in the next five years or even before that.

""Once we become a full range player, our production capacity utilisation will increase, our ability to leverage on suppliers will increase. So we should be able to achieve profitable growth,"" he added.

He said the engines for the ICV are being developed by its engineers at Chennai and will be assembled at the Pune facility.

""These ICV engines can also find their way to our tractors. Since the products are being launched close to 2020 most of them will be BS VI emission norm complaint,"" Mehta added."

Swaraj BaggonkarMoneycontrolA day after Bajaj Auto Managing Director Rajiv Bajaj accused the automotive industry of dragging its feet on upgrading to Bharat Stage IV (BS-IV) norms Eric Nesselhauf, Managing Director of Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV) joined Bajaj in launching a scathing attack on the industry today.Nesselhauf said some companies are deliberately trying to defer the transition to the higher emission standard. DICV, which sells trucks in the 9-49 tonne category under the Bharat-Benz brand, had fully migrated to BS-IV in 2015. DICV is the Indian subsidiary of the German heavyweight Daimler-Benz.“Continuing discussions on BS-IV are reflecting obvious attempts of some players in the Indian commercial vehicle industry to dilute this upcoming transition of emissions standards”, Nesselhauf said.DICV’s peers like Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland and Mahindra & Mahindra, who control more than 80 percent of the domestic commercial vehicle industry, are yet to exhaust their inventory of BS-III vehicles which have higher carbon emissions. Moreover, many companies have said that they will continue to make BS-III vehicles till March 31, 2017.“Recent studies on air quality show how important this project is for the people and the environment. It should not be diluted by commercial interests. There is no acceptable reason for any delay, as everyone in the industry had enough time to get ready for the transition”, added Nesselhauf.On Wednesday, Bajaj said that any amnesty given to automakers allowing them to sell BS-III vehicles after April 1, 2017 will set a bad precedent to the industry and thereby defeating the very purpose of having a cleaner environment.“With Bharat-Benz, we have the best technology in the market based on proven solutions. We have been selling several hundred BS4 vehicles since August 2015. The positive feedback from these early BS4 customers clearly tells us that Bharat-Benz is fully ready for the transition”, added Nesselhauf.The government had mandated that from April 1, 2016 all new models sold in country have to be BS-IV compliant while the remaining models can upgrade by March 31, 2017. This is the first time that the government adopted a two phase strategy for the roll out of a new emission norm.The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has asked that the industry should be given time to exhaust its BS-III stock of vehicles. The apex lobby body of the automobile industry, in its justification, stated a notification from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway (MoRTH) which allows the manufacture of BS-III vehicles till March 31, 2017. It added the demonetisation has led to lower demand and inventory build-up.“The issue is that the industry wants to keep pumping BS-III stock into the market. If there is any granting of amnesty or postponing the date of effective registration, our submission is that one who has done it on time is at a disadvantage and those who have chosen to be complacent or who are perhaps incompetent or perhaps a combination of both are going to keep selling the more polluting stuff for longer at lower prices. Obviously, this is not fair,” Bajaj said."

Home-grown auto major Mahindra and Mahindra is hiking production of its trucks with the introduction of a second shift at its Chakan plant to meet increased orders for the Blazo vehicles.

The company, which today introduced a service support initiative for its commercial vehicles on the Delhi-Mumbai service corridor, will sell trucks only under the Blazo range once the BS IV emission norms kick in from April 1 this year.

""We have been selling on an average around 500 units a month and last month we sold 616 units. Considering the orders for our Blazo trucks, we have added a second shift so that from this month and March we produce more vehicles,"" Nalin Mehta, CEO Mahindra Truck and Bus Division and Managing Director, Mahindra Truck and Bus Ltd told PTI.

He, however, declined to share by how much the production will go up and the number of pending orders.

Mahindra Truck and Bus Division (MTBD) produces the new range of medium and heavy commercial vehicle at the Chakan plant.

When asked about the market conditions specially after demonetisation, Mehta said while the industry has been hurt, being a new entrant Mahindra has been least affected.

""We are a new player and for us it is about penetrating new market. While the industry has declined, we have grown,"" he said, adding that in the ongoing fiscal so far the company has sold around 3,500 heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs) and 8,000 light commercial vehicles (LCV).

As per SIAM data, total medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales in the April-January period this fiscal stood at 2,32,589 units and Mahindra sold 5,668 units.

On the upcoming BS IV emission norms, he said: ""We are prepared. Our Blazo range is fully compliant with the new norms and going forward we will sell only under this range. We have not upgraded the other products."" Mahindra has been selling trucks under Blazo and Truxo brands.

With after sales and service becoming a critical part of the business, Mehta said MTBD has been focussing on giving its customers enhanced experience and setting up the service initiative on the Delhi-Mumbai corridor is yet another step.

""The Delhi-Mumbai stretch accounts for nearly 30 per cent of trucking traffic in the country. Considering the importance of this route, MTBD decided to launch the service corridor to enable customers get prompt access to quality service and spare parts,"" he said.

Under this initiative, the company is giving guarantee to its customer that in case of breakdown on the corridor, its service help will arrive within 2 hours and if not, it will pay a penalty of Rs 500 for every extra hour of delay."

Swaraj BaggonkarMoneycontrolMahindra & Mahindra will launch two new utility vehicles next financial year in addition to upgrades to the existing range, as it looks to protect market share in its core utility vehicle segment.The Mumbai-based company will launch a multi-utility vehicle codenamed U321 before the end of next financial year preceded by a sports utility vehicle codenamed S201 in the second half of the year.M&M's market share in the UV space has nearly halved to 29 percent from 56 per cent in 2012. Maruti Suzuki became the biggest disruptor snatching away a share of 26 percent followed by Hyundai with a share of nearly 13 per cent and Toyota at 12 percent, as per SIAM data.The U321 will be M&M’s answer to Toyota’s runaway success Innova Crysta as well as Maruti Suzuki’s Ertiga. M&M has committed Rs 1,500 crore investment for manufacturing the U321 at its Nashik plant and its engines at the Igatpuri plant.“The U321 is being developed by Mahindra North American Technical Center in Detroit by American engineers,"" said Pawan Goenka, managing director, Mahindra & Mahindra.""It will be produced at the Nashik plant. As a result, the capacity in Nashik will go up from 160,000 to 210,000 vehicles per annum,” he said.“The investment is for product development, tooling, dies and fixtures and will be done over the next three years. It is designed like a multi-purpose vehicle not an SUV which means it is focused on movement of people. The U321 will be marketed outside India too”, he said.The Rs 1,500 crore investment is part of the Rs 10,000 crore investment announced by the company earlier which is to be spent by the end of the upcoming financial year.In the second half of the financial year M&M will introduce a stylish new SUV codenamed S201. This new SUV will be based on the X100 platform which presently houses the SsangYong Tivoli. The S201 will be positioned between the KUV100 and TUV300 and will take on the likes of Ford Ecosport, Maruti Brezza and the yet-to-be-launched Tata Nexon. Interestingly there wont be a huge gap between the S201 and the Nexon launch dates as both would debut in the second half of next year.Further gasoline version of XUV500 is likely to be launched in first quarter of next year and depending on the response, the company would launch gasoline version of Scorpio too. Apart from these, there would be periodic refreshes to the existing vehicle range.“The passenger vehicle (PV) industry remained subdued during the recently concluded quarter but the UV segment continued to report a healthy growth in volumes. As of today UVs account for 25 percent of the total PV volumes which means one in every four vehicles sold is a UV”, added Goenka.As per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) UVs recorded sales rise of 32 per cent to 618,427 units during the period of April-January this year as against the same period last year.In comparison passenger cars reported a growth of just 3 per cent to 1,740,308 units compared to the same period last year. The entire PV segment, which includes vans, reported a growth of 9 per cent during the same period."

Bank of Baroda

With retaining buy call on Bank of Baroda, with increased target price at Rs 225 from Rs 195, CLSA says Q3 earnings missed estimates but stressed loans were below peers and bank is better than most PSU banks w.r.t asset quality & capitalisation. Key disappointment in Q3 was annualised delinquency ratio at 4 percent. Higher-than-expected credit cost is key drag on Q3 results, it says.

Macquarie has maintained underperform rating on the stock, with reduced target at Rs 115 from Rs 116 following cut in FY17 EPS by 36 percent & FY18 by 8 percent.

Morgan Stanley is also underweight on the stock, with reduced target at Rs 125 from Rs 135 as valuation is expensive in the context of weak earnings progression. Share price will fall relative to the industry over the next 30 days, it feels.

JPMorgan says margins in Q3 declined sharply as yields remained under pressure, while assigning underweight call on the stock with a target price at Rs 133.

Kotak has also maintained reduce rating as growth concerns are yet to be addressed. Loan growth would be a disappointment as compared to investors' expectations and return on equity visibility beyond 12-14 percent by FY2019 still poses as a challenge, it feels. The brokerage house has increased target price to Rs 170 from Rs 160.

State Bank of India

CLSA says the bank's performance has been improving but cut earnings estimates as arms still dragged. Asset-quality pressure moderated with delinquency ratio at 3 percent and 35 percent CASA deposit growth due to demonetisation was a key positive.

The brokerage house feels loan growth can improve from 5 percent YoY as bank gained from lending-rate cuts. CLSA has retained buy call on the stock with target price at Rs 330. According to the research firm, slower-than-expected uptick in India’s economy growth is a key downside risk for the bank and credit risk in the corporate segment is another risk to estimates.

Goldman Sachs has retained neutral call on the stock on balanced risk-reward, with increased target at Rs 262 from Rs 253 and increased FY17-19 EPS by 1-7 percent on Q3 trends. Earnings were below expectations on core but asset quality trends are healthy.

While maintaining buy call on the stock, Kotak says it is top pick in the PSU pack with target price of Rs 320.

Coal India

CLSA has sell call on Coal India, with a target price at Rs 285 and cut FY17 EPS by 2 percent but maintained FY18-19 estimates. The brokerage house sees risk of a partial rollback in coking coal price hike while it feels improvement in volume growth may continue and blended realisations should also improve in Q4.

JPMorgan says Q3 profit missed estimates but underlying earnings were not as bad. Earnings will benefit from the recent coking coal price hike, it feels. The brokerage house remained neutral on the stock, with a target price at Rs 330.

Macquarie has reiterated its underperform rating on Coal India, with a target price at Rs 250 and cut FY17-19 EPS estimates by 7-8 percent. ""Results reaffirmed our bearish outlook on its margins & earnings,"" the brokerage house says, adding stagnant FSA (fuel supply agreement) realisation failed to reflect 6 percent price hike. Fundamentals continued to get worse and suggested de-rating, it feels.

Goldman Sachs has maintained buy call on the stock but cut target to Rs 345 from Rs 360 as it has reduced FY17-19 EBITDA by 4-8 percent mainly on lower average selling price and cut FY17-19 EPS by 8-10 percent.

Idea Cellular

CLSA has a sell call on Idea Cellular, with increased target at Rs 100 from Rs 68. Lower EBITDA & higher interest costs drove company into losses. Disappointing core performance led by a decline in revenue and network costs drag margins & interest burden led to loss in Q3. The brokerage house has cut FY17-19 forecast by 5-25 percent. According to the research firm, potential Vodafone merger is positive but may not fructify before FY19.

Goldman Sachs says Idea's reported Q3 revenues were broadly in line with expectations and wireless revenue growth at negative 4 percent YoY was worse than Bharti & Vodafone. The brokerage house has maintained neutral rating on the stock, with an unchanged target price of Rs 63.

CESC

Nomura has buy call on the stock, with target price of Rs 725 as earnings were in-line with forecasts but above consensus.

CLSA has also a buy call on CESC, with a target price at Rs 1,000. Key issue ahead is the scale-up of the distribution business, it says.

Tata Power

CLSA expects an earnings turnaround in Tata Power led initially by its net long coal position and suggests buying the stock on rebound in coal & expanding of renewables business. Currently it has a buy call on the stock, with a target price at Rs 97.

JPMorgan is overweight on the stock, with a target price at Rs 90.

Crompton Greaves

Morgan Stanley says margin disappointment drove EBITDA miss for Crompton Greaves, while assigning equal-weight rating on the stock, with a target at Rs 60.

Kotak revised its target price on the stock to Rs 65, but it is cautious on the stock. Operationally Q3 was good standalone quarter but outlook appears good, it says.

Hindustan Zinc

Kotak says Hindustan Zinc's Q3 performance was in-line but it has downgraded the stock to reduce on expensive valuations, with increased target price at Rs 290 from Rs 265.

Full benefit of higher mined volume did not reflect in refined metal sales and maintaining guidance at higher than FY16 translated into a strong Q4, the brokerage house says, adding deficit in 2017 & falling inventories can push zinc prices beyond estimates.

Tata Communications

Morgan Stanley is overweight on Tata Communications, with a target price at Rs 690. Proceeds from sale of Singapore data centre is expected in Q4, it feels.

GAIL

Goldman Sachs remained neutral on GAIL but raised target price to Rs 420, driven by earnings changes.

Lower gas transmission volumes were offset by higher transmission tariffs, the brokerage house says. It expects petchem utilisation rates to be the key driver of earnings growth.

Mahindra & Mahindra

Goldman Sachs has maintained buy call on Mahindra & Mahindra, with increased target price by 0.3 percent to Rs 1,376. It feels rural demand should recover led by increased cash availability. The brokerage house has changed FY17/FY18/FY19 standalone earnings by -4.7 percent/-1.9 percent/3.5 percent.

Havells

Kotak has a reduce call on Havells, with a target price at Rs 400. It believe company's brand capabilities will enable strong earnings CAGR."

We invest around Rs 2,500 crore every year towards capex plan and investment in Nashik will be part of our investment strategy, Goenka said.

The company had earlier announced Rs 4,500 crore investment in the Chakan facility as part of its expansion programme, he said, adding that the part I of the phase II has completed.

""We are going ahead with part II now. Discussing the company's expansion plans. Maharashtra government's visionary industrial policies and efficient governance practices, has enabled us to undertake the next phase of our expansion plans at Nashik,"" he said.

The company reported 33.29 per cent increase in standalone profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 1,112.27 crore for the third quarter ended December 31 2016, driven by an exceptional income of Rs 363.78 crore on account of sale of investment in group firms."

Signalling a drive towards recovery with the impact of demonetisation waning off, passenger vehicle (PV) sales in India rose by 14 percent in January reviving hopes of the automobile industry to achieve double digit growth this fiscal.

However, with two-wheeler sales still continuing to be in the negative zone, the overall sales across categories registered a decline of 4.71 percent to 16,20,045 units from 17,00,141 units in January 2016.

In December 2016, the overall automobile sales growth had touched a 16-year-low at 12,21,929 units, down 18.66 percent, from 15,02,314 units in December 2015.

Domestic car sales also ticked up to 1,86,523 units as against 1,68,303 in January last year, up 10.83 percent, SIAM said.

""Most of the sectors have shown improvement last month.

Sales growth in passenger vehicles has been encouraging. It seems that the impact of demonetisation is waning off,"" SIAM Director General Vishnu Mathur told reporters here.

Car sales have also witnessed robust growth even in rural areas, he added.

Commenting on two-wheeler segment, Mathur said it will take some more time for the segment to fully recover from the demonetisation blues.

""Motorcycle sales were down 22 percent in December. In January it is down 6 percent. So the sales are increasing but owing to segment's large base it will take some time to fully recover,"" Mathur said."

Amtek Auto is ""very close"" to completing an asset monetisation deal that will significantly reduce the New Delhi-headquartered component manufacturer’s debt, sources have told CNBC-TV18.

The company is likely to raise USD 1 billion via asset monetisation. Neumayer Tekfor, which Amtek acquired in 2013, is set to contribute the largest portion of the asset monetisation plan. The exercise is likely to reduce the company’s debt by Rs 6,000 crore to Rs 7,000 crore.The deal is expected to be completed by March, the sources told CNBC-TV18. The company's stock up was 11 percent after the news broke, with an intra-day high of 15 percent. Desperate to get rid of the huge debt of more than Rs 13,000 crore, Delhi-based Amtek has been trying to sell its German division Tekfor since October 2015 without much success. As many as seven bids were received by Amtek by October last year but the asking price, which is believed to be in the range of USD 800 million-USD 1 billion has disappointed the bidders. Britain's decision to exit from the Europe Union also hit the sale process.

Mahindra & Mahindra’s Spanish partner CIE was believed to be a prospective buyer. However, M&M is not in favour of participating in an ‘auction-like’ sale process.

A Chinese company and a private equity company were also believed to have expressed interest in the sale.

""This is in keeping with the company's customer centric approach. The inspection and subsequent rectification will be carried out free of cost for Bolero Maxi Truck Plus DI customers, who will be individually contacted by the company,"" it added.

The company, however, did not reveal as how many units of the model were impacted.

Last year in September, the company had recalled certain number of its new generation Scorpio and NuvoSport SUVs to rectify faulty fluid hose in engine compartment.

Earlier, it had also recalled an unspecified number of SsangYong Rexton SUV due to a suspected fault with the rear driveshaft."

The Union Budget held no major disappointments or negative surprises, helping the Nifty maintain its uptrend in the week gone by. The Nifty was up over a percent on top of the 3.5 percent rally in previous week and reclaimed its 8700 level. Stable earnings and positive global cues also supported the market. The Nifty Midcap outperformed benchmark indices, up 2.5 percent in the past week.

The rally is expected to continue in the next week, though there might be some consolidation initially, ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s significant monetary policy review on February 8.

Foreign Institutional Investors also remained supportive in the last three consecutive weeks and major support was also seen from domestic institutional investors. Overall, when FIIs sold more than Rs 30,000 crore worth of shares since October 2016, Domestic Institutional Investors made Rs 40,000 crore worth of buying in equities.

In addition, expected large spending on infrastructure, cut in lending rates, the government's prudence on the fiscal deficit front, earnings improvement from next financial year onwards etc will also be supportive factors for the next upmove.

""At present, things look favourable for a further up-move but caution is advisable, considering the upcoming monetary policy review meet,"" said Jayant Manglik of Religare Securities.

Dipen Shah of Kotak Securities said that going ahead, the remaining quarterly results will be important to determine the impact of demonetisation. Expectations of interest rate cuts have increased, after the Finance Minister set the fiscal deficit target at 3.2 percent, he feels.

Sandeep Bhatia of Macquarie Securities Group also expects the Reserve Bank of India to announce a rate cut next week. The prospect of a rate cut should be buoyed by the fact that the rupee had been faring better than other currencies in Asia, he feels.

Manglik believes midcap and smallcap space will continue to attract buying interest. ""Now, we are eyeing 8900 in Nifty and expect banking, auto and NBFC counters to endure their outperformance,"" Manglik says.

On the earnings front, a lot of major companies such as SBI, Bank of Baroda, PNB, Coal India, BHEL, Cipla, M&M, Tata Steel, NTPC, Hero Motocorp, Lupin, Cairn India, Aurobindo Pharma, Tata Power, Titan, Siemens and BPCL will be reporting their numbers.

Also, the index of industrial production (IIP) data – a measure of the country’s factory output - for December is expected to be announced on February 9.

In corporate action, the face value of Daawat share will split from Rs 10 to Re 1 on February 7 and Gayatri Projects from Rs 10 to Rs 2 on February 10. On Monday,Dr Reddy's Labs is expected to react positively to its better-than-expected third quarter earnings."

The one thing that may have escaped everybody’s attention in the list of announcements made during the Union Budget 2017-18 was the 43 percent rise in allocation for hybrid and electric vehicles.

From Rs 122.9 crore allotted last year the government has set aside Rs 175 crore as subsidy to be given this year for purchase of hybrid and electric vehicles. The new allocation is itself more than a two-fold jump compared to the allocation during its inaugural year of 2015-16 when Rs 75 crore were due to be spent.

In an interview to Moneycontrol Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, Mahindra & Mahindra, said, “I am counting on this year being the year of electrics.”

“Mr (Piyush) Goyal [Minister of State, Independent Charge Power Coal, New and Renewable Energy] has announced that he would like the government of India to buy 1 lakh electric vehicles and by year 2030 the nation aims to be 100 percent electric. The Chairman of SoftBank, Masayosi Son announced that he would want to donate 1 lakh electric vehicles to Ola. Of course, if all of this happens it will exceed the global capacity of electric vehicles. So, even if 10 percent of this happens that will be a significant advancement of electric vehicles in India”, added Goenka.

A total of 118,118 hyrbid and electric vehicles have been given subsidies since the inception of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric (FAME) set up under the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan. This has resulted in a claimed saving of 8.47 million litres of fuel and a 21 million kilograms of CO2 reduction.

A total incentive of Rs 142 crore have been disbursed this far. A total of 46 models of two-wheelers and cars have received the benefit. Mahindra’s all-electric cargo van e-Supro has the highest incentive of Rs 187,000 while mild hybrids from Maruti Suzuki like the Ciaz and Ertiga have an incentive of Rs 13,000.

Not just car makers but commercial vehicle makers have also jumped onto the bandwagon especially since some State Transport Undertakings have shown keenness in running pure electric and hybrid buses.

“There is a push from both sides – passenger and commercial vehicles. There are buses being bought by states at a huge cost and also by the taxi segment”, Goenka added.

Tata Motors showcased two fully-electric buses on Wednesday priced in the range of Rs 1.6-2 crore along-side electric variants of the popular Super Ace, Magic Iris and Magic. The buses have on-board charging ports as well as WiFi.

The Tata Motors buses have a range of 150 kms with full load and takes eight hours to get fully charged. There is also an option of a flash charge which charges the roof-mounted batteries in 15 minutes. Tata Motors is working on developing fast charging technology for future generation electric vehicles.

In October last year Hinduja Group flagship company Ashok Leyland became the first commercial vehicle maker to launch an electric bus. Powered by Lithium-ion batteries the Circuit Bus has a range of 120 kms on a full charge and a top-speed of 75 kms an hour.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, Ravindra Pisharody, executive director (commercial vehicles), Tata Motors said, “Increasingly, we are getting very strong statements from the senior most in the ministry that they are going to look at operators who will be given the job of creating infrastructure. An operator who will be given the charge of opening infrastructure as well as operating it. So, his costs and amortisation are then recovered on a longer time frame.”"

Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol ResearchIn the immediate aftermath of demonetisation -- often called a surgical strike on black money -- every performance parameter of India Inc was checked for trauma. Nearly 90 days after the cash ban came into effect, with remonetisation happening at a faster clip, automobile sales data in January throws some interesting insights. While predictably the sequential growth has shown improvement across categories, demonetisation hadn’t impacted the smarter boys much. The back benchers need to put their own house in order rather than pointing an accusing finger at cash crunch. Urban India has weathered the storm well. Passenger cars and high-end two-wheelers have hardly felt the impact, except for a blip in the month following the event. Maruti with a much sought-after product portfolio and Tata Motors with its revamped offering, have zoomed without a scratch. Royal Enfield also seems to have struck the right cord with its targeted customers and have faced no headwind on account of the note ban. However, some of the other players, catering to the same segment, weren’t that lucky. As the numbers seem to suggest, for Bajaj Auto, M&M or Hyundai, the slowdown had preceded the event and they are yet to witness a turnaround. For Rural India, monsoon and healthy sowing activity was expected to have a positive rub-off on sales of tractors. However, rural-focused two-wheeler sales haven't exhibited a similar trend and would be an interesting space to look for early signs of recovery as remonetisation and return of farm income should start impacting sales positively. One of the most powerful indicators of macro recovery, namely, sales of commercial vehicles (feared to be the worst affected due to demonetisation) also appears to be coming back on track. The CV segment of Tata Motors, Eicher Volvo and Ashok Leyland have exhibited decent recovery. However, the jury is still out on what percentage could be attributed to recovery or pre-buying due to change in emission norms. Markets have clearly rewarded the smarter bunch: passenger vehicles, two-wheeler, and farm equipment space. With uncertainty looming over the extent of remonetisation of rural economy and return of rural consumer demand, some of the rural-focused entities like M&M and Hero MotoCorp have underperformed thereby widening the valuation gap with the leaders. The Budget bounties coupled with return of agrarian income makes this space interesting to monitor."

Bulls roared Wednesday after lots of expected factors like raising of securities transaction tax, services tax, and long term capital gains tax were left untouched by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Union Budget 2017. It not only pushed pushed Sensex up 486 points but also lifted the rupee by 39 paise.Abolishment of FIPB; more push to affordable housing, rural consumption, agriculture & infrastructure sector (by allotting Rs 3.9 lakh crore); keeping FY18 fiscal deficit target at 3.2 percent; indication of interest rate cut and lowering tax rate to 5 percent from 10 percent for personal income between Rs 2.5-5 lakh crore also boosted sentiment.

""We expect the Budget to buoy growth, bring down inflation and the interest rate and promote investment and financial savings. Speculation about the introduction of a long-term capital-gains tax on equities has been put to rest. Overall, this is an understated, but nuanced and intelligent Budget,"" Anand Rathi, Chairman, Anand Rathi Group said.

Lots of stocks from auto, FMCG, housing, banks to infra sectors participated in today's relief rally led by Union Budget 2017 but technology stocks (TCS down 2.7 percent and Infosys down 1.4 percent) continued to butcher due to HI-B visa woes.

Cigarette major ITC was the leading contributor to benchmarks' gains (that also touched record high intraday), up 4.5 percent as excise duty hike of 2.5-6 percent on various lengths of cigarettes was within the analysts' expectations limit of 8-10 percent.

PSU banks were other major drivers for this rally, with Nifty PSU Bank index rising 4 percent after the capital allocation of Rs 10,000 crore and also left the scope for more allocation (if needed) by government. SBI gained 4 percent.

L&T, BHEL, Engineers India etc gained 2-3 percent after the government allocated Rs 3.9 lakh crore for infrastructure spending.

Jaitley also left auto sector untouched, due to which Nifty Auto index gained 3.6 percent. Even stable January sales data boosted sentiment. Maruti Suzuki shares rallied 4.7 percent after volumes increased 27 percent in the month gone by YoY. Eicher Motors rallied 5 percent after a 50 percent jump in profit and 25 percent growth in Royal Enfield sales.

Mahindra & Mahindra climbed 4 percent after major push for rural consumption by government, though its January sales declined 10 percent due to demonetisation.

Real estate stocks Kolte-Patil (up 12 percent) and HDIL (up 6 percent) also participated in rally after big push to affordable housing in the Budget. The government has given infrastructure status to affordable housing. Housing finance companies HDFC, LIC Housing Finance, Gruh Finance and DHFL gained 3-6 percent.

Non-banking finance companies Bharat Financial Inclusion and Manappuram Finance gained 6-9 percent on credit support to rural sector and MSMEs announced by the government.

Road developers IRB Infrastructure, Dilip Buildcon and Ashoka Buildcon rose 2.5-6 percent after budgetary allocation for highways has been hiked by 13 percent to Rs 64,000 crore.

Idea Cellular shares declined 2 percent on profit booking after rising 63 percent in last 8 consecutive sessions as Vodafone and Aditya Birla Group company confirmed merger talks.Posted by Sunil Shankar Matkar"

Swaraj BaggonkarMoneycontrolThere was not a single thing in the budget which was done with a primary focus to win votes, says Pawan Goenka, Executive Director and President Mahindra & Mahindra.Edited excerpts from an interview:Q. Disappointment on no mention of FAME scheme?A. In fact the government has allotted Rs 175 crore under FAME scheme in the coming financial year compared to Rs 122.9 crore allotted this year. The earlier allotment is due to come to an end by end of March.

Q. But there was nothing on the scrappage of vehicles either.A. Nothing specific on scrappage yes. But government of India has intended to have a scrappage policy. But it will cost money and depending how aggressive they have decided to go after it it will cost a lot. Because my guess is that for a scrappage scheme to work an incentive of Rs 1 lakh per vehicle has to be given. So if it has to scrap 100,000 vehicles in a year that means it has to clear Rs 1,000 crore. Therefore in a year when the government is somewhat uncertain they would probably not want any new things.Q. There was so much push towards rural in the budget. Do you think rural consumption will get a boost.A. There was not a single thing in the budget which was done with a primary focus to win votes. So all the money that is spent on rural and agriculture is a part of the overall plan of the government to develop the rural sector. Secondly the budget did not offer anything new but instead laid emphasis on pushing forward what it had already started. And lastly there was nothing that could have upset anybody, it was a safe budget.Q. There is also a mention of contract farmingA. It is a very good thing because in agriculture one of the biggest problems that India has is our farm sizes are too small. And because of that the farm do not have economy of size. So contract farming allows aggregation of farms. So now there will be that somebody who will bring better technology and better yield to farms. And yet protect income of the farmer.Q. Would we see more participation from the corporates?A. It depends on what the final policy is. Right now contract farming is very restricted. One cannot do contract farming for more than three years and there is an upfront investment required in contract farming and one has to wait longer than that to get the returns unless it’s a cash crop.Q. Do you see pick-up in demand for M&M and the industry?A. There was a holding back of any major buying by the people. Now that budget is out of the way people will get on with the business. Another event which might have an impact on short term demand between now and July is the GST rates. And it will be good for us if GST rates are announced as early as possible.Q. Is demonetization totally behind us?A. A lot of demonetization impact has been cured. However there is something which is called momentum in our industry which has not come back yet. In September and October we were simply sprinting and a month later it came to a complete halt. And now it will take an effort to go back to earlier levels. My guess is that it will take two more months to reach there."

Malini BhuptaMoneycontrolIn uncertain times, defensive sectors are good places to hide, but a contrarian view this time around would be more profitable. Even though 2017 is expected to be a year of uncertainties, equity strategists are advising cyclical stocks over safe havens.While impact of GST rollout and pace of economic recovery after demonetisation are known domestic variables, Trumponomics and the impact of protectionist policies adopted by several developed economies remain key global uncertainties. In such challenging times, a good place to hide would be defensive sectors like consumer, pharmaceuticals and IT services, but this time around the market is betting on cyclicals, in the hope that infrastructure spending will get a boost in this year’s Budget.Don't expect consumption to revive anytime soonThe economy may be limping back to normalcy after high value currency notes were invalidated in November; consumer companies are not likely to see a 'U’ shaped recovery. Small wonder then that the market is placing its bets on cyclical stocks. While IDFC Securities expects relatively higher fiscal stimulus on the consumption side (compared to capex), it believes the move will only help bring consumption demand back to normal levels (which was dented by demonetization). Hence, the brokerage prefers non-consumption themes – B2B businesses, high dividend yield stories and businesses with stronger outlook outside the country.Earnings of cyclicals to outpace defensivesEarnings recovery in some sectors is another trigger for select cyclicals. Given that select commodity prices have been moving up, earnings trajectory of metal companies is expected to improve. Religare Capital Markets expects earnings growth of energy and metals to rise to 16.5 percent while IT is expected to report stagnant earnings. Cement, construction & infrastructure and capital goods are among the few sectors that are expected to report double-digit earnings growth. According to Motilal Oswal Securities, December quarter’s earnings growth would be driven by cyclicals – cement, capital goods and oil & gas are expected to post 24 percent, 59 percent and 42 percent earnings growth, respectively. Consequently, the share of defensives in overall earnings will also decline in FY17.Budget to give a leg-up to cyclicalsThe immediate trigger for cyclical stocks will come from the Budget, scheduled to be presented by the Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on February 1. By now it is an accepted fact that the government will deviate from the path of fiscal consolidation and stimulate the economy by transferring more money in the hands of tax payers to ease the pain of demonetisation. If this were to actually happen in a meaningful way, consumption would get a boost. But given the FM's limited fiscal room, a section of economists believe that the stimulus may come in the form of higher capital expenditure by the government.Morgan Stanley’s base case view is that the government will not use fiscal stimulus to revive domestic demand, considering the starting point of tight fiscal space. Sectoral analysts at the global investment bank expect the Budget to be positive for autos, cement & metals, consumer, Internet and e-commerce, media and real estate. Most economists and strategists do not expect remonetisation to substantially revive consumption to levels higher than the pre-note ban era.Scorecard for key stocksTop Performers of 2016 Hindalco (+83 percent), Yes Bank (+59 percent), Tata Steel (+51 percent), BPCL (+42 percent) and Power Grid (+30 percent).Worst performers of 2016Idea (-49 percent), BHEL (-28 percent), Aurobindo (-24 percent), Sun Pharma (-23 percent) and Bharti Infratel (-20 percent) were the worst performers.Winners for five straight yearsSix Nifty stocks – Eicher, Maruti, IndusInd Bank, Zee Entertainment, Asian Paints and Kotak Mahindra Bank – delivered positive returns for five straight years.Stocks that delivered negative returns for first time in five year.Stocks delivering negative returns for the first time in the last five years wereAurobindo, Lupin, M&M, HUL and HCL Tech."

Swaraj BaggonkarMoneycontrolWith an aim to give electric vehicles a boost the government is believed to be discussing the idea of allowing third-party companies to set up charging infrastructure.Insufficient subsidies from the government and lack of battery charging stations have been the two main reasons why electric vehicles have not gathered much traction so far in India.While the government has become serious about promoting clean technology vehicles such as hybrids and electric variants under the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan which provides subsidies for two and four-wheelers, there has been no word yet on plans to set up a charging infrastructure parallely.Speaking to Moneycontrol, Ravindra Pisharody, Executive Director (commercial vehicles), Tata Motors said, “Increasingly, we are getting very strong statements from the senior most in the ministry that they are going to look at operators who will be given the job of creating infrastructure.

The Heavy Industries Ministry has estimated a total requirement of about Rs 14,000 crore for the programme.Tata Motors is participating in a tender floated by the Himachal Pradesh government for supply of 50 fully-electric buses, which could ply on the ecologically sensitive Manali-Rohtang pass.Mumbai-based Mahindra & Mahindra is presently the only company to offer personal vehicles driven by electric motors.

Brexit, steep valuations and an unfavourable sale method adopted by debt-ridden Amtek Auto have become the main reasons behind the company’s unsuccessful bids to sell Tekfor, its German division.

Desperate to get rid of the huge debt of more than Rs 13,000 crore, Delhi-based Amtek has been trying to sell its forging company since October 2015 without much success. As many as seven bids were received by Amtek by October last year but the asking price, which is believed to be in the range of USD 800 million-USD 1 billion has disappointed the bidders. Britain's decision to exit from the Europe Union also hit the sale process. Amtek had bought the German company in 2013.

Amtek’s asset sale comes on the heels of Germany’s Hay Group going to a Japanese company for a knocked-down price last year. The Hay Group, which is a main rival of Amtek Auto's, was sold for just USD 563 million, nearly half the asking price sought by Amtek.

Mahindra & Mahindra’s Spanish partner CIE is one of the contenders in the fray for Tekfor. However, M&M is not in favour of participating in a ‘auction-like’ sale process. A Chinese company and a private equity company are believed to have expressed interest in the sale.

In a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange dated November 30, 2016 Amtek Auto informed that a joint Board comprising Amtek, Metalyst Forgings and Catsex Technologies approved infusion of fresh capital by investors.

The joint Board also agreed to reduce and restructure debt subject to approvals from lenders. It further agreed to monetise assets to support the restructuring.

Germany-based Amtek Tekfor Holding GmbH makes parts for transmissions, engines and drivelines. The company has five plants in Europe, two in South America, two in Asia and one in North America. Its clients include Volkswagen Group, Fiat, BMW, Daimler, to name a few."

Swaraj Baggonkar MoneycontrolUS President-elect Donald Trump’s stance on promoting local manufacturing will likely hit Indian-owned foreign auto companies such as Jaguar Land Rover and SsangYong Motor Company.

On Monday Trump warned German luxury car-making companies such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi about imposing a steep anti-import tax of 35 percent on vehicles imported to the US.

""If you want to build cars in the world, then I wish you all the best. You can build cars for the United States, but for every car that comes to the USA, you will pay 35 percent tax,"" Trump said to the German newspaper Bild.

Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover, generates 25 percent of its total volumes from the US market, making it the largest market for the two luxury brands, according to a presentation made by Tata Motors. However, it does not have a manufacturing or an assembly plant in that country.

If Trump indeed slaps such a steep tax on the imported luxury cars in the US it would make JLR models expensive thus hurting sales. The two brands, which generate over 90 percent of Tata Motors’ profits, recorded a growth of 25 percent in the US during the fiscal year ended December 2016.

Over the last few years JLR announced manufacturing plans in countries where costs are comparatively lower than in the US. These include India, China, Brazil, Slovakia and Austria. Besides, investments were also made at its mother plants in the UK.

""I would tell BMW that if you are building a factory in Mexico and plan to sell cars to the USA, without a 35 percent tax, then you can forget that,"" Trump said in the interview.

""Jaguar Land Rover is growing its global manufacturing footprint and regularly evaluates opportunities around the world. No decisions have been made,"" said a Jaguar Land Rover spokesperson in a reply to a questionnaire sent by Moneycontrol.

Similarly, Trump’s warning could upset plans of Mahindra & Mahindra-owned SsangYong Motor Company, which is looking at the US market as a ‘make-or-break’.

According to SsangYong’s Chief Executive Choi Johng-sik the company set a deadline of 2019 to enter the US market. Ssangyong currently has a vehicle manufacturing facility only in South Korea.

""It is true that there are many concerns about the US entry. We think the US project will make or break our company. So we'll have full discussions with Mahindra,"" Choi had said to reporters on the sidelines of the launch of Ssangyong Tivoli Air compact SUV last year.

At least 31 percent of SsangYong’s volumes comes from outside South Korea. Western Europe accounts for 44 percent of total export volumes, making it the largest market outside Korea, followed by 23 percent of South America."

Swaraj BaggonkarMoneycontrolGet your cheque books ready and your parking lot cleaned as at least 50 cars, sports and multi-utility vehicles including face-lifts and upgrades are set to hit showrooms throughout this year even as carmakers eagerly await a demand revival.After making merry in 2016 car makers ranging from budget king Maruti Suzuki to luxury leader Mercedes-Benz to sports car maker Porsche are leaving no stone unturned to lure new customers with a plethora of new launches.

New launches will target existing popular segments like hatchbacks and sedans as well as create new segments which can be classified under the broader crossover segment as consumers’ buying pattern continue to undergo dynamic changes. While conventional fuels like petrol and diesel will remain as the top choice, electric and hybrids will gather pace this year.

India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki who had a boisterous 2016 started the new year with the launch of the Ignis on Friday. The Delhi-based car market leader which has promised to launch 15 new products beginning 2015 and till 2020, will keep up the tempo with the launch of the powerful Baleno RS a few months later.

Tata Motors, the country fourth largest car maker, isn’t too far behind on the product front. The auto maker is planning to have as many as three new launches including the much-awaited compact sedan and a premium SUV Hexa. An automatic transmission variant of the Tiago is also lined up for 2017.Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), the country’s largest maker of SUVs, will roll out a new model that will replace the existing Xylo, a multi-purpose vehicle and will compete against the hugely successful Toyota Innova. Further, the Mumbai-based company is expected to also roll out an updated version of the Scorpio as well as electric version of some of its existing models.

French car maker Renault who has been kept busy following huge demand for the Kwid is expected to launch the Captur SUV in the second half of the year. The company has already rolled out 1 litre and automatic transmission variants of the Kwid in the market and is set to offer further derivatives of the car in the coming period. Korean car brand Hyundai which is the second largest car maker in the country, will launch the updated version of the Grand i10 as well as heavily reformed Verna perhaps in the second of the year. The company has had a quiet 2016 with no big bang launches with the exception of Tucson and Elantra. With the updated Verna Hyundai hopes to ride back to the numero uno position in the sedan segment from where it was dislodged by Honda City, the country’s highest selling mid-size sedan.

Under fire from Maruti Suzuki former leader in the compact SUV segment Ford will revamp the EcoSport for launch in the middle of the year. The Vitara Brezza snatched the lead from EcoSport in the less than 4 meters SUV segment. General Motors, which has become a fringe player in India, will launch the next-gen Chevrolet Beat and the compact car Chevrolet Essentia.

Action in the luxury segment comprising reigning champion Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Jaguar Land Rover, Volvo and BMW will continue unabated in 2017. Mercedes has promised to launch as many as nine new launches in 2017 while rivals Audi and BMW will launch nearly as much if not more products during the same year.

Lowering of entry price with the launch of smaller models has allowed luxury car making companies to tap customers at the lower end of the pyramid. More than 40,000 new luxury cars are sold in the Indian market annually which is just 1 per cent of the total new car market of India. This has provided luxury car makers lots of headroom for growth.

While new launches and the proposed roll out of Goods and Services Tax will light up the market what could prove to be a dampner would be the new safety norms which are set to be rolled out in later part of 2017. According to government regulations all new cars sold in the country will have to undergo mandatory crash test.

This is expected to push up overall cost of development of vehicles which will be passed on to consumers. Moreover, new norms with regards to mandatory fitment of airbags and antilock braking system will also push up costs. While this could pull down demand in the immediate period consumers are car makers have welcomed this step by the government."

Swaraj BaggonkarMoneycontrolCommercial vehicle makers are gearing up to initiate a steep price hike across trucks and buses from April 1 even as the industry continues to struggle with subdued demand conditions.

Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland, the two major players which control three-fifths of the domestic commercial vehicle market, will announce a hike of up to 10 percent across their entire range from April 1, 2017. The actual hike could be in the range of Rs 50,000-350,000 based on the price of the vehicle.

The hike will be as a result of the onset of the Bharat Stage IV (BSIV) emission norm that is due to be enforced from the beginning of the next financial year. Companies can continue to produce BSIII vehicles till March 31, 2017. To be sure BSIV has already been in operation in several cities but will now be extended to the entire country.

Ravindra Pisharody, executive director, Tata Motors said, “There would be an increase of 9-10 percent in prices of commercial vehicles following the adoption of BSIV.”

According to Pisharody the segment of medium and heavy commercial vehicles like tractor-trailers, tippers and multi-axle trucks will see the maximum impact as over 90 percent them are BSIII.

Tata Motors is India’s largest commercial vehicle manufacturer with a share of 43 percent. The Mumbai-based company launched a commercial pick-up truck Xenon Yodha in the first week of this month with a BSIII engine.

Rival, Chennai-based Ashok Leyland will also follow suit with an expected near similar hike across its range. The leader in bus segment had announced a hike of Rs 60,000-Rs1.25 lakh on January 1. The BSIV hike will be over and above the hike already announced.

Mahindra & Mahindra, the second largest commercial vehicle maker, raised its prices of light commercial vehicles in the range of Rs 1,500 to Rs 6000 with effect from January 1.

Government of India in a recent notification stated that all trucks and buses sold after April 1, 2017 will have to be equipped with airconditioned cabins. While all manufacturers presently offer airconditioning as an option there are very few takers for it.

“More than 80 percent of CV buyers do not opt for airconditioning because of higher vehicle operating costs. Trucks are not personal vehicles and are mostly driven by hired workers,” said a Tata Motors executive.

BSIV will lead to several mechanical changes made to the engine and powertrains sytems. Use of electronics will increase for pushing greater use of diagnosis as well as overall improvement in fuel efficiency. As a result overall costs will go up.

Due to this it is expected that there will be heavy increase in demand for BSIII vehicles in this quarter followed by a minimum of 10-12 percent drop in the first quarter of next financial year.

“Traditionally, whenever there has been a change in emission norm the preceding month or quarter witnesses heavy buying. These are preponed buys by customers done to beat the price hike. While there is a drop seen soon after it stabilises overtime,” added Pisharody."

Reflecting challenges faced by automobile industry in the wake of demonetisation, auto majors Hyundai Motor India, Mahindra & Mahindra and Ford India today reported decline in their domestic sales in December.

Other firms such as Tata Motors, Renault, Nissan and Volkswagen, however, reported increase in their Indian sales in December.

Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) said its domestic sales in December were at 40,057 units as against 41,861 units in the same month previous years, down 4.3 percent.

HMIL Senior Vice-President, Sales and Marketing, Rakesh Srivastava had stated that demonetisation impacted consumer sentiment creating a challenge and walk-ins at showrooms were down by around 40 percent while overall retail sales were down by 24-25 percent immediately after the note ban.

Retail sales had, however, picked up in December by 5 percent as compared with the same month previous year, he said while adding it might take a quarter to normalise.

Mahindra & Mahindra's sales in the domestic market were down 1.5 percent to 34,310 units last month as compared to 34,839 in the year-ago period.

""The auto industry continues to go through challenging times, grappling with the short-term effects of demonetisation as well as reduced and postponed purchase decisions. However, we believe there will be a gradual pick-up in demand starting next few months,"" M&M Chief Executive (auto division) Pravin Shah said in a statement.

Likewise, Ford India also saw its domestic sales dip by 6.04 percent to 5,566 units last month as against 5,924 units in the same month a year ago.

Madhuchanda DeyMoneycontrol ResearchWith Nifty a whisker away from its lifetime high and valuation touching 21X FY17P and 18X FY18P earnings, the Street looks cautious. Is it time to take money off the table? Or, is it time to be ready with the shopping list and wait patiently for buying opportunities as markets gyrate amid headwinds of state election results and US Fed’s interest rate action? Our analysis suggests that while Nifty may be on cloud 9, some stocks haven’t yet exhibited similar exuberance. They still possess sound long-term potential.1) Although Larsen & Toubro had given a downward revision for growth (for revenue and order inflows), we do see a few tailwinds for the engineering major over the coming two-three years driven by government-driven expenditure in areas like port-connectivity, railways, smart cities, metros and downstream oil etc. Stability in oil prices should augur well for the international business and the defence opportunity could turn out to be an icing on the cake. With an expected earnings CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 29 percent, the valuation at 19X FY18P earnings for the company deserves a closer look.2) ITC hasn’t disappointed investors in the past one year. While government is unlikely to show any sympathy to cigarette manufacturers, implementation of GST will lead to some medium-term clarity on taxation. The company continues to build a high quality franchise in other businesses beyond cigarettes. We are comforted by the relative value that the stock offers - 27X FY18 P earnings, at 25 percent discount to the FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) universe.3) Dr Reddy has significantly under-performed the market in the past one year, courtesy the warning letter by US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) for three of its facilities. A successful resolution (inspection is due shortly) should pave the way for approvals and earnings growth. Dr Reddy, in our opinion, is well suited to adapt to the transition from low-risk pure generics to an innovation-led model and valuation at 23X FY18 earnings provides the requisite margin of safety.4) Over the past five years, Aurobindo Pharma has transformed from an API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) maker to a formulation company, but its valuation hasn’t caught up yet. The company has lined up a strong launch pipeline in the US, sufficient to offset competitive pressures on existing portfolio. The acquisition of Actavis’ EU business has provided the company with the scale in the EU business and its biosimilar acquisition should help close the gap with competition. Finally, the stock is still available at 14.3X FY18P earnings.5) Delay in resolution at its key facility in Halol by US FDA and heightened price erosion in Taro (Sun’s US subsidiary) have resulted in significant under performance of Sun Pharma. While the management doesn’t foresee immediate resolution of US FDA issues, stabilization of India (highly profitable) and emerging market business, material progress in its speciality strategy (using part of the Ranbaxy synergies in investment for Specialty build out) points to earnings growth post a successful resolution. The transition from pure generics to speciality should deserve attention and the undemanding valuation (22X FY18P earnings) and near-term weakness could provide an entry opportunity.6) ICICI Bank has lagged its private sector peers on account of asset quality woes. While there hasn’t been any remarkable changes in the picture, in the latest quarter, slippages were primarily from the ‘below investment grade’ book. A couple of quarters of pain notwithstanding, we expect slippages to peak out. The bank’s strong retail franchise, multi-channel distribution network, wide product range, strong brand and avenues to raise resources through dilution in established subsidiaries make us positive at the current valuation of 1.8x FY18P adjusted book.7) State Bank of India has one of the best provision covers amongst public sector banks. With a gradual incremental decline in slippage, we feel the worst is behind with respect to asset quality woes. Through SBI, investors get to participate in a well-capitalised banking leader, highly geared to economic upcycle with a strong retail franchise at an undemanding valuation of 1.3X FY18P adjusted book.8) Amid structural issues and external risks, we still pin hopes on a few information technology stocks like Tech Mahindra that is showing traction in its key vertical telecom, reporting deal wins in its enterprise segment and quotes at an attractive valuation of 13X FY18P earnings.9) Finally, Mahindra & Mahindra hasn’t quite found favour with the bourses in the past one year, thanks to the hyper competition from rivals and its late entry into the compact SUV (sport utility vehicle) space alongside regulatory concerns pertaining to diesel vehicles. However, the more profitable farm equipment (tractor) business (44 percent market share) is showing decent traction and should maintain momentum given the encouraging reports of crop sowing so far. Valuation at 14.6X FY18P core earnings lends comfort."

Benchmark indices staged smart come back in the week gone by, recouping previous week's losses on hopes of tax sops in the Union Budget and positive developments in PM's speech especially after the end of 50 days since the announcement of demonetisation. FMCG, IT and banks stocks helped the Nifty gain 2.5 percent at 8185.80 during the week.

The recovery after sell-off amid consolidation and low volumes indicated that the market may have found bottom for the time being or at least till the Union Budget, experts feel.

They expect the market to inch higher further on hopes of tax sops in the Union Budget despite expectations of weak quarterly earnings due to demonetisation and expected announcement of US policies by the US president-elect Donald Trump. Even the year 2017 is likely to be positive for the market with analysts expecting double digit returns, especially after a 3 percent rally that took place in 2016 despite unexpected events such as Brexit, Donald Trump's win, demonetisation and OPEC & non-OPEC countries' agreement for oil production cut.

Dilip Bhat of Prabhudas Lilladher says he expects some kind of a pre-Budget rally. This rally will largely pin its hopes on PM assuaging sentiments in terms of taxes, he feels.

From the Rs 15 lakh crore money that has come back into the banking system after the note ban, some of it will percolate into the market; and it will provide a tailwind, Bhat says.

Jan Dehn of Ashmore, who finds Indian markets attractive, both from an equity and fixed income perspective, says though the execution of demonetisation hasn't been as smooth as expected, this is a temporary aberration. The Indian economy will come out of it without any lasting damage and come out in a stronger place; the underlying fundamentals will remain solid, he believes.

He feels FIIs, who have been net sellers in December quarter, will make a comeback. Time will show that neither Donald Trump nor demonetisation will have adverse fundamental implications for India. Investors must view underperformance as an opportunity to add to exposures, he says.

FIIs will be back into the market after their Christmas holiday. They net sold Rs 31,128.61 crore worth of equities in October-December quarter, especially after demonetisation, US elections & Federal Reserve's hawkish commentary. In 2016, FIIs bought only Rs 18,195.73 crore worth of shares while DIIs were quite supportive, making Rs 35,362.56 crore worth of buying.

In 2016, the NSE benchmark surged 3 percent, underperforming the Midcap that gained 8 percent. The Metal index was the biggest gainer, up 45 percent followed by Bank (up 7.4 percent) and Auto (up 11 percent) whereas IT lost 7 percent and Pharma shed 14 percent.

In the coming week, the market on Monday will first react to PM's speech and auto sales data.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation today evening (December 31). Key points that are likely to be watched in the speech - the impact of demonetisation, tax sops and UP elections.

Auto companies (Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Auto, Hero Motocorp, Eicher Motors, TVS Motor and Ashok Leyland) will announce December sales data on January 1. The full impact of demonetisation is likely to be seen.

Earnings season will begin next week with small companies like GM Breweries, Chartered Logistics, Prime Securities and Manaksia Industries.

In corporate action, JSW Steel will start trading ex-split from January 4. Jagran Prakashan and Apar Industries will have board meeting to consider the buyback of shares on January 5 & 6, respectively. NBCC will consider bonus issue on January 4."

Dhirendra TripathiMoneycontrol Patparganj Industrial Estate in eastern part of the national capital is home to scores of family-run, small and medium proprietary businesses. Car dealership is one of them. A vehicle manufacturer not having a dealer here is an exception. It’s 4 pm and December is drawing to a close. The last month of the year isn’t the same anymore in Delhi. The day is sunnier than usual and warmer as well. The deadline for the most debated and dissected subject in the country for over a month and a half – demonetization – is coming to a close. Outside the dealer showrooms, the missing chill in the air and the chill in business activity are both palpable. But step inside, the mood isn’t so sombre. The lull has given way to cautious optimism -- new normal being set, fresh paradigms being shaped. At some of them, life is actually business as usual. Prashant Khattar, senior sales consultant at Bagga Link Motors Ltd, one of the largest dealers of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, can't help feeling a bit smug. His showroom was bustling with customers when this correspondent went to meet him.When asked how the sales are as the year and demonetization come to a close, he says, “Aap khud hee dekh lo. Kuchh fark padaa hai kya?” (See for yourself. Has it made a difference?) When pressed, he admits December sales have been affected but not more than 5-10 percent, but insists things are getting back to normal faster than he had anticipated. But then, the stuff Khattar sells has lorded over more than half the passenger car market for years now. The gradient of decline in December sales is a bit steeper when Rajkumar Sharma, manager of sales and operations at Renault dealer Avia Auto Services Pvt Ltd, gets talking. Sharma shares some interesting insights about changing dynamics of car sales and financing post demonetisation. “Most people are now going for finance option,"" Sharma tells moneycontrol.com.""Let’s say if 30-40 people out of 100 were opting for finance earlier, as many as 70 are now going for it,” he says, adding that December sales could be down by as much as 20 percent from last year but life is getting back to normal. Both Khattar and Sharma say the impact of demonetization was most felt till December 15-20 after which queries started converting into sales. “Cash is totally out now”, says Sharma, a view shared by O. P. Mishra, assistant manager of sales at Uttam Toyota. “Everybody is now going for finance with very few choosing cheque or an online option. People are now scared that making any down payment, even if it is cheque, could attract scrutiny of the income tax department,” Sharma says. He says private sector banks were earlier financing 85-90 percent of the vehicle’s ex-showroom price but were now giving 100 percent finance for on-road price. Khattar says while banks were now willing to fully finance government and public sector employees, Form 16 reflecting a salary income of Rs. 500,000 is what was needed for a private sector person to get 100% finance. “We are giving 100 percent finance to government and public sector staff and 85 percent to private. In any case, we ask for a CIBIL score of 700,” says the branch manager at State Bank of India’s premium branch in Shreshtha Vihar. Talk to Deepak Pathak, sales manager at Mahindra & Mahindra dealer Shiva Auto Car (I) Pvt Ltd, and he makes you jog your memory. “We are actually better off from last year. Remember the National Green Tribunal order banning diesel vehicles of over 2000 cc? ” he asks. Both M&M and Toyota have portfolios skewed towards diesel. Shivraj Singh, customer advisor at Patparganj outlet of Tata Motors Ltd’s subsidiary Concorde Motors India Ltd, says overall December sales could suffer as much as 20percent but the mood is positive again. So it is at Asco Motors, a dealer for Royal Enfield motorcycles, where the sales representative says the worst is over. The same is not as much shared by Vivek Pandey, branch in-charge at G. K. Motors Pvt Ltd, a dealer of TVS Motor Company Ltd. Pandey wears a glum look. Sales at his TVS outlet -- away from the industrial estate -- used to number around 50 units per month. He says they are down to 30 since the November 8 enforcement of demonetization. It’s 6 in the evening but no sight of any prospective customer is seen. The staff at Sunrise Autoworld Pvt Ltd, a dealer for Hyundai Motors India Ltd, is too busy. They offer water, tea and coffee as small mercies but their officials have little time to talk, engaged as they are with prospective buyers. The buzz is slowly getting back here too. “Commercial vehicles like Indigo and Indica are selling more where only Rs. 50,000 payment has to be made and the rest is all financed,” Singh says. His statement could be a reflection of the slow but fundamental shift in the automobile industry -- think Ola and Uber. That’s a bigger demon than demonetization!"

Homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra plans to increase prices of its vehicles by up to Rs 26,500 from January as it looks to partially offset rising input costs.

""We plan to increase prices of our passenger and commercial vehicles in the range of 0.5 to 1.1 per cent from next month. Prices of passenger vehicles would go up in the range of Rs 3,000 to Rs 26,500 depending upon the model,"" M&M Chief Executive (Auto Division) Pravin Shah told PTI.

The ex-showroom prices of its small commercial vehicles (up to 3.5 tonnes) would also increase in the range of Rs 1,500 to Rs 6,000 from January, he added.

Justifying the reasons for the price hike, he said that input costs have been soaring due to escalation of prices of various materials including precious metals.

""Besides, cost of fuel has also gone up leading to increase in freight costs. Also, there has been an impact of changing regulatory requirements,"" Shah said.

The Mumbai-based company sells a range of passenger vehicles ranging from KUV100 to premium SUV Rexton, priced between Rs 4.58 lakh to around Rs 24.86 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).

It also markets a range of small commercial vehicles, including three wheelers and LCVs like Alfa and Imperio priced between Rs 1.76 lakh and Rs 7.35 lakh (ex-showroom Mumbai).

Auto companies such as Hyundai Motor India, Nissan, Renault, Toyota, Tata Motors, Mercedes Benz and Isuzu have already announced hike in prices from January to offset higher input costs and adverse impact of foreign exchange fluctuations.

Two-wheeler major Bajaj Auto has also announced a hike in prices of its bikes by up to Rs 1,500 from next month. PTI MSS RKL JM ."

Moneycontrol BureauDecember is the time when cars makers usually take a production break. However, this time around manufacturers will shut shop for a slightly longer time due to demonetisation. All major players – Maruti, Hyundai, M&M and Honda – will close manufacturing units this month and the next. While insiders are blaming demonetisation for the extended shutdown, Maruti and Hyundai have said it is as per previous plans, mentions a report in The Economic Times. Since implementation of demonetization last month, automakers have seen drop in demand, which has led to accumulation of inventory. The products are moving out of dealer stores at a slower rate. Loan disbursals too have slowed down due to extra pressure in banks. In November, passenger vehicle sales grew only 1.82 percent, lowest since February. Two-wheelers sales fell by 6 percent while commercial vehicle sales fell about 12 percent, as per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers’ (SIAM) data. While experts say that this is a temporary phenomenon, real picture will be revealed once manufacturing resumes and demand picks-up."

Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol ResearchThere was an unusual excitement about monthly auto sales numbers this time around. Not just equity analysts and investors tracking auto stocks, but economists and corporate circles too were eagerly awaiting November sales data for the first signs of the impact of demonetisation at the ground level. Before we look at the auto sales numbers, it needs to be pointed out that the numbers reported by companies are sales to distributors and are not actual sales. Having said that these numbers do highlight the stress points in the industry. Maruti Suzuki’s numbers seem to have been the least affected. Sales for November grew 12.2 percent year-on-year and 1.3 percent month-on-month. What these numbers do not highlight is the build-up of inventory at the dealer’s end which has gone up by one week. The impact of inventory build-up will be seen this month. To Maruti’s credit, overall growth was despite a fall in exports. However, what comes out clearly from the auto sales numbers is that rural India is hurting the most from demonetization. Mahindra & Mahindra, the biggest sport utility vehicle player in the country has its customer base largely in rural India. The company posted a 38.8 percent drop in its sales as compared to the previous month and a 24.3 percent drop over previous year. Tractor sales for Mahindra & Mahindra crashed 61.8 percent over October 2016 while it fell by 20.5 percent over the previous month. Explaining the drop in tractor sales, the company’s officials said that the first de-growth in November was on account of a shift in festive season and added effect of demonetisation. Morgan Stanley conducted a channel check and found out that most tractor dealers were witnessing a drop in sales of 50-75 percent. Since farmers had not received cash for their kharif crop, high value items like tractor purchase has been put on hold. Rural India is largely a cash-based economy, where most purchases are completely in cash, including the road tax paid to the authorities. Similar stress was also visible in truck manufacturer Ashok Leyland which saw its sales fall by 23.6 percent, while tractor sales from Escorts posted a drop in sales of 45.8 percent. Tata Motors, though posted a flat sales numbers on a year-on-year basis but recorded a 26.3 percent drop in sales over the previous month. A similar tale is also visible in the two-wheeler segment all of whom have reported double digit month on month sales drop. TVS Motor reported a fall of 27 percent while Bajaj Auto and Hero Motocorp posted a fall of 12 percent each. According to Morgan Stanley 50-60 percent of two-wheeler sales happen through cash transactions, especially in small towns and rural areas. While the scenario might look bleak, automobile companies have adopted new strategies to cope with the slowdown. Almost all auto players across segments are offering deep discounts. Noting that the main issue is making the down payment, which in many cases was in cash, companies are now offering financing schemes with zero down payment. These schemes seem to work as many dealers have reported that sales are back to between 80-85 percent of normal monthly sales. Auto sector is normally considered as a credible indicator of the changing trends in economic growth. After an initial dip, the sector has shown promise of coming back on its feet. It’s only a matter of time before other sectors follow."

As overall auto sales data for the month of November was mixed analysts say December month will be important for auto sales data because demonetisation impact is likely to ease while for commercial vehicle business, next three-four months will be key, especially ahead of change in emission norms as after that vehicle prices will increase.

""We expect the next 3-4 months to be extremely volatile for commercial vehicle industry as the negative effects of demonetisation could be partially offset by a pre-buy ahead of the introduction of higher emission norms from April-2017,"" Deutsche Bank said.Deutsche has hold rating on Tata Motors with a target price of Rs 500 and Eicher Motors with a target of Rs 20,000 while it has buy rating on M&M with a target of Rs 1,400.

Nomura said another concern is that, as per current notification by government, BSIII trucks cannot be 'registered"" after April 1, 2017. Manufacturers want this to be ""production"" deadline as has been the case in the past. Otherwise, there will not be enough time to pre-buy and production switch over will be required by January-February 2017.

With maintaining Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors and Tata Motors as preferred picks in auto sector, Nomura said for Tata Motors, China luxury tax impact on EBITDA is likely to be less than 1 percent even if around 20 percent of buyers switch from Range Rover to Range Rover Sport.

China has imposed a 10 percent luxury tax on vehicles priced above CNY 1.3 million. In the case of JLR, only Range Rover retails at a price of more than CNY 1.58 million and is likely to be impacted. However, the impact is likely to be minimal given that it contributes around 2.4 percent of UK production, the brokerage house said.

Goldman Sachs said wholesale dispatches in categories such as commercial vehicles, cars and two-wheelers have surprised with only a limited drop, given the sharp fall in demand post demonetisation.

This it believes is driven by restoration of channel inventory post robust festive sales in October 2016 and original equipment manufacturers passing on the inventory pain to dealers. It expects a marked correction in December 2016.

Goldman has retained buy rating on Eicher Motors, Maruti Suzuki, TVS Motor and Ashok Leyland while Bajaj Auto and Hero Motocorp are on its sell list. Its rating on Tata Motors and M&M remained neutral.Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki, Eicher Motors and to some extent Ashok Leyland showed good performance but impact of currency demonetisation was largely seen in Bajaj Auto, Hero Motocorp, TVS Motor, Tata Motors and M&M.

Channel re-stocking after festive season and continued waiting period for Baleno & Vitara Brezza helped Maruti to outperform in November, showing 12.2 percent sales growth YoY. Eicher Motors maintained its lead in 2-wheeler space, registering a 41 percent growth despite 8 percent decline in bookings compared with September-October average.

In a conference call, Eicher said it has not seen any material cancellation or postponement of demand and has also not participated in any discounts etc to boost demand. However, financing share has gone up from 35-40 percent earlier to 43 percent, share of banking channel used (cheques etc) has increased from less than 25 percent earlier to 50 percent now, while cash purchases have declined from around 40 percent to 10 percent.

However, medium & heavy commercial vehicles industry disappointed in the month gone by, with volumes down 12 percent. After 17 percent growth in October, Ashok Leyland's growth slowed down to 10 percent while Tata Motors reported a steep 23 percent decline (though Tiago lifted passenger vehicle sales 22 percent), and VECV showed 13 percent drop in overall CV volumes.

Commercial vehicle companies' commentary indicated that fleet owners have deferred purchases due to a cash crunch and this can keep near-term demand muted.

Mahindra & Mahindra hit the hardest not only on auto front but also in tractor business, down 21-22 percent due to severe cash crunch in rural parts of the country, which contributed the most to its overall business. In two-wheeler space, Hero Motocorp's sales declined 12.9 percent, TVS Motors down 0.5 percent and Bajaj Auto slipped 13 percent."

Amid speculations of the adverse impact of demonetisation on the economy, three of the four automobile companies that reported November monthly sales numbers seemed to have either positively surprised or posted in-line results.

Contrary to expectation, India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki reported 12.2 percent year-on-year increase in total sales to 1.35 lakh units helped by high waiting period in some of its latest hot-selling models like Vitara Brezza and Baleno.

Pranoy Kurian of IDBI Capital Markets & Securities estimates nearly 20 percent of Maruti’s volumes is fairly immune to the currency crunch situation. The company, he told CNBC-TV18 in an interview today, is extending various offers like zero or cashless down payments to help ease payment glitches for the balance 80 percent.

Mahindra & Mahindra, on the other hand, saw its auto sales dip 22 percent YoY to 32,499 units. The company’s management blamed it on a shift in festive season and demonetization. M&M’s tractor business was also under severe pressure.Sales numbers of Eicher Motors, the manufacturer of high-end Royal Enfield motorcycles, also did not reflect any impact of demonetisation. In fact, Royal Enfield surprised with total sales jump of 41 percent YoY to 57,313 units in November. The point to be noted in these numbers, according to Kurian, was the jump in sales of motorcycles over 350cc, which is usually muted.Exports, which remained unaffected by the 'demon effect', showed a strong growth. For M&M exports increased 22 percent to 2,687 units in the month gone by. Similarly, Royal Enfield saw its exports rising a whopping 222 percent year-on-year to 1,470 units.

Commercial vehicles was one of the segments that was expected to be hit the most. However, even that segment seems to have dodged it at least in the month under question with Ashok Leyland reporting 7 percent YoY.However, it now remains to be seen if the awaited numbers of the remaining auto companies -- TVS, Hero, Bajaj and Tata Motors -- prove to be equally positive. As Sanjeev Prasad, Senior Executive Director and Co-Head of Kotak Institutional Equities says depending on which segments one is looking at, there could be an impact on an average of about two to three quarters.

In an interview to CNBC-TV18 earlier today, Prasad said commercial vehicles (CV) could see a more lasting impact as a lot of freight operators will have to review their business models as to whether they want to continue in their old model of dealing in black, in cash or want to become part of the formal economy. This will mean freight tariffs have to go up and it is not easy to raise tariffs at a time when demand environment is not very conducive anywhere."

Billionaire Sajjan Jindal's steel-to-power JSW Group plans to diversify into electric car manufacturing, two sources told Reuters, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government boosts support for non-polluting vehicles.

Electric vehicles that use expensive batteries have failed to take off in cost-conscious and power-deficient India, despite enjoying incentives like low taxes from the government that has set a goal of raising the number of such vehicles to up to 7 million units by 2020, from just around 20,000 now.

But debt-laden JSW believes government help - as promised by Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari on a visit to US electric car maker Tesla Motors' factory near California this year - and its own supply of steel can make its cars more competitive, said one of the sources with knowledge of the matter.

Mahindra and Mahindra is the only Indian firm that makes electric cars, but sales have been softer than expected.

JSW's electric car plans have been endorsed by Gadkari, said the source. Gadkari, in his US visit, offered to help Tesla set up plants in India and seek local partners, according to a statement from his ministry.

Gadkari could not be reached for comment.

Another source close to JSW said the company was ""aiming for technology like Tesla"" but declined to say if a tie-up with the US carmaker was on the cards. Tesla could not be reached for comment outside regular US business hours.

JSW has already set up a team of around eight officials working on the car project for the past few months, and Jindal has interviewed a handful of Indian-born automobile executives to head the division, including one official with Nissan in Japan, said the first source.

The CEO of the division is likely to start in the next fiscal year and further details will be worked out after that, according to the source.

""JSW wants to become a diversified player like the Tatas,"" the source said, referring to the USD100-billion steel-to-software Tata empire . ""For Jindal this is a serious business. Money is not an issue.""

Seshagiri Rao, finance head of the JSW Group that is one of India's most indebted conglomerates, said he did ""not want to comment at this stage"".

The second source said JSW had also been talking to officials at the heavy industries ministry about setting up charging stations across the country.

It is not clear if JSW plans to build the charging points, but the ministry says on its website that it could spend around USD2 billion by 2020 to increase the penetration of electric vehicles, including by ""promoting charging infrastructure"".

An official at the ministry, who did not want to be named, confirmed that JSW had discussed the plans with it although no final proposal had been made yet.

Experts say it will be difficult for any new company to crack the Indian electric car market.

""I don't understand how a new player coming into a market seen as insensitive to the environment can make profits in that trade,"" said Anil Sharma, principal analyst at consultant IHS Automotive, calling such a move an ""audacious attempt""."

Mahindra & Mahindra today opened its Rs 150 crore spare parts warehouse in Jaipur to cater to customers in north and north western regions of the country for both automotive and tractor spare parts.

Spread on 11-acre plot with an additional 5 acres for future expansion, the warehouse aims to significantly reduce the order processing time for North India customers.

The processing time for the availability of spare parts and distance-to-market is expected to take less than 4 days.

M&M will procure spare parts from over 1,000 vendors and nine plants for the new facility, which was formally inaugurated today by the company's Managing Director Pawan Goenka.

With an investment of Rs 150 crore, it will generate over 450 direct and indirect jobs.

""At Mahindra we are committed towards creating awareness and ensuring availability of original spares among our customers and to that extent, the company is reasonably insulated from the threat of counterfeit spares,"" M&M Chief Purchase Officer Automotive & Farm Equipment Sectors Hemant Sikka said.

The warehouse at Mahindra World City (MWC, Jaipur is part of the company's expansion strategy and going forward it will create a network of spare parts warehouses in West Bengal and the southern states, he added."

Moneycontrol Bureau

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on November 8, announced a ban on legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, to curb black money. Since then, an acute liquidity crunch has hit not only the public but also for various industries and sectors.

Analysts say consumption will get hit for 2-3 months and may delay earnings recovery -- which was earlier expected to take place by the second half of FY17 -- to H2FY18. Economic growth in FY17 is also likely to be impacted.

Deutsche Bank says it expects demonetisation to impact auto, steel and non-banking finance companies but PSU banks will gain the most as liquidity will increase through deposits. State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, alone collected more than Rs 1.35 lakh crore through deposits after demonetisation move.

Against the current backdrop, Motilal Oswal expects Q3FY17 earnings to be impacted the most and, thus, the earnings recovery thesis of 2HFY17 is now in jeopardy. It believes autos, FMCG, retail, consumer durables, mid-caps, cement, telecom and NBFC could see earnings downgrades for FY17.

Let's check out sectors and stocks that will have negative or positive impact of demonetisation (Source: Deutsche Bank):

Auto

Two-wheeler companies' sales are likely to hit the most in near term, especially Hero Motocorp, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor etc. Used vehicles sales may also collapse in short term while four-wheelers, commercial vehicles and tractors sales may not see major impact.

Deutsche cut EPS forecasts and target prices by 2-15 percent for companies under its coverage. For the domestic-focused OEMs like Maruti, Hero Motocorp, M&M, Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor and Ashok Leyland, the cut is around 6-18 percent. For companies with significant global exposure (Tata Motors, Bharat Forge and Motherson Sumi), the cut in earnings is minimal.

Banking

The brokerage house says demonetisation will lead to a 5 percent pickup in deposit growth (9-10 percent in near term) and CASA ratios expanding 200 bps over 12 months; lower yields enhancing bond gains; a growth slowdown, mainly in retail, with the impact on private banks neutralising deposit gains; and a slight, transient NPL pick-up.

More near-term benefits are likely for public sector banks and neutral for private banks. Deutsche raised earnings estimates by 7-21 percent for PSBs (FY18), with marginal changes for private banks and also raised target prices for PSBs. Top picks are SBI, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank.

Oil & gas

The demonetization of high denomination currency should only have a marginal impact on the Indian oil & gas sector, the brokerage house says. It sees a marginally adverse medium-term impact on sales of petroleum products. It reiterated its preference for refiners (HPCL, BPCL and IOC) in the oil sector and Petronet LNG among the gas utilities.

Metal & mining

Deutsche expects adverse impact on property investment, automobile, and white goods demand in the near term, which will likely affect 2HFY17 earnings, especially for steel. The earnings impact for non-ferrous should be moderate, as pricing is LME linked and exposure to these segments is low, it says.

It cut FY17 earnings for India steel by 12-152 percent, cut target prices by 1-24 percent, and reiterated preference for non-ferrous.

Pharma

The brokerage house believes sentiment will remain positive for companies that have lower exposure to Indian sales. It says relaxed norms for retail would limit the impact and expects Indian sales growth to normalise by Q4FY17.

Utilities & industrials

Demonetisation is unlikely to have any direct impact on the power utilities and industrials sectors.

NBFCs

For NBFCs (ex-housing finance companies - HFCs), the near-term impact of demonetisation will be on collections, as a significant component of the same happens in cash, the brokerage house says, adding a lack of cash in the economy is also likely to affect near term loan demand.

For the HFCs, collection is all via non-cash channels, but a likely property price correction, on lower unaccounted cash, could affect loan demand for the HFCs.

Hence, Deutsche lowered FY17 earnings by 4-11 percent and target prices by 3-20 percent. However, as a consequence of this scheme, system liquidity will rise, and inflation and interest rates will fall, which should lead to lower borrowing costs for the NBFCs in FY18, it says. Top picks are Shriram Transport Finance and HDFC."

Mahindra and Mahindra today revamped its top deck by elevating Pawan Goenka as managing director while redesignating Anand Mahindra as executive chairman.

Mahindra currently is the group chairman and managing director while Goenka is president for automotive division and group executive director.

""The promotion is in line with the practice followed by companies across the Mahindra Group, where the position of MD/CEO is distinct from that of the chairman and that Mahindra as the executive chairman will continue to oversee, and be responsible for shaping, the growth strategies of the company and its portfolio of investments,"" it said a statement.

""Pawan has played a major role in M&M's growth in the post-liberalisation era. His elevation as MD is a fitting recognition not only of his vast experience and domain knowledge in the mobility space and his many past achievements, but also of the eminent role that he currently plays in the company,"" Mahindra said.

Goenka joined Mahindra as general manager, R&D in 1993, after working for General Motors in Detroit for 14 years and was instrumental in growing its R&D capability and also the launch of its flagship Scorpio.

He was elevated as president of the automotive division in 2005, head of automotive and farm equipment vertical in 2010 and as executive director on the board in 2013.

Goenka is also on the board of governors of IIT Madras as the chairman.

Commenting on his elevation, Goenka said he was humbled by the move.

""When I joined the group 23 years ago, I could never have imagined that one day I would be entrusted with this responsibility,"" he said."

Homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra today reported a 27 percent jump in its standalone net profit to Rs 1,163.27 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, 2016.

The company had posted standalone net profit of Rs 915.38 crore in the same quarter last fiscal, M&M said in a BSE filing.

The firm's total standalone revenue from operations stood at Rs 11,363.63 crore during the period under review as against Rs 9,834.41 crore in the year-ago quarter, up 15.56 percent.

Unit volume sales during the quarter stood at 1,14,795, up 11.6 percent. Utility vehicles sales were at 52,287 units, up 15.6 percent from the year-ago period.

Domestic tractor sales during the second quarter were at 57,863 units, up 36.9 percent from the same period last fiscal, the company said.

M&M said its total vehicle exports were higher by 13.3 at 15,181 units during the second quarter.

On the outlook, the company said, abundant and well spread monsoon will help revive farm income and push up private consumption.

""Prices of key agricultural inputs have stabilised which signals that farmer balance sheets are on the mend now and this will help revive the overall rural economy,"" it said.

The company said, the 7th Pay Commission and OROP have put money in the pockets of government employees and pensioners which will further help demand.

""The lagged effects of the interest rates cuts by RBI along with increased transmission of lower interest rates will also be supportive of consumption. All of these bode well for broad-based consumption-led growth in coming quarters,"" M&M said.

Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd were trading at Rs 1,287 apiece, down 2.60 percent from the previous close on BSE."

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) today expanded its electric vehicle portfolio with the launch of e20 Plus hatchback priced at Rs 5.46 lakh to Rs 8.46 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).

The company has marked the entry level P2 variant of the vehicle for fleet owners but hasn't disclosed its price yet.

The other variants -- P4, P6, and P8 -- are priced at Rs 5.46 lakh, Rs 5.95 lakh and Rs 8.46 lakh respectively.

""As the pioneers in the integrated and electric mobility solutions in India, it has always been our endeavour to make electric vehicles more accessible across segments,"" M&M Executive Director Pawan Goenka told reporters here.

The launch of e20 Plus marks the company's foray into the mass market electric city car segment, he added.

The vehicle comes with a range of 140 kms on one single charge and achieves a top speed of 85 kmph.

The company, which has already invested around Rs 600 crore on developing electric technology, already sells three vehicles -- e20, eVerito and eSupro.

It is also developing a bigger electric 80 KW powertrain which would be able to run bigger vehicles going forward, Goenka said.

M&M president and chief executive (Automotive) Pravin Shah said that the e20 Plus is an amalgamation of advancements in automotive technology, electronics and information technology.

""As a listening organisation, the e20 Plus has been evolved keeping in mind the feedback from our potential customers,"" he added.

The e20 Plus is primarily meant for city commuting and comes with various features such as easy hone charging, hill assist, reverse camera, charging ports and smartphone connectivity among others.

Since launching its first electric product-- e20 in March 2013 -- the company has so far sold around 3,000 units in the country."

Patanjali Yogpeeth and FMCG firm Dabur have decided to invest ""in a big way"" in Assam, while auto major Mahindra and Mahindra has expressed interest in setting up a manufacturing plant, the state government said.

Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal discussed these investment proposals at a meeting held with state Industry and Commerce Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary and senior officials on 'ease of doing business', an official release said.

""Citing examples indicating a positive trend in the economic sector of the state, the Chief Minister said Baba Ramdev is going to invest in a big way to set up his successful business module in the state and a major player like Dabur has also decided to establish a manufacturing plant for their different products in the state.

""Automobile major Mahindra & Mahindra has also expressed interest in setting up a vehicle manufacturing plant in the state which can give a huge fillip to the employment scenario of the state,"" the statement said.

Sonowal said the tea sector was a prime example of how business houses could make profit and contribute to the state's economy by being steadfast in supposedly adverse socio-political environment."

Advertising watchdog ASCI has pulled up several companies, including Bharti Airtel, Tata Teleservices, Mahindra & Mahindra and Himalaya, for misleading advertisements in June.

During the month, the Customer Complaints Council (CCC) of Advertising Standard Council of India (ASCI) upheld complaints against 134 misleading advertisements out of 183, which also included those of Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare, Gillette and Hindustan Unilever.

Out of 134 complaints those were upheld, 44 each belonged to the healthcare and education category, followed by 24 in the food and beverages category and 8 in personal care.

The ad regulator has found that claims of leading telecom services provider Bharti Airtel as the 'best network' as ""incorrect and is misleading by implication"" as it connotes many parameters associated with the performance for which different service providers have to compared.

""'Transparency' of communication providing input for improvement does not necessarily make any network the best,"" said ASCI in its order.

Commenting on the order, an Airtel spokesperson said it is ""the first operator to have made public its entire network information in a transparent fashion and we strongly believe that only when we open ourselves to customer scrutiny will we become the best."" He further said: ""We do not agree with the observation made by ASCI and have shared all details with them."" The regulator also upheld an ad by Tata Teleservices for its Docomo service as ""misleading"", where it had claimed to charge Local/STD Mobile calls at 30p/min in Rs 68.

""The ad claims Rs 68 - Local/STD Mobile calls at 30p/min, is not substantiated and is misleading by ambiguity about the conditions under which this claim is tenable or exclusion criteria for which this offer is not available,"" it said.

ASCI also upheld complaint against Mahindra & Mahindra for misleading the consumer by claiming to offer Mahindra Supro Maxi Truck and Mahindra Maxximo Plus at a discounted price in exchange of their competitor's vehicle Tata ACE.

""The comparisons made in the advertisement were not factual and were not substantiated and are misleading. Also, the comparisons made were likely to mislead the consumers about the product advertised and with which it is compared,"" it added.

Commenting on it, a M&M Spokesperson said: ""This complaint was received from ASCI on June and we have sent the response to ASCI. The ad was released by our local empanelled agency, we had instructed them to discontinue the press ad with immediate effect."" Himalaya Company failed to substantiate the claim made for its facewash, where the FMCG firm claimed the product has the goodness of neem and haldi that gives protection against every skin problems.

According to ASCI, Himalaya could not substantiate it with product efficacy data and the claim was misleading by exaggeration."

Ahead of this week's BRICS summit in Goa, Chinese official media today called on member countries to agree on Beijing's proposal to make the bloc a free trade area and initiate measures to liberalise trade. ""Observers have focused their eyes on New Delhi and have one question in mind: How much courage will it take for the trade ministers from BRICS countries gathering there on Thursday for the summit meeting to promote greater cooperation?"" an article in the state-run Global Times said. ""It seems China is willing to open up its domestic markets to the other four member countries, but they haven't yet made quite the same commitment,"" it said. China recently mooted the idea of setting up a free trade area among Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa (BRICS) countries, it said quoting a recent Chinese Ministry of Commerce statement. The Ministry said a free trade area would be ""a significant form of cooperation."" Beijing has shown sincerity in removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to goods produced in other BRICS countries - the question remaining is whether those nations will match the goodwill of China, the article said. While media reports said BRICS trade ministers will sign an agreement for better economic cooperation with an eye to promoting trade facilitation and reducing non-tariff barriers some BRICS members are not in a hurry to consider a free trade area, it said. ""These countries may be overly cautious about trade liberalisation, and multinational firms will be the victims of such conservative ideas,"" it said. ""China is speeding up its effort to foster a high -standard global free trade network, and has signed 14 free trade agreements with countries and regions including Australia and South Korea. Hopefully, the other BRICS countries will not fall too far behind in terms of sharing the fast-growing domestic market in the world's second-largest economy,"" it said. Total retail sales of consumer goods in China rose by 10.6 percent year-on-year in August, underlining the rapid expansion of China's domestic consumer market, it said, adding that China's electric vehicle market is ""so hot that India's biggest SUV maker (Mahindra and Mahindra) is angling for a piece of the action to exploit the world's biggest auto market,"" it said. BRICS countries account for 40 percent of the world's population. Closer market integration among the nations will definitely help tap the potential for all BRICS members to grow their economies, it said."

He further added: ""I am confident that this new model will be a game changer not only in the electric vehicles segment but also among all other categories of cars."" The company already sells e2O electric vehicle in the country. Yesterday, the company launched eSupro, the electric version of Supro van in two variants - cargo and passenger - strengthening its portfolio of zero emission vehicles.

Earlier this year, Mahindra had also launched an electric version of its Verito sedan, 'eVerito', priced between Rs 9.5 lakh and 10 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).

M&M has rebranded its electric mobility portfolio as Mahindra Electric aiming for a greater focus on technology and launch more electric models, besides supplying powertrains to other manufacturers.

Bringing more electric vehicles is a part of the company's overall global product strategy."

Moody's expects passenger vehicle (PV) sales in India to grow 8 percent this year on account of new model launches, lower fuel costs and ease in financing, although it revised the outlook for global auto industry to negative.

The credit rating agency said it is changing the outlook for the global automotive manufacturing industry to negative from stable on account of weakening global demand.

""In India, we expect (sales) volumes to grow at around 8 percent in 2016, to just under 3.4 million, and to continue this healthy growth trajectory with unit shipments climbing 6 percent in 2017,"" it said in a statement.

New model launches by domestic and foreign manufacturers, lower fuel costs and ease in financing will support this volume growth, it added.

""Performance for India's Tata Motors (Ba1 stable) and Mahindra & Mahindra (Baa3 stable) should largely mirror this positive sentiment,"" it said.

Moody's Investors Service said, on the other hand, the global outlook reflects expectations for fundamental business conditions over the next 12-18 months.

""We lowered our outlook on the industry to negative to reflect the challenges automakers around the world will face as a result of softening demand following an extended period of growth in key markets,"" Moody's Senior Vice President Bruce Clark said.

And while profitability in the sector was previously supported by robust growth and strong margins in US and Chinese markets, today's revised outlook underscores the plateauing demand in the US, coupled with meaningfully diminishing demand in China, he added.

Moreover, sales in Europe are forecast to contract modestly in 2017 while Japan will see sales growth of less than 1 percent in the timeframe, credit rating agency said.

""Auto sales in China will grow 2.7 percent in 2017 as compared to 6.7 percent growth this year. If a tax cut on passenger vehicles with engines of 1.6 liters or smaller is extended by the Chinese government beyond year-end, it could positively affect sales growth in 2017,"" it added."

Cab aggregator Ola today partnered with the Mahindra group that will help foster entrepreneurship among drivers as well as boost the latter's earnings by around Rs 2,600 crore over the next two years.

While Mahindra follows its rival Tata Motors which has joined hands with Uber, for Ola this is the second such alliance having been tied up with Nissan India to buy and lend cars to its drivers.

These alliances come on the heels of a string of tie-ups between online taxi services and automakers both globally as well as here, to cash in on the rising demand and popularity of these services.

The domestic taxi market is worth nearly around Rs 80,000 crore or around USD 12 billion.

Under the alliance, M&M and its group companies in the financial insurance and its used car/bike arm Mahindra First Choice, will sell products (its sole car brand Verito to begin with) and services to Ola.

With this, it will earn an additional Rs 2,600 crore over the next two years when it hopes to sell around 40,000 units, Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra told reporters here announcing the tie-up.

If the alliance works out as planned, it will give be a big boost to Mahindra, as it has been struggling with its only car model Verito, managing to sell around 200 units a month.

The Verito has originally come from its erstwhile French partner Renault.

Asked whether the tie-up is only for Verito, the company officials did not offer a clear answer.

Mahindra said the company has set a target of selling 20,000 units this year through this alliance and double it over the next two years.

Ola, on the other hand will get access to a one-stop-shop for vehicles and services for its drivers under which the company hopes to foster entrepreneurship.

The alliance will provide 100 percent financing to buy Mahindra cars or used card through its platform Mahindra First Choice, apart from providing parts and after sales at discounts.

Earlier this year, Mahindra had expressed concern over the growth of ride-sharing and cab aggregators, terming them as disruptors detrimental to automakers as this will lead to lower car/vehicle ownerships."

Home-grown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra plans to enter new segments of commercial vehicles as it aims to be a full-range player in the said category in the next three years.

Besides, the company is drawing up plans to consolidate its presence in verticals where it is already present.

Mahindra Truck and Bus Division (MTBD), part of the USD 16.9-billion Mahindra Group, has also set an ambitious target of doubling its market share to 8 per cent in the medium and heavy commercial vehicles segment in the next two years while it gears up to export heavy trucks to Africa in the next 2-3 years.

""We are determined to be a full-range player in the commercial vehicle segment. We are already there in the medium and heavy truck segment. We are also developing products for the 8-16 tonnes category. Besides, there is a plan to upgrade the current range of light commercial vehicles,"" MTBD Managing Director Nalin Mehta told PTI.

So, the idea ""is to have a presence in the entire commercial vehicle segment ranging from 3.5-tonne to over 40-tonne category products"".

The company is in the process of investing around Rs 700 crore as part of the product development project that began in 2014.

Under the plan, the company will introduce intermediate commercial vehicles (ICVs), medium commercial vehicles (MCVs), upgrade light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and also consolidate its heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs) segment.

MTBD also expects its market share to improve over the next few years riding on various factors, including expansion of sales network and new product launches.

""We currently have 4 per cent market share in heavy duty trucks. But as we are witnessing growth month over month, we expect to double this market share in the next two years,"" Mehta said.

In the 3.5-7.5 tonne segment, the company has a market share of 12 per cent which it expects to go up as it is upgrading the product portfolio.

""Besides, we are in the process of developing products in the 8-16 tonne category which we expect to launch in the next three years,"" Mehta said.

Asked about exports, he said the company is shipping out 300-odd trucks. ""We are trying to get into Africa as the market there has good potential. It should happen in the next three years,"" Mehta said.

On the CV industry, he said the vertical has grown in the past one year and it is just in the last two months that some slowdown has happened.

""Normally, the buying activity is not that strong during these months. Post-monsoon, we expect the demand to get better again,"" Mehta said."

Mahindra & Mahindra is recalling in India an unspecified number of its SUV Rexton manufactured on or before September 2014 to rectify faulty rear driveshaft.

The recall of the Rexton SUV from the stable of M&M's South Korean arm is being done to check possibility of any loss of torque in the rear driveshaft.

The inspection and subsequent rectification will be carried out free of cost for all Rexton customers, who will be individually contacted by the company, M&M said in a BSE filing.

Calling it a ""proactive inspection"", the company said the exercise is being carried out to ensure a hassle-free experience for its customers.

""This action is also in compliance with SIAM's voluntary code on vehicle recall,"" M&M added.

The Rexton is priced between Rs 21.06 lakh and Rs 24.86 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).

Over two million vehicles have been recalled by various automakers in India ever since the auto industry body SIAM started voluntary vehicle recalls for safety related issues in July 2012."

Axis Direct's research report on M&M



M&M's (+MVML^) Q1 EBITDA was in line with est, driven by strong margin performance offsetting weak revenue growth. M&M has increased its FY17 tractor growth guidance to 13%-16% (vs.10% earlier) on above normal monsoon and higher sowing. In UVs, M&M has filled all product gaps last year and it will build on these launches.

After two bad monsoons, a good one this year can aid a sharp recovery in rural demand. In our view, M&M’s new compact UVsare not its best attempt, but outlook for its rural-facing businesses (tractors & majority of its UVs) could turn favorable. Our earningsestimate islargely unchanged, however we downgrade the stock to HOLD with SoTP-based TP of Rs 1,482on limited upside.

Karvy's research report on M&M



M&M’s Q1FY17 performance was broadly in line with our estimates, helped by softer commodity prices and cost control, despite challenging environment. Company’s volume increased 14% YoY and 6.7% QoQ due to auto volume growth of 11% and tractor growth of 20% YoY. Its (M&M+MVML) Revenues/EBIDTA/PAT increased 11%/11%/5% YoY but declined 4%/17%/32% QoQ in Q1FY17. EBIDTA margins declined 9 bps YoY (up 165 bps QoQ) to 14.1%, as against our estimate of 13.3%. Company‘s EBIDTA margin was healthy, despite challenging business environment and discontinuation of excise benefit from Haridwar plant in Q1FY17. Its EBIT margin was down by 240 bps YoY to 7.8% in auto segment, but rose 120 bps YoY to 18.8% in FES segment in Q1FY17.

Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions. We broadly maintain our volume estimates, while reduce our revenue estimate factoring revised ASP. However, with increasing high tractor contribution, we increase our margin estimates, which results in marginal (~1%) change in our EBIDTA and EPS estimates for FY17E/FY18E. We maintain our SOTP based target price of Rs 1,550 per share, valuing its M&M+MVML at 8x FY18E EBIDTA to Rs 1085 and we value subsidiary at Rs.465, post-20% discount to M-cap. On account of valuation and limited upside, we reiterate our “HOLD” on M&M. Benefit of healthy tractor volume would get nullified by intensifying competition in Automobile segment. We do not see further rerating/upgrade in earnings for M&M and we believe that majority of the positives is priced in, leaving limited upside from CMP.

Homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra's investment in technology and product development has risen over 16-fold in ten years to touch Rs 1,938 crore in 2015-16.

The company, which is betting big on innovation and aims to be among the top 50 'Most Admired' brands in the world by 2021, also filed 173 patents in 2015-16.

""Our investment in technology and product development has grown from Rs 115 crore in FY 2005-06 to Rs 1,938 crore in FY 2015-16,"" Mahindra & Mahindra said in its annual report for 2015-16.

It further said: ""Going forward, we will continue to enhance our technology and product development capability by leveraging the neural network with MRV (Mahindra Research Valley) in Chennai and our partners across the globe."" The MRV facility has been the birthplace of automotive products like XUV500, TUV300, KUV100 and the new-age tractors Arjun NOVO and Mahindra YUVO.

Buying stocks that can rise multifold in a short period is every investor's dream. But it is not easy to identify and buy such stocks at right time and exit at right time. Timing is the most crucial element in investing or trading. This timing can be known through financial astrology. Astrology is the only science which can predict future correctly & guide us about sectors which have to outperform.

Every year with commencement of new Samvat (Hindu New Year), astrologically, based on planetary position, certain new sectors start getting strong astrological support & start outperforming, while some others sectors which were performing earlier start underperforming. Some sectors/stocks remain laggards.

During last Samavat 2072 among other sectors – sugar & paper sectors received strong astrological support & outperformed. Many stocks from sugar sector appreciated by 600-900 percent. It should be recalled that sugar sector, despite strong, remained laggard for many years and started performing only after astrological support came.

Sectors which get very strong astrological support are not normally affected by downfall in the market.

The monsoon plays an important part in MM’s fortunes, as the rural market contributes ~56% to revenue, 72% to standalone PAT and ~64% to SOTP value. After a four-year gap, we expect both the businesses – Tractors and UVs – to deliver ~14.5% volume CAGR over FY16- 18 (v/s flat volumes over FY14-16). This would be supplemented with recovery in key subsidiaries like MMFS, TECHM and Ssangyong.

Betting big on strong earnings cycle ahead the brokerage firm is confident that monsoon and recent launches will drive its growth. It says that that the worst is over for M&M not only in its core businesses of tractors and utility vehicles (UVs) but also in key subsidiaries. The brokerage firm hopes that after a four-year gap both the businesses tractors and UVs will deliver 14.5 percent volume CAGR over FY16-18. With rural India contributing 72 percent to standalone net profit, M&M would be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a normal monsoon, Motilal Oswal adds. It expects 34 percent CAGR in consolidated earnings per share (EPS) over FY16-18 and margins are likely to be 100 basis points improvement by FY18. Despite headwinds, EBITDA margin is likely to expand 80 bps over FY16-18 to 12.9 percent translating into 21 percent EBITDA CAGR over FY16-18. According to the Motilal Oswal M&M has several levers mix, lower Mahindra Trucks and Buses (MTBL) losses, lower marketing spend, operating leverage may offset the impact of exhaustion of the Haridwar plant incentive and commodity price inflation. It expects M&M tractor volumes to recover sharply, with 18.4 percebt CAGR over FY16-18, driven by normal monsoon and low base. ""The government's target to double farm income in five years will not only help in reducing volatility in tractors, but also act as a catalyst to drive penetration of implements,"" says Motilal Oswal in a report. Its total tractor sales increased 20.33 percent to30,191 units in June. Domestic tractor sales grew by 20.49 percent to 28,797 units in June as against 23,899 units in the year-ago month. Exports during the month increased by 17 percent to 1,394 units compared with 1,191 units in the same month a year ago, it added.Meanwhile, Motilal also says M&M may also reduce prices for Scorpio and XUV5OO by 13.5 percent by launching mild hybrids, which enjoy concessional excise duty. With 57 percent market share in LCVs below 3.5 ton, MM’s pick-up volumes are likely to grow at a CAGR of 15 percent over FY16-18, driven by economic recovery, it says.

M&M's total sale increased 8 percent rise in total sales to 39,011 units in June. In the domestic market, sales were up 5 percent at 34,991 units last month compared with 33,282 units in June 2015.

Nomura has maintained its preference for four-wheelers to 2-wheelers after June auto sales data announced last week. It has retained Maruti Suzuki as its preferred pick in the sector.

The brokeage house says medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV) segment industry growth disappointed significantly at flat YoY compared to estimate of around 27 percent. Key disappointment was in Tata Motors with 11 percent YoY decline (first time in past two years).Ashok Leyland also disappointed with 8 percent YoY growth.

Nomura believes there can be downside risk to implied growth of around 28 percent (around 12,500 units per month) for Ashok Leyland over the rest of 9MFY17.

It has maintained thesis that Ashok Leyland enjoys peak margin, market share and valuations, hence scope for disappointment is low. Thus, it has a neutral rating on the stock, despite factoring in 25 percent MHCV growth in FY17.

Two-wheeler (2W) industry volumes were in line with around 12 percent YoY (based on reported numbers). Passenger vehicle (PV) industry volumes were largely in line with around 1.6 percent YoY growth against flat expectations YoY.

Maruti Suzuki's domestic volumes at 92,100 were down around 10 percent YoY, below the estimate of 97,000. Overall volumes were down around 14 percent YoY due to production losses because of plant shutdown and fire at supplier’s plant.Maruti expects to make up for the loss by higher production during rest of the year.

Mahindra and Mahindra's automotive volume growth of around 8 percent disappointed largely led by utility vehicles (UVs). UVs reported only 9 percent YoY growth against the estimate of 18 percent.

M&M's light commercial vehicle (LCV) growth of 2 percent was in line. ""Volume recovery remains critical to achieve our implied growth of 18 percent YoY for the remaining 9MFY17,"" says the brokerage.Tractor volumes were ahead of estimates with around 20 percent YoY for Mahindra and Mahindra and 11 percent growth for Escorts.

For FY17, Nomura expects industry volumes to recover with 12/10 percent growth for PVs/2Ws. For MHCVs, it says it expects 25 percent growth, where there can be downside risk if current momentum is sustained. In tractors, it sees upside risk to 12 percent industry growth for FY17, given the strong demand environment.

Among the unlisted original equipment manufacturers, only Honda reported sharp 38 percent decline. Others like Hyundai were up around 10 percent while Toyota was up 30 percent (due to Innova Crysta ramp up). Ford/Renault also reported strong 109 percent/173 percent growth.Posted by Sunil Shankar Matkar"

Auto major Mahindra & Mahindra today reported an 8 percent rise in total sales to 39,011 units in June. The company had sold 36,134 units in the same month last year.

In the domestic market, sales were up 5 percent at 34,991 units last month compared with 33,282 units in June 2015, M&M said in a statement.

Exports surged 41 percent to 4,020 units during the month as against 2,852 in June last year, it added.

Sales of passenger vehicles, including Scorpio, XUV500, Xylo, Bolero and Verito, also went up 7 percent to 17,070 units, from 15,880 units in the same month last year.

Commercial vehicle sales rose 6 percent to 13,540 units in June as against 12,737 units in the year-ago period, M&M said.

M&M Chief Executive (auto division) Pravin Shah said: “With the advent of a good monsoon which we are currently witnessing, we hope to see improved sentiment and a buoyancy in demand, enhancing rural prosperity.”

On the diesel ban issue, he said: “We do hope that the Supreme Court while taking a decision on the diesel vehicles ban in the NCR region will take cognisance of all facts, including the role the automotive industry plays in the country’s industrial growth.”Mahindra and Mahindra reported a 20.33 percent increase in total tractor sales at 30,191 units in June.

The company had sold 25,090 units in the same month last year.

Domestic tractor sales grew by 20.49 percent to 28,797 units in June as against 23,899 units in the year-ago month, the company said in a statement.

Moneycontrol BureauGoogle search trends offer fascinating insights into which car and bike models are popular, finds a CLSA report. The brokerage house compared the ratio of Google search interest for key car models to their relative sales volume, concluding that there is a strong connect between the two of them.For example, Maruti’s new launches like Baleno and Vitara Brezza continue to sell based on the number of searches run for these two car models. ""The search interest in Baleno has settled at a similar level to that in Hyundai’s i20, which corroborates with the fact the Baleno is now selling similar volumes (about 10K units/month) as the i20 model.""Similarly, the interest level for Maruti's Vitara Brezza is about twice that of Hyundai's Creta. The house estimates Maruti will sell about 8,000 units of Vitara a month and is likely to see higher demand based on search trends.Vitara currently sells 7,500 units a month, which is similar to Creta, but has a 6-month waiting period. Maruti, on the other hand, is planning to raise capacity to 10,000 units per month.However, interest in M&M’s news sport utility vehicles (SUVs) like KUV100 seems to be fading. Tata Motor’s new launch Tiago is garnering interest, but sustainability will be key in coming months. M&M doesn’t seem to be way behind Maruti in garnering interest. Search interest in both its SUVs - KUV100 and TUV300 - seems to be on a downward trend, which pose a potential to demand. “The search interest in TUV3OO, after the initial spike at the time of launch, has now come down to 0.5 times compared with that of Hyundai’s Creta. TUV sales volumes have come down to 2,000 per month in recent months vs 7,500 per month for Creta.”Reducing interest for KUV is a concern for the company, says the brokerage report. KUV, which used to sell 5,000 units per month, has been on a decline. Other vehicles like Renault’s Kwid and Bajaj’s Avenger has seen constant interest. “Search interest in Renault’s new small car Kwid is 60 percent of Maruti’s Alto. If relative volumes also settle around this level, Kwid volumes could rise further to 12,000-13,000 per month vs 10,000 month in recent months,” says the report.In motorcycle segment, Royal Enfield continues to grab eyeballs."

Surendra Goyal of Citi says he expects some surprises in earnings as companies started reporting Q1FY17, based on Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), although it is too early to figure out the quantum.He feels some companies that may see negative Q1FY17 earnings are Zee Entertainment due to interest on redeemable preference shares, and Tech Mahindra, Eicher Motors & Info Edge due to ESOP (employee stock option) cost.

According to him, PSU earnings may benefit on reported employee costs & some corporates like Maruti Suzuki & Hero MotoCorp may gain due to higher interest income.

He remains constructive as better-than-expected Q4FY16 earnings (ex-financials) raises confidence in bottom-up forecast of 14 percent earnings growth in FY17.

The Cabinet has approved recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission benefitting over one crore government employees and pensioners. According to government officials, the cabinet has approved minimum pay hike of 20 percent and maximum pay hike of 25 percent.

Auto companies Maruti, M&M, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotorCorp are likely to benefit most with increase in government employee salaries in 7th pay commission. Historical analysis suggests that arrears and pay hikes lead to immediate spike in auto sales. After 6th pay commission, passenger vehicle sales rose by 19.5 percent to 2.22 million units in FY09 sales rose 19.5 percent in FY09 and 21.2 percent in FY10. Post 6th Pay Commission hike sales of two-wheelers rose by 16 percent in FY09 and 31 percent in FY10.

In an earlier note, Credit Suisse said that the 7th Pay Commission may translate into extra 10 percent growth for the industry. Analysts feel the new pay hike for government pay hike may boost consumption, reduce slackness in the economy and step up investment demand.

Banks too are likely to see strong credit growth especially for retail followed by corporate.

Consumer discretionary companies such as Bata India, Asian Paints, Voltas, Blue Star and Kajaria Ceramics are likely to see good growth. Also other sectors like FMCG and realty are expected to benefit from it.

The pay panel, in November last year, had recommended a 14.27 percent hike in basic pay at junior levels the lowest in 70 years. The previous 6th Pay Commission had recommended a 20 percent hike, which the government doubled while implementing it in 2008. The entry-level pay has been recommended to be raised to Rs 18,000 per month, from the current Rs 7000, while the maximum pay, drawn by the Cabinet Secretary, has been fixed at Rs 2.5 lakh per month from the current Rs 90000.Posted by Nasrin SultanaFollow @NasrinzStory"

While Indian market continues to be volatile, analyts feel direct economic impact of Brexit on broad emerging market is likely to be limited. On Friday, in a surprise move UK voted to leave the European Union sending world markets including India into a tailspin.

Although many feel that Brexit may drag UK into a recessionary phase, few are optimistic that next catalyst for the market would be political developments in Europe as well as central bank activity globally. On Friday, the day of Brexit referendum results, the benchmark Sensex lost nearly 1,100 points intra-day before closing 604.51 points lower. Investors' wealth in stock market took a hit of nearly Rs 1.8 lakh crore on that day.

Deutsche Bank: Sun Pharma, Lupin, Aurobindo, ITC, Titan, NTPC, M&M, Hero Motocorp, Shriram Transport, BPCL, HPCL and Ultratech appear most insulated in the current environment. Correspondingly metals and IT services would be less preferred, it warns. Large cap picks are Hero Motocorp, M&M, Titan, Zee, ITC, BPCL, HPCL, HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finserv, Sun Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma, NTPC & BHEL. Top mid cap picks are Cummins India, SKF India, Shriram Transport Finance & Whirlpool India. Credit Suisse: It advises investors to stay overweight domestic focused defensive sectors: consumer staples, discretionary, utilities, and OMCs (ICICI, L&T, BPCL, HUL, HDFC, Shriram Transport Finance). A global low interest rate environment should also support NBFCs.

CLSA says Tata Motors continued to be its top pick in Indian autos followed by Maruti Suzuki that has an outperform rating, especially after recent month sales data. The brokerage is also positive on Mahindra & Mahindra and Bajaj Auto, which both also have outperform rating while it is negative on Eicher Motors, Hero MotoCorp and TVS Motor Company.

After a long downturn, CLSA expects India's auto demand to gradually recover over the next two years. In FY17, it expects passenger vehicle (PV) industry sales to grow 9 percent YoY, 2-wheelers (2Ws) to grow 11 percent and medium & heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs) to grow 25 percent.

In May, India's PV volumes grew 6 percent YoY, 2Ws rose 10 percent while trucks grew 27 percent YoY.

PV as well as 2W sales growth rates have softened sequentially after a sharp improvement in April but still looked decent, says the brokerage, adding there was strong growth in small utility vehicles (SUVs) and commercial vehicles sales.

In case of 2Ws, this was largely expected as a concentrated wedding season in March-April this year had boosted growth in earlier months, says the brokerage. In PVs, Maruti gained 2.5 percentage point (ppt) share QoQ led by the success of its new models (Vitara Brezza & Baleno), while M&M lost 1ppt QoQ. In 2Ws, Hero lost 2ppt QoQ share, while Bajaj and Honda gained 1ppt each.

Meanwhile, truck demand remained strong with M&HCV sales rising 27 percent YoY in May.

CLSA says Tata Motors and Eicher Motors have gained 2ppt QoQ share each in Q1 while Ashok Leyland has lost 4ppt share.

Light commercial vehicle sales grew 14 percent YoY in May and are seeing signs of a recovery on a low base. M&M has gained 1ppt share QoQ, primarily from Tata Motors, says the brokerage.Posted by Sunil Shankar Matkar"

He continues to be underweight on two-wheelers as the industry structure remains unattractive, the incumbents' product portfolio is not geared to growing parts of the industry and a low operating leverage business model is implying no material impact of volumes uptick on earnings.

He has a buy rating on Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra. Chhaochharia says his preferred picks on the monsoon theme would be Coromandel International and Emami."

SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com in an interview to CNBC-TV18 spoke on the sales number by auto companies. He said the sales numbers by Ashok Leyland were disappointing, while he sees more upside for SML Isuzu.

He also shared his views on Amtek Auto, Asian Paints, Adani Ports, the cement stocks and tractor manufacturers.

Below is the verbatim transcript of SP Tulsian's interview with Anuj Singhal and Sonia Shenoy on CNBC-TV18. Anuj: First a word on Ashok Leyland and the fact that it’s down 5 percent today, of course, a remarkably strong stock, but your first thoughts on the monthly sales number and the market’s reaction? A: If you see the company has posted the average monthly sales, I am referring the last quarter that is first quarter of 2016 or fourth quarter of FY16 they have posted a monthly sales average of about 14,000 vehicles per month. We have seen the disappointment in the month of April where the sales were at about 11,000, but this time sales having come below 10,000 is definitely a cause of concern because company has been on an upward trajectory and people have taken that 12,000-13,000 run rate of monthly sales is going to maintain by the company and that will give them a very big operating leverage, because of the high fixed cost and all sort of things, but yes monthly sales now slipping below 10,000 will be seen a disappointment, because this has happened continuously for two months for month of April it fell by about 3,000 vehicles on an average and now down by further 1,000 will be seen quite disappointment.

Sonia: Your other favourite SML Isuzu has done very well this month yet again. It is in the same space, ballpark, and the numbers are looking quite good. Would you buy this stock at this price or do you think it has run up a lot? A: These are excellent numbers are if you see these are the highest monthly sales posted by SML Isuzu and I wish to draw we discussed this in the morning when I said that I am expecting the sales numbers of SML Isuzu to come very good. If you see 1,400 were the numbers for the month of April and in fact sometimes when you analyse the numbers of SML Isuzu with Force Motors you feel that probably the share of Force Motors is eaten away by SML Isuzu and 1,900 vehicle sales in the month of May makes a total sales of above 3,300. Now if you see for March quarter they had a sales of about 3,500 vehicles for three months and already in two months they have achieved a sales of about 3,350. If I go by year-on-year (Y-o-Y) also always Q1 is the best number for the company on the monthly sales as well as on the financial performance. If I am again expecting similar kind of run I am not expecting 1,900 vehicles for month of June but definitely it is likely to be anywhere between 1,300 to 1,500. So, if you get to see the sales figure of about 4,800 the Q1 earnings per share (EPS) of the company will be seen at Rs 25 plus and that will be received very well by the market because people will now start taking a call on the profitability of the company from here on and that will be seen very positive with EPS of Rs 25.

So, I am expecting that probably we have a very good upside from here on because now the monthly sales number of June and then thereafter a call on Q1 numbers which as I said are going to be an excellent numbers with EPS expected to be of about Rs 24-25 for Q1.

Sonia: You heard what the Amtek Auto management had to say. Between last quarter and now there has been no progress on the deal closure although they are promising that things will take place within the next four to six weeks. You had recommended the stock a while back. Would you still keep the faith here? A: You are right and actually I recommended the stock and post that the stock has risen by about 50 percent and way above my target given about six months back. But If you really take a call on the management they are just repeating the same thing, debt of Rs 15,000 crore, monetisation of Tekfor, identifying the promoter, identifying the buyer, monetising the other assets also in India and abroad, expected to realise about Rs 7,000 crore. Earlier they were talking about Rs 10,000 but in today's commentary they said about two third of the debt will get reduced in next two to three years. That means they are talking of the debt coming down to Rs 4,000 crore but market has stopped believing the management and unless and until we see some concrete steps because if you recall alone Tekfor can see the debt reducing by about Rs 4,000-5,000 crore for the group because this Rs 14,800 crore debt stated by the management is a consolidated debt and in fact three or four companies all are victim of that.

Whether you include Castex Technology, Metalyst Forging, Amtek Auto or JMT Auto. JMT Auto is not as vulnerable as the other three companies are. So, yes, if these things will happen market will definitely be taking that with both the hands because it is a very good auto ancillary company though again management has posted cautious view on India but these companies, the Amtek Group has a very strong presence abroad. Maybe like you can call it as a mini Motherson Sumi kind of things but the debt burden, the results which we have seen of all these four companies for this March quarter was really horrible, the kind of exceptional and all that. So, yes, quick actions has to be taken and I wish that management stick to their commitment because management stick to their commitment because last time also four to six months back they were very categorical in saying that the debt monetisation will happen in next three to four months but nothing has happened and I recall at that time they had given an indication of Rs 7,000-8,000 crore mobilisation in next one year. We have already seen 6-7 months having elapsed. So, let us hope that this time deal happens in next 6-8 weeks and they are able to mobilise about Rs 4,000-5,000 crore and if that happens there will be a vast rerating of the stock because the company is backed by the asset. It is not like a case of JP Associate Group where the deterioration or asset valuations have fallen. They can recover this money, they have huge investments in India also. So, let us hope the management sticks to their plan of mobilising at least Rs 4,000-5,000 crore in next six to eight weeks for Tekfor. Anuj: The other stock that we have to discuss now is Asian Paints. Of course we discussed it a week back and from that point actually got even more expensive. Do you get a sense that it is time to just retreat from here and wait for correction before making fresh entry? A: That is right and in fact couple of days back only I have said that Rs 1,000 looks the March more valuations and you can call it as fully priced because probably now the momentum or the trading grip that is making the stocks to move up. Once you see the Q1 numbers definitely going to be disappointing I don't think that the same kind of growth can be maintained by the company. Yes, Q2 and Q3 will be a different story but market will not wait for four or five months to see that Q2 numbers. So, the stock has to take some profit booking and may have to correct to a level of Rs 970-975 and I won't be surprised to see that happening in this June series only. I am not saying that this stock will collapse, maybe everyday this stock is forming the higher bottom but the next support maybe seen at Rs 970-975 once that correction even takes place which is expected in this series and on a fundamental basis I won't give a buy call on this stock now. Anuj: A word on Adani Ports. That has been a phenomenal stock. I remember it used to be one of your big calls. You were bullish on Adani Ports. At Rs 202 how is the stock stacked up? A: That is right. In fact maybe when the stock was ruling at around Rs 230-240 and then when it went up to level of Rs 290-300 and during that time the buy call was given and even at the current rate of maybe once the stock corrected to the level of Rs 225 we again started giving a buy call and we continue to have a positive view because if you go by the financial performance and the growth trajectory which the company is posting expanding on both east and west coast those are since quite good but actually it is very unfortunate that in this last four or five months since its inclusion in the Nifty and Sensex this stock has been correcting since then.

Generally it is always the other way. When the stock is included in the main indices it always goes up. Then maybe with Q4 numbers once they are declared some kind of inter-corporate or maybe the group transfer of the money was raised as a concern by the market and that has made the stock to correct. But yes, at the current stage if someone has the courage to buy the stock with one year view I won't be surprised to see with a gain of about Rs 30-35 percent from the current levels. That means a target of about Rs 270-275.

Anuj: Any call on cement? Of course, you have had your favourites in the past but, ACC and Ambuja at current prices. Would you buy them? A: Ambuja, in fact has not participated in the cement rally to the extent which was warranted from that company, number one. Number two, ACC I see a lot of efficiency improvement to be seen in the performance of the company, maybe in terms of the margin expansion and all that. So, both the stocks from that point of view looks good because if you take a frontline stock like Shree Cements, UltraTech Cement or maybe Ramco Cements, because they are all 25 million plus category cement companies and Ambuja and ACC also, have the same kind of capacity of 30 million tonnes, So if you place them, probably both of them are looking quite cheap as compared to other three stocks which I mentioned. Sonia: The tractor sales for the month of May have looked very good. Mahindra and Mahindra tractor sales up 20 percent, Escorts tractor sales in double digit growth and we have some of these smaller companies like Swaraj Engines which have in any case been in the news on the upside. What would your pick of the pack be? A: You are right and actually we have discussed again that in the morning that M&M is going to perform or going to post very good numbers on the tractor front and rightly so they have posted a sales of 23,000 vehicles, 23,000 plus and actually I expect the same momentum to continue for June also because April, May and June or maybe May and June are always the best. Even coming on Escorts, the tractor number sales of about 5,000 plus, but if you take a call on the Swaraj Engines, they are reaching to their capacity utilisation to the full level. They are supplying closer to about 70,000 engines, if I am not mistaken. They have not been, because you may take a positive view on a quarterly results, but if you take a Y-o-Y result, I do not think that there is any kind of upside we have seen in the performance of Swaraj Engine. The stock has become quite expensive but yes, amongst the auto space, we have discussed a while back that SML Isuzu probably looks the best and then followed by maybe M&M. Even I will remain away from Escorts also because one has to see the valuation and also on those parameters, it is not seem to be too comforting."

Utility vehicles maker Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) disappointed analysts on automotive sales front but tractors business beat expectations.

M&M has sold 40,656 vehicles in May, which increased by 11 percent compared to 36,706 units sold in same period last year, driven by domestic as well as exports.

Domestic sales grew by 10 percent year-on-year to 36,613 units and exports surged 21 percent to 4,043 units in month gone by. Passenger and commercial vehicle sales increased 8 percent and 48 percent, respectively.

Favourable monsoon projections will definitely lead to improved buyer sentiment that would likely bring buoyancy in overall demand across all segments of the automotive industry, Pravin Shah, president & chief executive (automotive) said, adding the upcoming e Verito launch, on June 2, will add a new and innovative product to EV range.

Motilal Oswal had estimated auto sales growth of 23 percent and tractors at 17 percent while the same were estimated at 15.7 percent and 10 percent by Nomura, respectively.

Tractors sales in May increased 20 percent to 23,018 units YoY, aided entirely by domestic business that grew by 21 percent at 22,148 units. However, exports declined 14 percent to 870 units in same period.

Rajesh Jejurikar, president & chief executive - farm equipment & two wheeler division, said recent launch of new Mahindra YUVO tractor platform has received an excellent response in Indian market.

At 14:57 hours IST, the scrip of Mahindra and Mahindra was quoting at Rs 1,334.00, up Rs 9.30, or 0.70 percent on BSE.Posted by Sunil Shankar Matkar"

M&M is expecting its tractor business to post a good growth but is not looking to launch any new model this fiscal. In an analysts conference call, the company said that tractor volume growth may come in at 10 percent in Q1FY17 though monsoon will play an important factor in deciding agriculture consumption this season.

Holding on to a good monsoon hopes, tractor business has seen a recovery in fourth quarter of FY16 with 10 percent industry growth and M&M expects similar growth to sustain in 1Q FY17. M&M gained market share by 100 basis points in FY16 and it aims to do better than the industry even in FY17 with the recent launch of Yuvo platform. Due to both weak prices (international grain prices down) and weak monsoons affecting sowing, industry growth had slowed down in last two years.

Citi forecasts M&M’s volume growth at 10 percent in FY17 post a two-year year decline as its market share remains strong at 40 percent. It says Mahindra’s new tractor platform Yuvo in which it has invested Rs 300 crore should help to garner more market share, especially in the 30-45hp segment. No new platform launch is seen in FY17 but there could be refreshes/petrol variants of existing models. The brokerage has a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1550 per share but lowered earnings per share (EPS) by 12-13 percent over FY17/18 to reflect impact of reduction in tax benefits.

Deutsche Bank sees tractor growth at 12 percent/8 percent in FY17/18. “On the auto segment, management expects a strong FY17 driven by the ramp-up of SUVs launched in 2HFY16. Management also highlighted that it will launch gasoline variants of the XUV500 and Scorpio models in FY17. We forecast M&M’s SUV volume growth at a 17% CAGR (FY16-18).”Morgan Stanley expects recovery in tractor volumes in F17, driven by above-average monsoon forecasts and think this could be key to a re-rating of the stock. MM does not have any new UV launches planned for F2017 and expects to capitalise on the recent launches –TUV and KUV. It has an overweight rating on the stock. In Q4, M&M's farm equipment revenue increased 8.9 percent YoY to Rs 2,743 crore in Q4. Farm segment's EBIT (earnings before interest & tax) rose 24.7 percent to Rs 353.3 crore but margin contracted by 240 basis points at 12.9 percent compared to year-ago period.Credit Suisse says long-term focus for farm equipment division is to reduce the tractor share from India – increase share of international businesses along with non-tractors (implementers such as harvesters etc). Other agri businesses – both inputs (crop protection) and output (dairy, fruits, oil, etc.) are also potentially very high growth areas, it adds. The brokerage says M&M expects to build on the recent momentum on the UV side driven by gradual economic recovery and full year of new launches done in FY16. It has a neutral rating but increased target to Rs 1390 per share.

At 12:00 hrs, Mahindra and Mahindra was quoting at Rs 1,337.55, up Rs 12.85, or 0.97 percent on the BSE.Follow @NasrinzStory"

Religare's research report on M&M



M&M’s operating performance (M&M+MVML) for Q4FY16 was a tad below expectations, with EBITDA margins coming in at 12.5% (RCMLe 13%; +73bps YoY/-166bps QoQ) as lower tractor margins led to a slight miss on RCMLe. Adj. PAT (MM-MVML) at Rs 6.6bn too came in below RCMLe (Rs 7.2bn) due to higher depreciation. We pare our FY17/FY18 earnings estimates by 10% each to factor in lower margins due to cost pressures and phasing out of Haridwar plant excise benefits. Maintain HOLD with a Mar’17 TP of Rs 1,300.

Mahindra & Mahindra today said it has entered into a brand licence agreement with Pininfarina for use of trademarks after closing the deal to acquire 76.06 per cent stake in the Turin-based company.

Last year Mahindra group had announced to acquire Pininfarina for an overall outgo of over 50 million Euros (nearly Rs 370 crore) after months of negotiations.

The acquisition was carried out through a special purpose vehicle (SPV). Last year the company had said that Tech Mahindra and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) will own 60 per cent and 40 per cent respectively in the automotive and industrial design firm.

""That the transaction has closed, the SPV has acquired 76.06 per cent stake in Pininfarina and as part of the overall transaction, the company has also entered into a brand license agreement with Pininfarina for use of trademarks owned by the Pininfarina group including licensing of brand Pininfarina for automotive products of the company,"" Mahindra & Mahindra said in a regulatory filing.

The Mahindra counter ended 0.6 per cent down at Rs 1,327.50 on the BSE whose benchmark Sensex continued its upward journey for the fifth continuous trading day gaining 0.30 percent."

The last leg of corporate results from blue-chips like Tata Motors and NTPC and the progress of monsoon rains will be key to stock market movement this week, say experts.

Besides, auto stocks will take centre-stage as monthly sales data roll in.

""The last batch of Q4 corporate results, update on movement of monsoon rains and trend in global financial markets will dictate the near-term trend on stock markets. To begin with, global markets on Monday will react to comments from US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen,"" said Vijay Singhania, founder-director, Trade Smart Online, a brokerage house.

Also, this week, on the macroeconomic front, GDP numbers are due to be announced, he added.

""Auto sale numbers for May will be announced this week.

Quarterly results of a few big companies like Tata Motors, Aurobindo Pharma, NTPC and M&M will also be announced this week,"" said Nirdosh Gaur, MD and CEO, Moneypalm, which deals in brokerage activity.

Shares of Coal India and Hindalco may also react on Monday to their results which were announced on Saturday.

Also, purchasing managers' index (PMI) data for services and manufacturing sectors are scheduled for this week, which will have some bearing on trading.

For the week, the Sensex climbed 1,351.70 points, or 5.34 per cent while NSE Nifty surged 406.95 points, or 5.25 per cent. For both the indices, the jump is their biggest weekly gain since March 4."

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) today said it has incorporated its agricultural equipment rental services arm Trringo.com as a wholly-owned subsidiary.

""Trringo.com is incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of M&M with an initial subscription of 50,000 shares of Rs 10 each aggregating Rs 5 lakh,"" the Mumbai-based utility vehicle major said in a regulatory filing.

An organised farm equipment rental service through a franchise-based model using new-age digital technology, Trringo-com was incorporated on May 23.

Its operations will be initially limited to India.

Trringo will use a proprietary digital platform as an enabler to process orders and pass them on to the nearest franchisee through location-based mapping.

Franchisee could also tie up with tractor owners in the vicinity enabling them to rent out equipment to farmers on a commission basis.

Besides, large farmers who own expensive, high-end equipment can rent out their assets, optimising utilisation based on seasonality, cutting across geographies.

The stock was trading at Rs 1,291.30 on BSE, up 0.38 percent from its previous close."

Every year with commencement on new Samvat (Hindu New Year), astrologically, based on planetary position, certain new sectors start getting astrological support & outperform, while others remain laggards.

During last Samavat 2071 among other sectors, food processing & leather sectors received strong astrological support & outperformed.

Always be very cautious, when some main planets i.e. Rahu, Ketu, Jupiter & Lord Saturn are changing their houses. It may be that certain sectors which were continuously getting support for long time may stop receiving support due to change in position by above planets & stocks of those sectors starts coming down, resulting in losses. This is common reason, why most people loss money.

One should trade only in the stocks of that sectors which are getting very strong astrologically support.

Sectors which get very strong astrological support are not normally affected by downfall in the market.

Shares of Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra fell by as much as 4 percent today after their popular passenger vehicle models in India -- Celerio, Eeco and Scorpio -- failed crash test by vehicle safety group Global NCAP with 'zero star' ratings.

The scrip of Maruti fell 3.57 percent to Rs 3,808 on BSE.

Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) too went down 2.17 percent to Rs 1,312.25.

Five popular passenger vehicle models in India -- Maruti's Celerio and Eeco van , Renault Kwid, Mahindra Scorpio and Hyundai Eon -- have failed crash tests by Global NCAP with 'zero star' ratings.

The companies, however, have contested the test results.

The UK-based group tested five models, which included Eeco, sold in India, and found that the vehicles ""showed low levels of adult occupant protection"".

However, Maruti Suzuki insisted that all its products were safe and met ""the safety standards of India and in most cases, exceed them"".

According to Global NCAP, Mahindra Scorpio scored zero star rating in the adult occupant protection and two stars in child occupant protection.

M&M on its part said its entire automotive products are developed and manufactured to meet or exceed the safety standards set in India."

With the Supreme Court set to take up the matter of ban on diesel cars and SUVs on Monday, the world's largest automaker Toyota said continued restrictions on vehicles that comply with all regulations would be the ""worst advertisement of India"".

The ban has been imposed on diesel vehicles with an engine capacity of above 2,000 cc in Delhi and NCR.

The company, which operates in India as a joint venture -- Toyota Kirloskar Motor -- with the Kirloskar group, is among the worst hit and has not been selling its popular vehicles Innova and SUV Fortuner in the Delhi-NCR region since the ban was imposed in December last year.

""If we don't get a breakthrough on Monday, our vehicles despite being compliant of all regulations in India would continue to be banned. That's the worst advertisement of India,"" Toyota Kirloskar Motor Vice-Chairman and Whole-time Director Shekar Viswanathan told PTI.

Stating that the environment lobby is not adequately informed, he said: ""Does the ban suggest to mean that other diesel, petrol and CNG driven vehicles don't pollute? Why is the ban only on 2,000 cc and above diesel cars and SUVs?"" On the company's plans in case the ban stays, Viswanathan said: ""Then, we will sit out of the market where the ban is imposed. We cannot change the engine specification as our customers may not desire it."" He also cautioned that there would be ""losses, laying off of people and hardships for dealerships"" in the auto industry if other cities were to seek a similar ban on such diesel vehicles as is being currently done in the capital and NCR.

Questioning the rationale of the ban, he said: ""While the latest BS-IV compliant cleaner vehicles are banned, old vehicles of pre-BS era, BS I, I and III continue to pollute."" Asked if Toyota is ready for an environment compensation cess on the lines of the Supreme Court asking the Delhi Police to pay 30 per cent of the real value of new vehicles as a pre-condition for their registration, Viswanathan said: ""That would be too much of a burden for ordinary customers."" Besides Toyota, other manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar Land Rover and Mahindra & Mahindra are the major automobile firms hit by the ban.

The automobile industry has been against the ban, saying such restrictions will not help achieve the desired objective of reducing pollution and will only vilify diesel technology.

Maruti Suzuki India Chairman R C Bhargava had termed the ban as ""totally arbitrary""."

Chennai-based TVS Motor Co has topped customer satisfaction with after-sales service for two-wheelers, amid dealers in India facing significant competitive pressure from independent workshops, according to a study by market research and consulting firm JD Power.

The study, which measured customer satisfaction with the after-sales service experience at original equipment (OE) authorised service centre during the first 12-24 months of ownership, found Suzuki Motorcycle India at the second spot followed by Royal Enfield at third.

Two-wheeler market leader Hero MotoCorp was at the sixth spot, while homegrown rival Bajaj Auto was at the seventh place. The fourth and fifth spot were occupied by Japanese majors Yamaha and Honda respectively.

According to the study, at a scale of 1,000 points, TVS scored a total of 773 in the customer satisfaction index, while Suzuki scored 764 and Royal Enfield 758.

Yamaha scored 757 followed by Honda at 750, all above industry average of 748 points.

Hero MotoCorp scored 742 points, Bajaj Auto 738 and Mahindra 738, all below the industry average of customer satisfaction.

JD Power said two-wheeler dealers in India face significant competitive pressure from independent workshops, which are providing similar service work as the OE authorised network.

More than one in five two-wheeler customers indicate visiting an independent workshop during the warranty period, the study said.

""Given the high propensity of customers visiting independent workshops, it is critical for manufacturers and their authorised network to develop a differentiated service experience, thus providing a compelling reason for customers to revisit,"" JD Power Executive Director Mohit Arora said.

Significant opportunities for improvement exist related to key customer expectations of quality, cost and time, he added.

JD Power said its inaugural India two-wheeler customer satisfaction study was based on evaluations from 7,270 two-wheeler owners in 45 cities across India.

These owners purchased a new two-wheeler between November 2013 and March 2015 and had a service experience within three months of evaluation. It included over 75 two-wheeler models from different manufacturers."

""Sustainability is an integral part of Mahindra's approach to business.

Having launched its electric car 'e2o' in the UK, Indian auto major Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is now keen to drive into other advanced European markets including Sweden and Norway as part of its business expansion plans for this new vehicle segment. The company is bullish on advanced countries in terms of electric vehicle markets on account of affordability and other issues. To cash in on opportunities available, e2o was launched just two months after rolling out GenZe electric scooter in California (USA).

""When you look at countries which are going to be early adopters, those are countries which are more advanced because the affordability is the key issue given battery costs are high at this stage. So by definition, electric cars will be more affordable in affluent economies,"" Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra told PTI. ""Secondly, concerns over climate change and the regulation concerning climate change is also much more stringent in the Western countries.

So by that logic, the markets in the West and affluent countries will move faster towards electric vehicle than the Indian market,"" he said. Thus, M&M is looking at northern European markets including the Netherlands for launching its electric vehicle offering. ""Once we see traction here (in the UK) we certainly want to expand the market to other European countries.

Some of the priority markets are the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,"" he said. M&M recently launched 'e2o' in the UK market priced up to 15,995 pounds (over Rs 15 lakh) designed specifically for urban commuting. ""Electric vehicle is exempt from congestion surcharge and road tax that immediately provides a competitive advantage which offsets some of the cost disadvantages in India and that is why the UK was the right place to foray into Europe,"" he said.

The entry-level e2o City is priced at 12,995 pounds, while the higher-spec TechX version would retail at 15,995 pounds and includes a host of features like touchscreen infotainment centre with reversing camera, telematics, leather seats, alloy wheels and a rapid charging port. The interesting part is that the e2o involves a complete online buying bypassing dealership network. At 12,995 ponds, it is competitively priced vis-a-vis models such as the Nissan Leaf.

The new vehicle is an innovative combination of advancements in automotive, electronics and information technology paired with minimal running costs and zero tailpipe emissions, he said. ""This makes it the ideal urban runabout or second car for the two-and-a-half-million UK households that can charge the car at home in a driveway or garage,"" he added."

The market rally, which has been seen in last five to six weeks, needs a bit of consolidation, says Jyotivardhan Jaipuria Founder & MD Veda Investment Managers. Lot of global as well as domestic factors has been responsible for this rally. Jaipuria, who is bullish on domestic money, says that Nifty may touch 9,000 mark before the end of this year. Ashwini Gujral of ashwinigujral.com says that looking at the current momentum, it isn’t far when Nifty re-visits 7,900-8,000 level. The main trigger for this market is the monsoon forecast, Gujral says adding that: “since markets discount the future it will be easier to absorb whatever negative surprises are there.”Among emerging markets (EMs), the best performing market so far has been Brazil on back on low commodity prices. “In this sort of a rally, India actually does not do as well as a lot of other emerging markets do because India is treated like a safe haven,” Jaipuria says. However, even if this rally ends, India is likely to do well among EMs, he adds.With expectations of an above average monsoon, tractors and two-wheelers are likely to do well. “The delta change is probably going to be the biggest in tractors followed by the two-wheelers because the rural story will play out,” Jaipuria says adding that four-wheelers will continue its volume uptrend. Banking sector, which has been reeling under stressed asset situation, will start performing better once commodity prices stabalise. Another positive for banks is more risk-on from foreigners who mostly invest in corporate banks, he says. Cement sector is expected to perform well in longer period based on the recent momentum. However, Jaipuria expects stocks to dip as earnings will not be great.

The most underperforming sector so far has been IT last year. “IT is probably is one of the best performing sector year-to-date,” he says, but adds that likleiness of rural and urban sector performing well will keep IT understated.“IT, pharma and consumer probably will underperform most of these risk-on rallies,” he says adding that that growth in these stable sectors will be in low double-digits.Below is the transcript of Jyotivardhan Jaipuria and Ashwani Gujral's interview with CNBC-TV18's Anuj Singhal and Sonia Shenoy.Sonia: The last time when we spoke with you on this show, things were really different and now look where we are. We have crossed the 25,000 mark on the Sensex again. Do you think that the best is yet to come?Jaipuria: Probably from now, the market needs a bit of consolidation. We have had a very good rally in the market for the last 5-6 weeks. But, one thing which I must caution is, there have been a lot of India specific factors which have turned positive. A lot of this rally is still a very global rally. So, if we see global markets from the G20 Summit in China which was at the end of February, most global markets have had a rally and the turning point there in the globe was really since that day the dollar has started depreciating and which like people say, probably there was a Shanghai accord which helped that fact. But whether there was a Shanghai accord, it was a rally in the dollar which helped commodities go up, which has helped the equity markets go up and that is one overriding factor which probably adds to the positive we have seen on India.Anuj: Sceptics would say that even the Wednesday rally, while it looked good, actually paled in comparison to the big global rally that we had. And in fact, even week to date, even Indian market has underperformed the MSCI emerging market. But, going forward, do you think our market will play more catch up to correct some of the year to date underperformance. We of course underperformed in February, ahead of the Budget fears. That out of the way, do you think some more catching up is required for our markets?Jaipuria: I guess what we have seen and the reason India has been underperforming is we have seen the massive risk on rally. So, if we see the emerging markets, the best performing market is Brazil which is like from year to date, if you take dollar terms, Brazil is up over 30 percent. Since February end, Brazil is up 20 percent in dollar terms. So, Brazil has been one star outperformer because the commodities have done very well and that has been helping Brazil. In this sort of a rally, India actually does not do as well as a lot of other emerging markets do because India is treated like a safe haven. But, I would think over the course of the year, India would still be one of the better performing emerging markets because I do not think this rally is something which will continue and continue for a long time. In fact, my worry is that if this dollar strength now starts to taper off, because it is hurting Japan and it is hurting euro and I do not know what stand they will take. Somewhere the central banks there may have to make some move to try and depreciate their currency and that could see this rally coming a bit into question mark.Sonia: Let us talk about some big sectors which moved this week. One of them was autos. I am going to name a couple of stocks for you and tell me where you see more value. Hero MotoCorp which has hit a new high at Rs 3,150. Tata Motors, which has rallied 15 percent in just one week and then you have some of the smaller companies like TVS Motors that are sitting at new highs as well. Where do you see more potential now?Jaipuria: For me it would be probably, if you look at the next 6-9 months, I would be most bullish on the tractor people followed by the two-wheelers and the four-wheelers. So, that would be my pecking order because if we get a good monsoon, the tractors are the ones which are going to give you the biggest bang for buck because you will have a huge swing coming there. In the four-wheelers we have seen a strong performance over the last 12-18 months in terms of volumes. So, though volumes still continue to be strong, the delta change is probably going to be the biggest in tractors followed by the two-wheelers because the rural story will play out.Anuj: The leader of the current market rally, just this month’s rally has been ICICI Bank. Of course, from oversold ground we have seen a big rally in some of these economy facing banks. ICICI, Axis, even couple of PSU Banks. Do you think some more valuation play is left in some of these banks even if the underlying problems are still intact?Jaipuria: More than valuation, probably what is helping them is again commodities. So, if commodities start to do well, some of the problems which you see in a lot of these banks, whether it is the private sector or the public sector, who have lent to corporates will probably get sorted out. So, we have seen commodity rally globally. We have also seen because of the import price that steel sector in India is starting to do well. So, that is one thing which is helping. The second is also the risk on. As we get risk-on, people are more willing to buy some of these. And some of these large private sector banks are the banks which foreigners buy the most. So, they are some of the most over-owned companies for foreigners, so whenever foreigners start getting more bullish these are the stocks which go up disproportionately, and the converse also happens when we fall, they fall disproportionately also.Sonia: You spoke about the tractor manufacturers and how you are bullish on them, the other pocket that has once again comeback in the limelight is the cement space so names like ACC, Grasim some of them are sitting at new highs. Is there still a lot of potential here or would you be concerned about sub-par earnings keeping the stocks upside capped.Jaipuria: We see cement do well over the two year-three year frame, but we will probably get better chances to buy at the quarterly results are not going to be greats. So, probably some of the stocks will tend to slip, so these are things you would want to buy when the stock prices come down rather than buy it at today’s prices.Anuj: The underperforming sector has been of course in the context has been IT. Ex of Infosys we haven’t too much by way of TCS or couple of other stocks. What do you think is happening here and incrementally would you want to put some more money in IT.Jaipuria: If you just step back actually IT is one of the best performing sector year-to-dates apart from best performing sector year-to-date is the metals, which of course as nobody owned and so it has done very well. So IT is probably is one of the best performing sector year-to-date. It is a play which for people it has become we buy IT when nothing else really looks good. IT and even pharma and consumer probably will underperform most of these risk-on rallies, because it’s become a very stable sector where growth in going to be the low double-digit but it is not a sector which is going to excite either way. You can’t expect a 25 percent earnings growth here. You probably look at between 10-15 percent earnings growth going forward. So it’s underperforming more because everything else is starting to look good so people are willing to take more risk on the gone in names. I would not be very positive on IT for this year, because my view is that we will get like domestic consumption both rural and urban doing well. There will be some pockets where investments will pick-up also, so I would be probably neutral to slightly underweight on IT.Sonia: The top that we hit in January 2015 was 9000 on Nifty now there are some hopes that at least we can make an attempt to get there. Do you get a sense that before the end of the year we could be seeing those levels yet again.Jaipuria: I look at fiscal year, so before the end of this fiscal year, we probably should be hitting those levels or coming close to it.Anuj: What about the domestic sentiment, we have seen the domestic participation in this market has remained intact barring that two or three month period when the market went through that massive correction, the domestic flows have supported the market throughout last year and they continue. We haven’t seen big outflows yet. Do you think they will continue to support the market.Jaipuria: I am quite positive on the domestic money coming into the equity markets because of two things - one is as we get market rallying, the midcaps will do well and that always support domestic inflow. The second is we have to think of the alternate for lot of domestic retail investors so real estate used to be the biggest thing for them followed by gold and both of these asset classes are coming into question marks returns from them are slipping and to that extent equities are starting to look good. As interest rates come down, even people may start thinking as a saver I don’t get too much money if fixed deposit let me move a bit to equities.Anuj: We were talking through the week that the good part about this market was that a lot of people would have managed to buy the dips and they would have been rewarded with the kind of move that we had on Tuesday and Wednesday. However going forward what is your next advice. Do you think this is a market which has given clear indications of seeking much higher levels and may be sticking with long positions would work. Or is there temptation to book some profit may be early next week?Gujral: People who book losses late lose their money before everybody else. People who book profits early are the second ones who lose their money but they lose it over a period of time. Unless you have big profits in the market you cannot offset your losses.The kind of massive bar that we had in March, the idea was that if we pullback into that bar, you buy and the market will be able to reward you. How many days did we correct? Hardly 5 days and again is the market at fresh highs. So, that shows you what kind of momentum and buying is visible at lower levels. So, I would not be surprised that we should soon cross 7900-8000 band and move on even further.If this market was weak your correction would not have ended in 5 days. Given that 7500 which is way higher than 6800 is now that base, downside seems fairly limited.Sonia: You have been telling us repeatedly that one should accumulate stocks in your portfolio and the time is now. If you had to identify 2 or 3 stocks that one can accumulate at this juncture for the longer term 1-2 years, what would they be?Gujral: Importance of this monsoon forecast cannot be underplayed because that really gives the positive trigger to look for beyond these results. That really puts the market in very good shape to accept bad results because bad results are history and good monsoon is still to happen. So, since markets discount the future it will be easier to absorb whatever negative surprises are there. So, clearly it is a time when things like M&M Financial which used to be Rs 400 stock has now begun to show momentum. It has had one good month, the second month has also started fairly well. So, out here you could see targets of Rs 350 and that is for a normal monsoon period where it recovers from bad results to average results.Mahindra & Mahindra which has broken out today, when you see this kind of a large bar, obviously some big money has really travelled into the stock and that is the time when retail should get in. Any sort of correction on Mahindra & Mahindra I think in the next 6 odd months you could easily do Rs 1700.Similarly Maruti seems to have bottomed out and there in the weeks to come you could easily see Rs 4200 which is its 200-day moving average. So, it is a mean reversion that will happen in Maruti.Anuj: What about something like Tata Motors which was up 10 percent this week or ICICI Bank which clearly drives markets more with the kind of weight that it has and that was up 9 percent this week?Gujral: Tata Motors has been doing well for longer than Maruti has been. However again double bottom at about Rs 280. I think next target here is about Rs 430. Once Rs 430 zone is taken out you basically have Rs 150 upside to Rs 580-600. So, double bottom, all kinds of longer term accumulation patterns are happening.Similarly ICICI Bank, I spoke about this last month also that it has really made a bottom at lower levels and just a mean reversion means Rs 280-300 type of target. You can just see the way these stocks are moving - 6 percent on ICICI Bank is not a small move. So, people who are creating these moves chances are plan to hold it for much longer time.Sonia: You did speak about the monsoon theme that one can still play at this juncture. Are there any other themes that you like, cement did exceptionally well in the last fortnight, sugar did well at one point in time but there was some profit taking. So, any thematic stories that you would like to play for the next couple of months?Gujral: Monsoon, what does help it? Not only agri and chemical stocks, things like BASF, Bayer CropScience, PI Industries, Escorts, these things have been totally beaten up, out of favour, nobody owns them. These are the stocks you buy but it helps overall consumption.So, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Symphony, Dabur, what have you, everything tends to move up. So, basically a good monsoon means that at least 50 percent of your market starts moving higher instead of just IT, pharmaceutical trying to support it. So, basically a good monsoon will spread itself all over the consumption space plus things which are directly related to agri. So, all of those spaces should move up from here. Anuj: For last many weeks you have been talking about correction of the under ownership in metals and names like Cairn India. Do you think large part of that has played out or do you see some more rally in names like Hindalco going forward? Gujral: The point is that the markets move much further than anybody expects. At 9,200 nobody expected 6,800. So, we have just seen 10 percent of our market move which is really nothing. Things tend to double, triple in a market cycle, so I won’t be surprised if Tata Steel can tomorrow get up to Rs 380-400. That would be just a doubling of Rs 200 price. So, there is much more ahead. Everybody had gotten out of metals and commodities totally over the last couple of years and just average weighting them and things just improving a little bit will lead to those prices. So, I don’t think it is fair to say that the re-rating is done or from here you should have downside. Markets are like a beast, once you leave a beast where it will stop that only the beast can decide. So, chances are that if you are cautious now, you will repent at 8,400. So the idea should be to get fully invested and hold for the longest period of time so that you are able to take advantage when the good news actually comes in from the effect on monsoon."

Mahesh Nandurkar of CLSA says a forecast of above normal monsoon by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the private forecaster Skymet augurs well for the agri GDP and overall growth outlook for FY17.

IMD's accuracy has improved over the last several years and forecasts are credible, he feels.

According to him, the rural economy should receive a welcome boost as a result and can potentially drive a 0.5-1 percent GDP impact, though a lot will depend on the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall.

In model portfolio, Nandurkar said he replaced Maruti Suzuki with Mahindra & Mahindra, where an easier base will help earnings growth improvement."

Passenger vehicle makers, including Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra & Mahindra, Toyota and Mercedes got together to find a way forward in the wake of the Supreme Court ban on registration of diesel cars and SUVs of engine capacity of 2,000 cc above in the capital and NCR.

A final decision wasn't taken on the road map and the top executives of the companies have agreed to meet later this week on how to address the issue over environmental compensation cess (ECC) as directed by the Supreme Court, according to industry sources.

""The top officials of some passenger car companies had a closed door meeting to discuss how to tackle the ECC issue.

They will be meeting later this week again to find a solution,"" a source said.

While some manufacturers had come to the meeting with the idea of accepting an ECC and get the ban lifted, others pointed to the long-term implications of such a move in case of other cities too demanding such cess by banning diesel vehicles, another source added.

""The idea of today's meeting was not to take a final decision of what we are going to do, but to hear out everyone present and what they best think is the way forward. We will continue to deliberate so that we can find a solution and report to the Supreme Court as directed,"" another source said.

The apex court, in its hearing on March 31, had directed the companies to sit together and come out with the ""propositions"" so that some solutions could be arrived at by holding a full-fledged hearing on Saturdays, a non-working day for the apex court, to save some ""judicial time"".

""Today's meeting was as per the court directions,"" a source said.

In December last year, the Supreme Court banned registration of diesel-run SUVs and cars having engine capacity beyond 2,000 cc in Delhi and NCR till March 31, as it unveiled a slew of measures to curb the alarming rise in pollution levels in the city.

On March 31 this year, the Supreme Court extended the ban till April 30.

Mercedes-Benz and Tata Motors-owned JLR are the worst hit due to the order as their entire diesel model range is powered by engines above 2,000 cc."

The home-grown auto major Tata Motors announced a tri-partite partnership with Bharat Forge and US-based General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) to bid for India's Rs 50,000-crore future infantry combat vehicle (FICV) project.

Tata Motors will lead the consortium with Bharat Forge as a partner while General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) will bring in its much-proven expertise in-combat vehicle platforms, the company said in a statement.

On the partnership, Tata Motors Executive Director, Commercial Vehicle, Ravi Pisharody said: ""Through this partnership, we will be better-positioned to help the country realise its 'Make in India' vision, for the first completely indigenised combat vehicle and at the same time cater to the opportunities available right here in India."" Bharat Forge Chairman and MD Baba N Kalyani said: ""Our proposed partnership will constitute an important milestone to help meet the Indian government's objectives to strengthen indigenous defence capabilities, and particularly in land systems, with FICV."" GDLS Vice-President (Tracked Combat Vehicles) Donald Kotchman said the partnership will help meet the requirements of the Ministry of Defence FICV programme.

""At General Dynamics Land Systems, we have established a track record of delivering and sustaining international programmes, in a timely and cost-effective manner throughout the platform's life,"" he added.

The Tata Motors-led consortium's response to the Ministry of Defence EoI (Expression of Interest) commits to indigenise through various Tata Group companies that play a vital role in the defence and aerospace sector, the company said, adding that it will also partner with firms with the most advanced competencies in development of ICVs, for the global market.

In January this year, Tata Motors had said it would discuss with the government to include consolidated revenues in determining eligibility to bid for the FICV project despite being ""confident"" of its domestic turnover meeting the financial criteria.

The company is among the 10 reported Indian firms in race for building FICV - a tracked, armoured vehicle that will protect infantrymen riding into battle.

We maintain our HOLD rating on the stock with SOTP based target price of INR 1283. M&M's Automobile segment volumes are expected to grow by 15.7% in FY17E primarily led by demand for new launches. On the farm equipment side, tractor volumes are expected to grow at 16.2% in FY17E on the prospects of better monsoon (after 2 consecutive years of tepid rainfall). For its new UV launches, M&M is keeping the price competitive, which is expected to cap upside in margin. We expect revenue & profit to grow at a CAGR of 14.7% & 17.7% respectively between FY15- 17E. Inspite of the positive factors, we maintain our Hold rating on the stock as the CMP prices in most of the benefits that may accrue to M&M over the next 1 year.

Auto major Mahindra & Mahindra today announced an increase in prices of its passenger vehicles by Rs 5,500 to Rs 47,000, effective April 1, to offset excise duty hike in Budget 2016-17.

Prices of recently launched KUV100, however, have been hiked with immediate effect.

""Though the 1-4 percent duty hikes are already effective, we have decided to pass on the price increases only from April 1. Prospective customers can still avail of our various passenger cars at the pre-Budget prices all through March.

""In absolute terms, prices will go up by Rs 5,500 to Rs 47,000, depending on the model and prevailing prices,"" Mahindra Chief Executive for passenger car business, Praveen Shah told PTI here today.

He, however, added that KUV100, launched mid-January will attract new prices with immediate effect. While the petrol model will be costlier by 1 percent, the diesel model will be dearer by 2.5 percent.

Following the Budget proposal to increase excise duty to the tune of 1-4 percent and an additional cess, almost all the automakers led by market leader Maruti have increased retail prices to pass on the duty increases and protect bottomlines.

While Maruti Suzuki India hiked car prices by up to Rs 34,494 to offset impact of infrastructure cess, Hyundai, Tata Motors, Toyota, Honda Cars, Mercedes-Benz, GM India, BWM, Renault, Nissan, Honda, and Skoda among others have also announced price hikes depending on their ex-showroom prices in each state.

Their new prices vary from Rs 2,000 (Tata Motors) to Rs 5 lakh (Merc). Merc and Skoda had increased the prices in January as well.

When asked about the customer response to KUV100, Shah said it has been very good forcing the company to ramp up production by an additional 3,000 units.

The decision to increase output comes as there is a 8-10 weeks waiting period for the new car as the company has 27,000 pending orders."

Edelweiss's research report on M&MKey takeaways from the call hosted by Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) to discuss budget implications of excise duty hike are: (1) M&M will pass on the hike; 2) 4% excise duty increase on Bolero, Xylo, Scorpio and XUV can impact near‐term demand, but in the past consumers have absorbed 3% hike; 3) rural stimulus to aid incomes and help lower excise impact on UV demand; and (4) normal monsoon remains key trigger for tractor demand recovery; other building blocks are in place for a sharp demand recovery (akin to M&HCVs). Management indicated margin will be impacted due to expiration of excise duty benefits at Haridwar plant (in Q4FY16 ~100bps; refer details on page 2). Hence, we revise down our FY17/18E EPS ~5% each. Maintain ‘BUY’ with SOTP‐based TP of INR1,337 (13x FY18E core business; INR346 for other businesses). We estimate EPS CAGR of 17% over FY16‐18 with an upside risk in case of faster recovery in rural demand (UVs/tractor) and stronger response to M&M’s new launches. Strong margin performance during tough times indicates the company’s profitability focus. We maintain ‘BUY/SO’ despite a modest 5% upside from CMP.

Emkay's research report on M&MCompany to raise prices for larger SUVs Bolero, Scorpio, XUV500 by 4%, TUV300 by 2.5% and KUV100 by ~1.7% (blended) to pass on the impact of infrastructure cess. Expects UV price hike to somewhat impact demand; despite slew of announcements for rural economy, tractor demand revival is still very dependent on good monsoons. Importantly, amidst the hike in prices owing to the infrastructure cess, the company said it will find it difficult to pass on the impact of the end of excise benefits at its Haridwar plant; this could impact OPM by upto ~100 bps. We lower our UV volume estimates and factor in lower margins leading to a 7%/6% cut in Standalone earnings estimates for FY17/FY18E. Retain ACCUMULATE with a lower TP of Rs 1,250 vs (Rs 1,310 earlier). We lower our estimates for utility vehicle sales for FY17/FY18E by 2% each to factor in some impact of price hike on demand.

The one percent tax collection at source (TCS) on luxury cars priced above Rs 10 lakh announced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in the Budget 2016-17 could impact ease of doing business, according to home-grown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra.

The tax would be collected on ex-showroom price. The dealer will have to collect and pay it to the government.

Since the TCS can be set off against tax liability, it is a timing issue, the company said in an analyst conference call.

""It would require some additional upfront payment from the customer. Coupled with increasing administrative hassles, it could impact ease of doing business,"" Mahindra & Mahindra said in the concall, excerpts of which were filed on BSE.

The company further said the TCS would be applicable on XUV500 and some models of Scorpio.

While the XUV500 is priced at Rs 11.5 lakh to RS 17.23 lakh (ex-showroom Mumbai), the Scorpio is available at a price range of Rs 8.62 lakh to Rs 14.08 lakh (ex-showroom Mumbai).

In his Budget speech, Jaitley had said: ""I also propose to collect tax at source at the rate of 1 percent on purchase of luxury cars exceeding value of Rs 10 lakh and purchase of goods and services in cash exceeding Rs 2 lakh."" For compliant tax payers with resources, this levy not only advances collection of tax when the expenditure is incurred, but it provides data to tax authorities to identify the persons who incur such expenditure but may be missing from the tax base.

""Farmers and notified class of persons will have an option of giving a form by which TCS will not be charged,"" the minister had said.

On the overall implications of the infrastructure cess of 1-4 percent on automobiles, M&M said: ""The cess will impact the entire industry, it does not discriminate between petrol and diesel. Hence, (there is) no competitive disadvantage to the company per se."" On a possible price hike, the company said: ""It is general practice to pass on statutory levy increases to customers, wherever it is an industry level increase. The company would also do so in due course of time, after SIAM's discussion."" While the petrol variant of its newly launched mini SUV KUV100 will attract a cess of 1 percent, M&M said its diesel variant and another SUV TUV300 will come under the slab of 2.5 percent cess slab. Bolero, Scorpio, XUV500 and Xylo will be charged at 4 percent.

""There might be some impact on volumes. However, it could be offset by factors such as increased rural demand and soft interest rates,"" M&M said.

In the Budget, Jaitley proposed 1 percent cess on petrol/LPG/CNG driven motor vehicles of length not exceeding 4 meter and engine capacity not exceeding 1,200 cc and 2.5 percent on diesel-driven motor vehicles of length not exceeding 4 meter and engine capacity not exceeding 1500 cc.

Other higher engine capacity and SUVs and bigger sedans will, however, attract a cess of 4 percent, Jaitley added."

Shares of Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) shed 4.4 percent intraday Wednesday. Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to neutral and slashed target price to Rs 1,310 after the company sees negative margin impact due to phase out of excise duty incentives at Haridwar plant.

The brokerage in its note says the company sees 100 basis points negative margin impact from Q4FY16 onwards due to phasing out of excise duty incentives at Haridwar plant.

Haridwar plant comprises 15 percent of M&M's total volumes including manufacturing of Scorpio and Bolero.

Credit Suisse recommended investors a switch from M&M to Maruti Suzuki as valuations of M&M are no longer compelling.

Infrastructure cess of 1-4 percent announced in Union Budget will also have an impact on auto companies. ""Infrastructure cess, of 1 percent on small petrol, LPG, CNG cars, 2.5 percent on diesel cars of certain capacity and 4 percent on other higher engine capacity vehicles and SUVs,"" says Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on February 29.

The infrastructure cess is sure to have a negative impact on overall demand, says VS Parthasarathy, CFO of M&M (in an interview to CNBC-TV18 today) but on other hand the various measures to boost rural economy, infrastructure and farmer income could help mitigate the negatives.

According to him, 1 percent TDS on passenger vehicles will not impact the costs of the vehicle because 1 percent TDS can be reclaimed by the customers.

However, the stock gained more than 3 percent in previous session after it reported 16 percent rise in total sales to 44,002 units year-on-year in February due to 18.4 percent jump in domestic sales but exports fell 15 percent in same period.

Demand in urban market remains to be strong while the rural demand continues to struggle, says Pravin Shah, president and chief executive-automotive at M&M on March 1. Regarding newly launched TUV300 and KUV100, he says both the vehicles are doing well and 27000 KUV100 have been booked so far. At 12:46 hours IST, the scrip of Mahindra and Mahindra was quoting at Rs 1,218.40, down Rs 47.85, or 3.78 percent on the BSE.Posted by Sunil Shankar Matkar"

India unveiled a fire-fighting budget on Monday that seeks to win back support among rural voters for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and sustain growth against a grim global backdrop - all without borrowing more.

The following sectors/companies will benefit or be hurt by the budget proposals:

WINNERS:

* AGRICULTURE

Jaitley said 359.84 billion rupees (USD5.3 billion) would be set aside for farmers' welfare for the year starting April 2016. The government will also launch aid schemes intended to help double farmers' incomes by 2022.

Jaitley also raised the agricultural credit target for 2016/17 to a record 9 trillion rupees, amid rising rural distress after a series of droughts in the country.

Companies such as Jain Irrigation, Mahindra and Mahindra, Monstanto India that supply agricultural equipment and seeds are likely to benefit.

* ROADS AND INFRASTRCTURE

Jaitley plans to allocate 550 billion rupees for developing roads and highways. Capital expenditure on development of roads, highways and railways has been set at 2.18 trillion rupees for the year.

The higher infrastructure spending bodes well for companies such as IRB Infrastructure Developers, Larsen and Toubro Ltd and Gammon Infrastructure Projects Ltd.

* NEW MANUFACTURING COS

New manufacturing companies incorporated on or after March 1, 2016 will be given an option to be taxed at a reduced rate of 25 percent plus surcharge and cess, provided they do not claim profit-linked or investment-linked deductions and do not use the investment allowance and accelerated depreciation.

* REAL ESTATE

Dividends from a special purpose vehicle to a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and an Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) will not be subjected to the Dividend Distribution Tax, the budget said, resolving a major hurdle for listing of REITs.

That would help companies, including DLF Ltd, Prestige Estates Projects Ltd, and Sobha Ltd, which have been waiting to list REITs.

Jaitley's plans to provide tax incentives for affordable housing are likely to benefit builders of low-cost homes, including Mahindra Lifespace Developers and Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd.

* ASSET RECONSTRUCTION COMPANIES

The government said it would allow so-called sponsors of asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), which buy bad loans from banks, to own 100 percent of the company. Foreign investors can fully own Indian ARCs without having to seek prior approval from the government.

The moves will help ARCs including Edelweiss ARC, JM Financial ARC and ARCIL raise more capital.

LOSERS:

* CARS

The budget proposed an infrastructure cess of 1 pct on small petrol, LPG, CNG cars, of 2.5 pct on diesel cars of certain capacity, and of 4 pct on other higher engine capacity vehicles and SUVs.

The budget also called for tax to be deducted at source at the rate of 1 percent for purchases of luxury cars exceeding a price of 1 million rupees.

India's largest automobile maker Maruti Suzuki Ltd and SUV-makers Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors are likely to be hurt.

* RETAIL and TEXTILE

Factory gate duty on readymade garments with a retail price of 1,000 rupees or more has been raised to 2 percent without input tax credit, or 12.5 percent with input tax credit.

Apparel retailers such as Aditya Birla Nuvo, Future Retail, and Shopper's Stop along with textile manufacturers such as Arvind Ltd are likely to be hurt.

* TOBACCO

Excise duties on various tobacco products have been raised by about 10 percent to 15 percent. Cigarettte makers such as ITC Ltd and VST Industries are likely to be affected.

* OIL EXPLORERS

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his budget changed the so-called Oil Industries Development Cess on locally produced crude oil from 4,500 rupees per tonne to 20 pct of the value of the commodity.

As Finance Minister Arun Jaitley presents Union Budget today, the market will focus on credibility of numbers. Investors will be keen to know if the govt deviates from the fiscal consolidation roadmap in order to boost growth. The other big fear the market has is the possible extension of the long term capital gains tax tenure from 1 to 3 years or the possibility of reintroduction of a tax itself.

This month, Indian market is among worst performing big markets this month. In dollar terms, India is worst performing market this month.

According to CNBC-TV18, in best case scenario, the Nifty could make a move to 7250-7300. However, the big question will be if fresh selling emerges if Nifty goes to 7250. In worst case scenario, Nifty could break recent low of 6,869, say CNBC-TV18 analyst.

So, as the market approaches Union Budget presentation at 11 pm, here are few stocks that you need to focus on:"

Buoyed by robust response to its newly-launched mini SUV KUV100, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is looking to enhance its market share in the utility vehicles segment beyond 40 percent.

The company is banking on the KUV100, which has crossed 21,000 bookings a month after launch, and its another new model TUV300, to gain additional volumes.

""Since its launch last month, the KUV100 has been received well in the market. We have crossed 21,000 bookings and 1.75 lakh inquiries,"" M&M President & Chief Executive (Automotive) Pravin Shah said.

He said the new model will help the company enhance its market share in the utility vehicles segment.

""This is a segment (mini SUV) which we have entered newly.

This will not only help us gain additional volumes but will also help increase our market share in the utility vehicles segment, which is nearly 40 percent at present,"" Shah said.

The company also expects the other new model TUV300 to contribute to the effort as ""we are doing around 3,500 to 4,000 units a month"", he added.

In the April-January period this fiscal, M&M had sold a total of 1,74,276 units of utility vehicles out of a total industry sales of 4,68,323 units in the segment.

Commenting on the demand for KUV100, Shah said at present the waiting period is around 3-4 months depending on the variant.

""We are looking to increase production, as we have stated at the time of launch. Today, we have a capacity to produce 9,000 units of the XUV500 and KUV100 combined. Within a couple of months we will increase it by an additional 3,000 units,"" he said.

The company's new petrol engine MFalcon G80, that powers the KUV100, has also been received well, Shah said.

With steps being taken up to resume India-EU FTA talks, automobile industry body SIAM today asked the government not to give in to the 28-nation bloc's demand to reduce import duties on fully-imported cars, even as German car maker Volkswagen came out in favour of such a cut.

In a departure from past process, Commerce Secretary Rita Teaotia had sought opinion from individual companies, including BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra apart from meeting officials of industry bodies SIAM and ACMA.

Earlier only a collective view of the industry was sought from SIAM and ACMA.

Teaotia will be leaving for Brussels to meet her European counterpart on February 22 to review the stalled negotiations.

""We met Commerce Secretary as she wanted to understand the issues of automobile sector. We put forth our demand of non-inclusion of CBU imports in the talks,"" SIAM Deputy Director General Sugato Sen told PTI.

SIAM has been maintaining that the reduction of customs duties on imported cars run against the spirit of 'Make in India' as it will hurt investment in the automobile sector, which is among the biggest contributor to India's manufacturing sector.

When contacted, a Tata Motors spokesperson confirmed company representatives participating in the meeting and said: ""We are in line with SIAM views."" A Volkswagen India representative also confirmed that the company was invited for the meeting but could not attend due to prior commitments with Make in India week celebrations in Mumbai.

""We are in favour of India-EU FTA as it will result in inflow of new technologies and will sharpen competitiveness of the Indian automotive industry. The import duty reduction will be only on high-end luxury cars and not on mass segment cars,"" a Volkswagen Group India spokesperson said.

A Maruti Suzuki India spokesperson declined to comment.

The purpose of the meeting in Brussels later this month is to assess where both sides stand and how India and the EU should go forward with the proposed pact, officially dubbed as Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement.

The last round of trade talks between the two sides happened in May 2013. In that meeting India and the 28-nation bloc failed to bridge substantial gaps on crucial issues, including data security status for the IT sector.

Besides demanding significant duty cuts in automobiles, EU wants tax reduction on wines and spirits and dairy products and a strong intellectual property regime.

The free trade pact is aimed at reducing or significantly eliminating tariffs on goods, facilitating trade in services and boosting investments between the two sides.

The two-way commerce in goods between India and the EU was USD 98.5 billion in 2014-15."

Mahindra's participation in the world championship for electric cars Formula E will help the company in development of mass-produced eco-friendly vehicles, according to a top official of the series.

With technology already trickling down, innovation in the electric racing car around battery, drive train and charging system will help in the design and development of the vehicles at large scale in the long run, Formula E Director of Media and Strategic Partnerships Ali Russell told PTI.

Company's engineers are working to learn from the racing series and already there is a transfer of information between the race team and the factory, he said.

""Engineers from Mahindra who work in the factory, spend time in the race outlet. What happens even now, they are getting to understand cooling systems, chemistry behind the batteries, about high performance, how to get more out of an electric motor,"" he said.

When asked how soon technology from Formula E cars can be seen in road cars, he said,""it is already (happening) with small engineering points that are being transferred in car design. In the long term we dream about the battery coming through Formula E."" Russell said the idea behind Formula E is that the international motorsport body FIA has been looking ""at creating a sport that creates innovation for the electric car industry"".

""With these innovations, we want to be cost effective be it for electric drive train, battery and charging system,"" he added.

Mahindra, like most other companies, has invested heavily in the electric cars and has helped in creation of new intellectual properties.

""Moving forward, the innovation in the car around battery, drive train and charging system will help in the design and development of mass production (electric) vehicle,"" Russell said.

Earlier, Mahindra & Mahindra Executive Director Pawan Goenka had told PTI that the company ""hoped that through the racing we will be able to bring technologies to our road cars.

It is a gradual thing."" He however hastened to add that it is a long process and not something that would happen in a year as what goes into racing cars are too expensive to come immediately to road cars.

On the Indian market, Russell said: ""We want to be a catalyst in creation and innovations for urban and green mobility in India."" Mahindra is taking part in Formula E through its Mahindra Racing team. This season it is racing with its M2Electro, making it one of a select few manufacturers that developed an all new electric powertrain for the series.

The racing car can accelerate from 0-100kms under 3 seconds.

The company's electric vehicle line-up includes small car e20 and sedan Verito Electric, besides passenger vehicle Maxximo Electric."

Homegrown diversified group Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) on Friday announced plans to consolidate its agri business under a single entity by transferring its agriculture division to a wholly-owned arm.

Company's Board of Directors approved a proposal to transfer the agri business to Mahindra Shubhlabh Services Ltd (MSSL), M&M said in a BSE filing.

The agri business of the company consists of crop care, seeds, pulses, edible oils, basmati rice, potato, potato flakes and dairy, besides an investment in Mahindra HZPC Pvt Ltd (MHZPC) - a joint venture with HZPC Holland BV for seed potatoes, it added.

The step is aimed to ""consolidate agri business under an entity. This consolidation would help unlock synergies between various individual verticals and help offer end-to-end solutions for farmer needs across agricultural value chain"".

M&M Chairman Anand Mahindra said the group's agri business is aligned to its long-term vision of delivering ""FarmTech Prosperity"".

""With close to 50 per cent of the population of the country dependent on agriculture, it offers us an opportunity to truly live the Mahindra Rise philosophy, by driving positive change,"" he said.

The group has multiple businesses under different entities, bringing them all together would provide the right environment to maximise synergies and create value for all stakeholders, Mahindra said.

""Our Agri Business has reached a critical mass now and this new entity would provide an opportunity to fully leverage the potential that these businesses offer and thus, function as an end-to-end provider in the agri value chain,"" M&M Executive Director Pawan Goenka said.

The agri businesses would also have three brands --Samriddhi for selling of agri inputs, Saboro for high quality fruits, and NuPro for pulses and edible oils.

The income of the agri business, excluding the income of Rs 21.6 crore of MHZPC, was Rs 211.35 crore as on March 31, 2015.

With this consolidation, all of M&M's Agri Businesses would now come under MSSL, which was set up in 2003 for the export of grapes and is one of the largest exporters of the fruit from India. It exports to Europe, the Middle East, Russia and South East Asia.

M&M however said its micro irrigation arm EPC Industries would continue as a direct subsidiary."

The carnage in the stock market on Thursday made Dalal Street investors poorer by over Rs 3 lakh crore, where the benchmark Sensex tumbled by more than 800 points, amid a massive sell-off in banking shares and worries over global economic slowdown.

The Sensex on Thursday closed 807.07 points down at 22,951.83 points -- the lowest closing level for the index since May 8, 2014.

Intra-day, it slumped 849.78 points to 22,909.1 -- its 52-week low.

This was also the fourth straight session of losses for the index which has fallen by 1,665 points.

Following the extreme weakness in stocks, the market capitalisation (m-cap) of BSE-listed firms plunged by Rs 3.18 lakh crore to Rs 86,30,930 crore.

So far this year, the market valuation of BSE-listed companies has come down sharply by Rs 14 lakh crore from Rs 1,00,37,734 crore on December 31, 2015.

Markets fell steeply on the back of continuing concerns about a global slowdown and consequent impact on the financial sector.

""Quarterly results declared over the past few days have also not met up to the muted expectations and that also impacted sentiments,"" said Dipen Shah, Senior Vice-President & Head of Private Client Group Research, Kotak Securities.

Going ahead, global concerns will remain at centre-stage and will likely dictate market sentiments, he added.

Following today's fall, the Sensex has come off over 23 percent from its all-time peak of 30,024 points recorded on March 4, 2015.

It was a sea of red at the BSE Sensex, where 28 out of the 30-bluechip scrips suffered losses.

Adani Ports, BHEL, Tata Motors, ONGC, Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Steel were the top losers.

Cipla and Dr Reddys Lab, however, ended with mild gains.

""Bears tightened their grip across the globe. Relentless selling in the stock market is coming from redemption pressures, crude slumping to multi-year lows, depreciating rupee against dollar and disappointing earnings,"" said Gaurav Jain, Director, Hem Securities.

At the BSE, 2,359 stocks declined, while only 324 advanced. The prices of 96 stocks remained unchanged.

""The colour of the day was red as the selling rout of the previous 3 sessions intensified today, pushing key benchmark indices in India to trade at 21 month lows,"" said Shreyash Devalkar, Fund Manager of Equities, BNP Paribas Mutual Fund."

Homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra is working to apply the learnings from Formula E racing on its electric cars as it looks to ride on rising awareness for eco-friendly vehicles. The company, which has bagged large orders for its electric cars from taxi aggregators in Bengaluru and the Capital, is hopeful that 2016 will mark the ""taking off"" for electric mobility in India riding on government support and popularisation through the world championship racing of electric cars, Formula E. ""Our hope is that through the racing we will be able to bring technologies to our road cars. It is a gradual thing,"" Mahindra & Mahindra Executive Director Pawan Goenka told agency. He, however, hastened to add that it is a long process and not something that would happen in a year as what goes into racing cars are too expensive to come immediately to road cars. Bullish on the growth of electric vehicles in India, Goenka said taxi aggregators have also shown interest and the company has bagged order for 100 e20 electric car from a firm called Lithium in Bengaluru and for 50 e-Verito sedans from a separate entity.

""This is slowly going to build now. Once the visibility comes in, more and more people will opt for the electric vehicles (EVs). I am hoping that 2016 is the year when EVs really take off in India,"" Goenka said.

A combination of factors, such as government support and push for EVs, awareness after the success of Formula E racing and the company's own efforts to popularise would help in raising demand for such eco-friendly vehicles. Commenting on Formula E, he said it has picked up really well globally with packed stands on race days which has also resulted in increased awareness of EVs. ""In India there is no race (Formula E) but there is a lot of TV viewership. I believe India could have a race, that will be a really good thing,"" Goenka said, adding that for M&M the racing series is about ""a fairly large brand play with global coverage"" besides all the technological learnings."

Sharekhan's research on Auto sectorThe passenger vehicle sales in January 2016 were off on a rough pitch with the largest domestic car maker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL), posting a marginal increase in sales. The other car manufacturers including Tata Motors (TAMO) posted a decline of 17.8% in the passenger vehicle segment in the domestic markets. The two-wheeler volumes remained weak due to the continued sluggishness in rural demand. Royal Enfield (Eicher Motors) bucked the industry trend registering a strong volume growth of 65% YoY. The commercial vehicle segment continued to grow on the back of higher growth from the MHCV segment. The LCV segment remained subdued on the back of weaker demand from urban areas. Industry majors TAMO and Ashok Leyland Ltd (ALL) have registered a strong volume growth of 30% and 40% YoY respectively in the MHCV segment. The tractors exhibited a flattish growth with the industry leader Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) registering a minimal growth of 1% on a Y-o-Y basis. The market leader MSIL registered a decline of 2.6% YoY for the month of January 2016 on the back of lesser no. of working days and maintenance shut downs taken by the company. The newly launched Baleno and Celerio upgrade failed to sustain the traction gained initially. Contrary to MSIL, Hyundai reported a strong set of numbers for the month of January 2016 registering a growth of 9.3% YoY. The new launches by the company like the Creta, I20 and Grand (upgrade) helped in gaining traction in the sales volumes for the month. The utility major, M&M, registered a 13.4% Y-o-Y rise in the UV segment. The new launches KUV100 and TUV300 drove the sales volumes for the company higher in the month of January 2016. The total passenger vehicle segment for M&M grew at 12.8% YoY to 22,088 units. TAMO registered a decline of 17.8% YoY in the passenger vehicle segment in the domestic markets. The company is likely to launch ZICA (as per media reports, TAMO might reconsider the name of owing to outbreak of Zika virus), in the upcoming auto expo. The new launch might aid volume revival for the TAMO in the passenger car segment.

Fourteen months of consecutive growth in car volumes and a strong uptick in commercial vehicles may have brought some cheer to automakers, but companies maintain recovery will remain fragile, unless the Budget offers some serious support..

Carmakers, commercial vehicle manufacturers or two-wheeler giants, FY16 has not been particularly kind to any of them. Though there have been pockets of good fortune, overall growth has emerged uneven and anaemic.

While the passenger car segment has seen a cumulative growth of nine percent, commercial vehicle volumes have grown 8.5 percent in the April-December period. However, the motorcycle segment has taken quite a serious knock, with growth falling 2.5 percent.

New launches are their weapon of choice — whether it's the Bajaj V, Honda's 110-cc Navi, or Hero's Splendor i-smart. But manufacturers say any real turnaround will hinge on what Budget 2016 has to offer.

Pawan Munjal, chairman, Hero Motocorp, says: ""There is a slowdown in the motorcycle market and hoping government announces something for rural sector to help stem the decline…""

Granted, the government has been making all the right noises, but the fact that none of this has translated to growth on the ground is a tad worrisome.

Anand Mahindra, chairman, Mahindra Group, says: ""Don't know how to read the economy, government doing right things but effects not tricking down.""

Passenger car volumes may have grown for 14 months in a row, but that has been entirely due to two companies — Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai — which together account for over 75 percent of the market. And even these companies say the Budget could make or break that trend.

Rakesh Srivastava, senior VP - sales and marketing, Hyundai Motor India, says: ""The Budget is a very important moment for the industry. We are hoping there are measures to boost infrastructure.""

Speaking of infrastructure, the infrastructure outlay in Budget 2016 is a big concern for companies making medium and heavy commercial vehicles, especially if they are to repeat the 30 percent volume growth clocked in 2015, or push 2016 sales to a five-year high above 240,000 units.

Ravi Pisharody, ED — commercial vehicles, Tata Motors, says: ""The infrastructure outlay should remain high like last year. India needs to catch up with other countries and that would give a boost to mining.""

The stakes are clearly high and if the government wants to increase private investments as it has been promising, companies say an industry-friendly Budget is the way to go, especially if the 'Make-in-India' dream is to be kept alive."

The cricketing fraternity too had a fair share of representation in the form of Sachin Tendulkar, Zaheer Khan, Virat Kohli, Piyush Chawla and former cricket legend Mohinder Amarnath. Around 5.6 lakh people had visited the show during the last edition in 2014. The Auto Expo 2016 had 65 manufacturers from across the globe exhibiting products.

Some of the major participants would be Maruti Suzuki India, Mahindra, Hyundai Motor India, Honda Cars India, Tata Motors and Audi, among others. New participants included Jeep, Polaris, and Italian motorcycle maker Benelli. Some companies have also given it a miss citing high costs and low returns on investments.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have reduced their exposure in 30 Nifty companies during October-December quarter as they recast their portfolio primarily on account of global factors. However, FPIs, on an aggregate basis, holding in 50-share Nifty inched up marginally to 28.9 percent during the period under review, according to a report by ICICI Securities. FPIs, which pulled out over Rs 3,200 crore from stock markets in the October-December quarter, flow in equities may continue to remain weak in the fourth quarter of the ongoing fiscal 2015-16.

""Quarter-on quarter basis, in aggregate, FPIs holding in Nifty stocks inched up marginally to 28.9 percent even after they trimmed holding in 30 Nifty stocks,"" the report noted. This phenomena can be attributed to the concentration of FPIs holdings in select quality stocks (high return on equity (ROE), high cash flow and low leverage) which relatively outperformed low quality stocks (low ROE, low cash flow and high debt) in FPI portfolios. ""Nonetheless, the sell off in response to the systematic risk in emerging markets has resulted in negative returns in quality stocks thereby making them attractive during the current phase of risk aversion,"" it added.

Of the 50 Nifty companies, FPIs trimmed stake in 30 stocks, while the report did not specify ownership status of the remaining 20 firms. In comparison, FPIs had reduced their shareholding in 35 firms during the July-September quarter and 41 companies in April-June quarter. FPIs reduced significant (more than two percent) stake in three companies - Ambuja Cement, Vedanta and Mahindra Finance during the quarter under review.

However, FPIs have more than 25 percent stake in 23 Nifty stocks. Besides, their holding is at a two-year high in four companies -- Lupin, Maruti Suzuki, BPCL and Wipro. During the third quarter, top FPI 'buys' were Maruti Suzuki, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Mahindra & Mahindra, Wipro and Federal Bank, while top 'sell' list are Sun Pharma, L&T, Axis Bank, Ambuja Cement and Bharti Airtel.

Interestingly, 30 percent of FPIs holding are concentrated in only five stocks - HDFC, Infosys, HDFC Bank, and Reliance Industries."

From rural motorbike sales to rail freight, economists and even the central bank are devising their own ways to measure Indian growth.

Their verdict? It's a good deal weaker than official data showing India to be the world's most dynamic big economy.

Doubts about the accuracy of India's gross domestic product figures persist a year after its statisticians unveiled new readings they say better capture value addition down the goods and services supply chain.

Under the new methodology, economists expect India will report GDP growth of 7.3 percent on Monday for the October-December quarter, according to a Reuters poll. That's a touch slower than the previous quarter but comfortably surpasses the 6.8 percent growth posted by China.

While that number appears strong, the lack of a historical series - still in the works - makes it hard to conclude that Asia's third-largest economy is doing well at a time when firms report poor sales, bank lending is slow and investment is weak.

""It doesn't feel like we are growing at 7-8 percent,"" said one official familiar with the Reserve Bank of India's research methods.

Like other economists, the RBI is now turning to hybrid models that mix elements of the old and new GDP methods to get a better feel for the underlying health of the economy.

The RBI looks at two-wheeler sales, car sales, rail freight, and consumer goods sales in rural areas ""to get a better understanding of the ground realities"", this official said.

The new data is a headache too for Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who faces tough choices in his February 29 Budget over whether to hike borrowing and spending to compensate for the sluggish private sector.

HEAT MAP

By its own proprietary measure, Ambit Capital estimates the economy may have grown an annualised 5 to 6 percent in the October-December quarter.

""India is not the fastest growing economy in the world,"" said Ritika Mankar Mukherjee, an Ambit economist in Mumbai.

""No matter how you cut it, while there are certain segments of the economy holding up such as IT or e-commerce, large parts of the economy are actually slowing down.""

Economists have drawn on techniques used by colleagues covering China, where GDP figures are widely suspected to have been smoothed for years by its communist rulers to underpin popular faith in their economic stewardship.

Ambit looks at criteria such as motor vehicle sales, power demand, and imports of capital goods to determine the real rate of expansion. Meanwhile, Citigroup has developed a heat map of 18 economic activities including two-wheeler sales, air traffic, and diesel sales.

Downbeat assessments of growth would more closely correspond with trends under the old GDP calculation method that until a year ago showed India experiencing the longest spell of sub-5 percent growth in a quarter of a century.

The slowdown is especially pronounced in rural areas, which have suffered two consecutive dry years.

""Demand is very weak because farmers' income has been squeezed by drought,"" said a Mahindra and Mahindra tractor dealer in Aurangabad, in the state of Maharashtra, who reckons his sales are down more than 20 percent from a year ago.

Ashish Kumar, who recently retired as the head of India's statistics office, says economists are using the wrong gauges to understand data that measures value addition.

""You have to understand that the new GDP data essentially captures efficiency,"" he told Reuters. ""Comparing it with volume-based indicators would be a mistake.""

RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has also endorsed the new GDP readings, saying sliding input costs are offsetting shrinking corporate revenues and inflating value-addition. Put more simply, sales may be slow but profits are rising.

Still, the statistics office is readying tools to better capture services sector data for GDP calculations and supplement it with employment generation data.

""Once we have all these data points, we will get a better picture,"" said Kumar."

The biennial automotive show Auto Expo will kick off tomorrow with over 80 new models slated to be unveiled in the next two days. While the first two days are open to media and business visitors, the expo will be thrown open to the public from February 5-9. An estimated 7 lakh visitors are expected during the expo.

The show, jointly organised by SIAM (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers), ACMA (Automotive Components Manufacturers Association) and the Confederation of Indian Industry, will take place at India Expo Mart, Greater Noida. SIAM President Vinod K Dasari had said that the expo this time would focus on electric and hybrid vehicles with a theme of mobility for all. The auto expo is being held at a time when the automobile manufacturers are under pressure amid rising concerns over pollution, specially in Delhi-NCR, where diesel SUVs and cars with engines above 2,000 cc have been banned following a Supreme Court order.

Some of the major participants would be Maruti Suzuki India, Mahindra, Hyundai Motor India, Honda Cars India, Tata Motors and Audi, among others. New participants include Jeep, Polaris, and Italian motorcycle maker Benelli. Some companies have also given it a miss citing high costs and low returns on investments.

These include Bajaj Auto, Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV), Royal Enfield and Harley Davidson. Bajaj Auto MD Rajiv Bajaj yesterday said it is too expensive to participate in the biennial show and wasteful to create expensive concepts. Nevertheless, the organises have been upbeat that there will be an increase in the number of footfalls to 7 lakh this time.

Around 5.6 lakh people visited the show during the last edition. The show will see 65 exhibitors as against 55 in the previous edition which saw launch of around 70 products. Exhibition space has also been increased to 73,000 square meters from the earlier 69,000 square meters.

Coinciding with the Auto Expo, ACMA will host the components show at the Capital's Pragati Maidan from February 4-7, in which around 1,500 exhibitors are expected to participate. Around 900 of them are Indian firms, while the remaining 600 are from overseas, including China, Canada, Germany, Japan and South Korea. Auto Expo is being held at Greater Noida for the second successive time as its original home Pragati Maidan proved inadequate to host the show, which has grown over the years."

Homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra today said it has completed sale of its entire 71.19 percent stake in Swaraj Automotives Ltd (SAL) for Rs 24.84 crore to b4S Solutions. The company completed the sale of 17,06,925 equity shares of Rs 10 each yesterday, M&M said in a BSE filing. Last year in October, the company had entered into an agreement with b4S Solutions for the sale of its entire stake in SAL.

Under the agreement, the company had fixed the price at Rs 145.5 per equity share.

Carmakers are gearing up to launch affordable hybrid and electric cars for India in the next few years, executives said, lured by government incentives for fuel-efficient vehicles as the country accelerates efforts to cut worsening air pollution. As the industry descends on smog-bound New Delhi for India's biggest car show, starting Wednesday, foreign firms like Toyota Motor Corp will join domestic players like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra in displaying green cars designed to reel in potential buyers.

The stakes are high in one of the fastest-growing car markets in the world. While hybrid and electric cars now make up a tiny fraction of sales, new government aid worth up to $2,000 per car could help catapult green vehicles to nearly a third of a 5 million car market by 2020, IHS Automotive says.

""It is not enough to just introduce new technology in India, you have to make it relevant for the market and the buyers,"" said C.V. Raman, head of engineering at Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, India's top-selling carmaker.

India's rampant pollution has forced the government's hand. The Supreme Court last month ordered an overnight temporary ban on the sale of large diesel cars in New Delhi, among the world's most polluted cities.

Carmakers were left jittery, many having invested heavily in comparatively cheap diesel technology over the years to conquer India.

Reliance on imported parts still makes full-scale hybrid technology cars expensive, but with India's new sales incentives, 'semi-hybrid' technology is seen as a potential longer term solution.

HYBRID ACCELERATION

To incentivise carmakers, the government introduced a scheme last year called FAME - Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric cars - that offers concessions of up to 138,000 rupees ($2,032) on the sale of such cars.

The scheme, introduced before the New Delhi court order and originally planned for two years, will now likely be extended till 2020.

To be sure, some carmakers, like General Motors Co, Hyundai Motor Co and Honda Motor Co, are yet to be convinced on hybrid technology potential in India. Instead, they will focus their presence at the New Delhi auto show on gas-guzzling sport-utility vehicles.

Toyota is among those now looking at bringing in a hybrid variant for future models, as well as cars it now sells in India, which is also moving towards stricter emission norms.

""Our strategy is to go for hybridisation,"" said Naomi Ishii, head of Toyota's India unit. Ishii did not give a specific timeline, but said the Japanese carmaker will first bring hybrid in for its top-end models and then in the mass segment, mainly because of the high cost of imported components.

Meanwhile Maruti, majority-owned by Suzuki Motor Corp, has already invested in developing a low-cost version of hybrid technology, irrespective of government incentives. Maruti says the technology combines fuel efficiency and lower emissions, but is not as expensive as existing traditional hybrid technology."

Hit by ban of registration of diesel SUVs and cars with engines above 2,000cc in Delhi-NCR, homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra on Friday launched a 1.99 litre version of its mHawk engine series. ""This engine would power the New Generation Scorpio as well as the New Age XUV500. It would be available for customers within the Delhi and NCR Region to begin with,"" the company said in a statement.

Mahindra & Mahindra President and Chief Executive, Auto Division Pravin Shah said: ""This new engine, the development of which started in August 2014, is now ready for launch on both the New Generation Scorpio and the New Age XUV500."" Previously, these two vehicles were powered by 2.2 litre mHawk engines. The new 1.99 litre engine will power the new generation Scorpio and will deliver 120 HP while for the new XUV500, it will deliver 140 HP, the company said.Last month, Supreme Court had banned registration of new SUVs and cars powered by diesel engines of 2,000cc and above in the Capital and NCR till March 31 in the wake of rising pollution.

Religare’s research report on Mahindra & Mahindra;

We attended Mahindra & Mahindra’s KUV100 launch today at the company’s Chakan plant in Pune. Aggressively priced at Rs 442,000- Rs 676,000 and positioned as a mini SUV, the KUV100 will go head-on against B-segment hatchbacks Maruti Swift and Hyundai Grande i10. The launch also marks MM’s entry into the PV petrol segment, with the new 1.2ltr petrol (as well as diesel) variants and attractive pricing set to lure first-time SUV buyers. We estimate monthly volumes for KUV100 to be in the sub-5000 range. Maintain HOLD; Sep’16 TP Rs 1,330.

Competing with 4W giants: MM has launched the KUV100 in eight variants, both petrol and diesel, in an attractive price range of Rs 442,000-Rs 676,000 (ex-showroom Pune). Slated as direct competition to Maruti Suzuki’s Swift and Hyundai’s Grande i10, the KUV100 would compete in the sub-4m hatchback and sedan segment (~50% of PV market). The KUV100 will have the new 1.2ltr petrol and diesel engines from the newly-launched mFalcon engines built to deliver high low-end torque for a peppy performance. MM has incurred ~Rs 12bn on the product and new engines.

Marks entry into petrol segment: The KUV100 marks MM’s entry into compact petrol hatchbacks with a SUV-stance product. The foray into petrol engines would further expand to 2.2litre engines for Scorpio and XUV500, post which company would look at the 1.5litre variant. Establishing its footprint and competing with established petrol hatchbacks remains a key task ahead for MM.

Volume expectation: KUV100 will be manufactured on the same line as XUV500 with a combined monthly capacity of 9,000 vehicles, which would expand to 12,000 units in the next three months. Starting volumes are expected to be in the sub-5,000 range.

Auto major Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is working on ""various options"" to ensure sales of its flagship products do not suffer in the long-term following Supreme Court's recent ban on registration of diesel SUVs and cars above 2,000cc in the entire NCR till March 31. ""We are looking at various options that we can have and I am sure our teams will come out with an option which is in line with the SC direction that would be given and we will be able to sell our vehicles back in NCR area,"" M&M executive president Pawan Goenka told reporters at its manufacturing plant here. The Supreme Court last month banned the registration of diesel SUVs and cars above 2,000cc in the entire National Capital Region till March 31, following heightened concerns over the pollution levels in the region.

Along with multinationals like Mercedes Benz, Audi etc, M&M has been impacted by the ban as its top selling SUV offerings like Bolero, XUV5OO and Scorpio have displacement of over 2,000 CC. According to reports, the NCR region accounts for two per cent of the company's overall sales. M&M today launched its compact SUV, KUV1OO, which runs on an internally developed 1,198 cc petrol or diesel engine and Goenka said work on engines of other sizes is on.

""Now we are working on 2.2 litre petrol engine both in Scorpio and XUV500 and we will be announcing that soon. Of course, doing the engine into a vehicle takes a long time even if an engine is available,"" he said. Apart from that, work has started on the 1.5 litre engine and it also has access to 1.6 litre engine developed by its South Korean subsidiary, Ssangyong, which is also working on a 2-litre engine."

Around 80 new models will be unveiled at the upcoming India's flagship automobile show, the Auto Expo, which is expected to draw around 7 lakh visitors. The five-day show, jointly organised by SIAM (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers), ACMA (Automotive Components Manufacturers Association) and the Confederation of Indian Industry, will take place from February 5-9 at Greater Noida. ""There will be around 80 product launches during the event. We expect 7 lakh footfalls this time around. Around 5.6 lakh people visited the show during the last edition of the show,"" SIAM President Vinod K Dasari told reporters here. The show will see 65 exhibitors as against 55 in the previous show, he added.

In the previous edition of the expo around 70 products were launched. ""The focus this time around would be on electric and hybrid vehicles with a theme of mobility for all,"" Dasari said. In order to make the show accessible for the general public, there would be shuttle bus service from Botanical Garden metro station to the India Expo Mart in Greater Noida, the venue of the motor show, he added.

Elaborating on the venue, Dasari said the space has been increased to 73,000 square meter from the earlier 69,000 square meters. Some of the major auto companies which would be participating in the show includes Maruti Suzuki India, Mahindra and Mahindra, Hyundai Motor India, Honda Cars India, Tata Motors, Audi among others. There will be new participants, including Jeep, Polaris, and Italian motorcycle maker Benelli.

Coinciding with the Auto Expo, ACMA will host the components show at the Capital's Pragati Maidan from February 4-7, in which around 1,500 exhibitors are expected to participate. Around 900 of them are Indian firms, while the remaining 600 are from overseas, including China, Canada Germany, Japan and South Korea. This is the second successive time that the Auto Expo is being held at Greater Noida with its original home Pragati Maidan proving to be inadequate to host the show, which has grown over the years.

CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said the industry is in talks with the government to establish at least one world-class exhibition centre soon as India currently lacks it when compared to US, Europe or China. ""We are working with the government to see if we can have at least one venue soon. The private sector will be happy to bring in equity and even operate it.

Shweta Mungremoneycontrol.comIt was an action packed week for the automobile sector, even as the mixed set of sales numbers for December points to a patchy recovery. Commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles sales grew at a healthy double digit year-on-year and two-wheeler sales remained sluggish.

Scepticism was rife on whether the Delhi government’s odd-even scheme, as a first step towards controlling pollution, would bear any fruit. After lot of counter arguments on the difficulties in practical implementation and tough questioning from the Delhi High Court (HC) on the extent of actual benefit, the scheme successfully completed its first week in the capital city.

The Delhi HC has now reserved its final hearing on whether the scheme can be continued further, for January 11, before which the state government is expected to produce evidence on the real impact on the particulate matter (PM) level, compared to the December range.

Another related directive, to ban the registration of diesel vehicles over engine capacity of 2000 cc, first issued by the National Green Tribunal and subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court, also saw retaliation from the auto industry association as well as manufacturers like Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M), Toyota and Mercedes. These companies have the maximum number of products in the 2000cc+ category. The Supreme Court, however, stayed put on its decision.

Meanwhile, as part of its contribution in reducing vehicular-led environmental hazards on a pan-India basis, the Indian government also announced its decision to skip Bharat Stage (BS)-V emission norms and leapfrog to BS-VI. Currently, BS-IV implementation is in progress in different parts of the country, with a deadline of April 1, 2017.

BS-VI emission norms will now be applicable from April 1, 2020 onwards, a year earlier than previous deadline. Oil refining companies have also been directed to invest Rs 30,000 crore, to ensure the auto manufacturers are supplied BS-VI compliant fuel.

According to a report by Edelweiss, ‘total price hike of direct transition from BS-IV to BS-VI would be 2-4 percent of the on road price for entry petrol and CNG vehicles,”. The report further points out that the industry typically sees a lot of pre-buying as the deadline approaches.

The week also saw some new product launches / announcements by Maruti Suzuki, M&M and Bajaj Auto. Maruti launched the new Swift DZire equipped with auto gear shift (AGS) technology and revealed the name of its much awaited compact SUV to be unveiled at the Auto Expo scheduled in February. The SUV will be called Vitara Brezza.

Bajaj Auto announced its plan to launch 3 new bikes in 2016, while also highlighting that it will focus on clocking 70,000 units per month in its executive segment from the current 20,000 units. The company also announced that its Austrian partner KTM is considering driving into the Indonesian market and is relying on Bajaj Auto to power its business in the country.

M&M also launched its new small commercial vehicle (SCV), Mahindra Imperio, as a replacement for aging model Genio, while the Renault-Nissan alliance rolled out its 1 millionth car in India from its Chennai plant."

Some of the past presidents of automotive industry body SIAM have come together to consult with heads of other carmakers to figure out a way forward after the Supreme Court banned registration of all diesel SUVs and cars with engines above 2,000 cc in Delhi/NCR. According to industry sources, the informal group was to take inputs from the CEOs of the auto companies on how to deal with the issue. Some of SIAM past presidents in the group include Mahindra & Mahindra Executive Director Pawan Goenka, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Vice-Chairman Vikram Kirloskar and Eicher Motors' Chairman S Sandilya, sources said.

Goenka, Kirloskar and Sandilya could not be reached for comments. The auto industry has been grappling with uncertainty after the Supreme Court order on December 16 banning registration of diesel-run SUVs and cars having engine capacity above 2,000 cc in Delhi and National Capital Region till March 31 as part of a slew of measures to curb the alarming rise in pollution levels in the city. The worst hit by the apex court order are German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz and Tata Motors-owned JLR as their entire diesel model range is powered by engines above 2,000 cc.

The other automakers who have been severely hit by the ban include Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Toyota Kirloskar Motor, with many of their popular models having engines above 2,000 cc. Delhi, along with Mumbai, is the largest market for luxury vehicles in India. According to industry estimates, the capital city accounts for about 20 percent of total luxury vehicle sales in the country."

Mahindra & Mahindra plans to launch a premium pickup range under the brand name Imperio next month as the company looks to further consolidate its position in the light commercial vehicle segment. The premium pickup range would be manufactured at the company's Chakan plant and will be introduced in the country in early January, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) said in a statement.

The pickup has been conceptualised and developed in house by the company's engineers at its Chennai-based R&D facility, it added. ""Being a customer centric and listening organisation, we identify the need gaps among consumers which has gone into the designing of the Imperio which will meet the evolving needs of customer,"" M&M President and Chief Executive (Automotive) Pravin Shah said.

Since the company is the market leader in small commercial vehicle segment, the launch of Imperio will further consolidate its leadership in the commercial vehicle space, he added.

Mahindra holds 53 percent market share in the light commercial vehicle (LCV) segment having less than 3.5 tonnes load. The new pickup is designed to cater to the needs of small and medium businesses (SMEs) while being the epitome of style, performance and driving comfort, the company said. M&M shares today ended 0.45 percent down, at Rs 1,252.85 on BSE."

First came the Delhi government’s directive on the odd-even number regulation, which allows plying of private vehicles with only even numbered plates on certain days of the week and odd numbered on the others. A couple of days later, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) threw its weight behind war against air pollution by directing the centre and state government to immediately cease buying of any diesel vehicles for office use.

The Supreme Court (SC) jumped in shortly by imposing a blanket ban on registration of new diesel vehicles engine capacity of over 2000 cc in Delhi till March 31, 2016. Even taxis have been directed to shift to cleaner fuel.

The directives have sent the auto industry, car dealers and prospective buyers into a tizzy. Vehicle makers claim they are being unfairly blamed as the biggest cause of air pollution. Particularly, since the industry has been adhering to the Bharat Stage emission norms implemented regularly and some environmental reports by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) suggest that vehicles are not the highest source of pollutants.

Industry body SIAM feels a better solution would have been to stop older vehicles from plying than barring new registrations. The abrupt implementation of such directives is detrimental to the industry, feels SIAM.

Auto dealers, the biggest victims of this directive are clueless on the way forward. They are stuck with huge inventories of diesel vehicles and redirecting the sales to other smaller markets would be financially unviable due to logistic constraints and price reduction hit that would be needed to sell there.

Pawan Goenka, Executive Director of Mahindra and Mahindra stated that while Delhi’s’ air quality had worsened and that the government needed to take immediate steps to rectify the situation, he was unhappy about the arbitrary manner in which the decision was taken. “Delhi residents, auto companies and dealers will have to endure some pain”, he said, adding the IIT report on pollution needs to be released in public and studied.

However, Sunita Narain of Centre for Science and Environment counters all the allegations stating that placing the spotlight on the auto industry is not without reason. “Diesel vehicles emit seven times more particulate matter (PM) than the petrol versions”, she states, adding that the industry is well aware that even if its BS iV compliant, a diesel vehicle is far too worse than a petrol variant.

While stock analysts are busy assessing the impact of these directives, M&M which was expected to be the worst hit due to 98 percent of its products being diesel-based, has already moved the next step and launched its first petrol SUV.

This hints at a possibility that manufacturers will now start considering the various alternates available. The government’s initiatives in providing incentives for manufacture of electric vehicles might also see good response.

“Our new SUV, KUV 100 will meet the sub-2000cc threshold laid out by SC”, Goenka said at the launch, adding that current situation has actually created an opportunity for the company to scale up its electric portfolio. He also seemed hopeful that the government will work towards creating availability of other cleaner bio-diesel fuels that are less polluting.

Industry watchers feel the SC ruling will make prospective car buyers wary of buying diesel cars as there could be similar bans in other states as well in future.

Broking firm JM Financial feels the Delhi ruling will have negative as well as positive implications.

""While we see a limited impact of this ban in near term, over a medium-long term, heightened concerns on pollution will lead to a) increasing cost as manufacturers invest more on developing and implementing fuel efficient power plants/technologies (driven by changing consumer preferences and regulatory changes), b) greater effort in diversifying the engine range to work with alternate fuels (for Mahindra, introduction of gasoline/CNG models), and c) greater thrust on development of smaller, highly efficient engines using super chargers and turbo chargers"", says a note by JM Financial to clients."

Moneycontrol Bureau

Analysts are positive on the Tech Mahindra and M&M joint deal to acquire Italian automotive design company Pininfarina for about euro 53 million. A special purpose vehicle (SPV) is created by both the Mahindra companies with Tech Mahindra holding 60 percent stake in it.However, questions are raised about Tech Mahindra’s involvement in the deal. Though Credit Suisse has an outperform rating on Tech Mahindra, it is concerned whether M&M’s requirements are driving this acquisition decision to some extent. As per its estimates, the deal is likely to have slightly dilutive impact on Tech Mahindra's EPS (less than 1 percent), given Pininfarina is making losses at PAT level. Tech Mahindra had net cash of USD 400 million as at 30 September 2015.

Credit Suisse thinks Tech Mahindra’s involvement is somewhat of a surprise. ""It is not clear if Tech Mahindra always intended to be a party to this acquisition. Tech Mahindra had earlier also participated in the payment bank license for the group though the investment there was quite small. Tech Mahindra is one of our top picks in the sector given the prospects of telecom business bottoming out, possibility of margin expansion and attractive valuation,” it says in a note.

Deutsche Bank has buy rating on both Tech Mahindra and M&M with target price of Rs 543 and Rs 1500 per share respectively.

""While the deal metrics appear high, we note that that M&M is acquiring the company to enhance its future product launch pipeline through the design and engineering capabilities of Pininfarina. M&M’s cash outflow for the acquisition would be at Euro 21 million. This compares with its annual net profit of Rs 3000 crore and net cash of Rs 100 crore at the end of FY15,"" it says.

Deutsche Bank feels the acquisition would complement Tech Mahindra's existing engineering capabilities and would allow them to pursue a larger market pie.

However, though Kotak has a add rating on Tech Mahindra with a target price of Rs 630 per share but thinks Pininfarina acquisition is not the best buy decision for the IT company.

Kotak says that it would have been better if Tech Mahindra had put its cash to acquire capabilities in the digital or financial services domain, instead. ""This acquisition, although small, combined with recent foray into payments bank is not an optimum utilization of cash in our view,"" it adds.

Kotak also says that Tech Mahindra needs to be prudent on cash management or else it will risk losing investor confidence in capital allocation decisions. ""Delays in deal closures would work against Tech Mahindra in the short term; else we like Teh Mahindra’s leadership in the telecom vertical and solid positioning in the manufacturing vertical. Valuations are inexpensive and risk reward is attractive,"" it elaborates. Pininfarina provides engineering design services and some spares to automakers such as BMW, Ferrari, Peugot, Fiat, GM, Alfa Romeo and Maserati. It has been loss-making for past few years has undergone debt restructurings.At 11:50 hrs Mahindra and Mahindra was at Rs 1,292.50, up Rs 5.50, or 0.43 percent while Tech Mahindra was at Rs 533.15, down Rs 9.55, or 1.76 percent on the BSE.Posted by Nasrin SultanaFollow @NasrinzStory"

Mahindra & Mahindra is close to signing a deal to buy Italian car designer Pininfarina, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday, the latest purchase of an iconic Italian brand by an Asian company.

The terms of the deal have been agreed by both parties after months of talks and an announcement could come as soon as next week, the sources said.

""It's just a matter of putting a stamp on a contract,"" one of the sources said.

Pininfarina declined to comment while Mahindra & Mahindra was not immediately available for comment.

Milan-listed Pininfarina has designed cars for Ferrari, Maserati, Rolls-Royce and Cadillac. Its shares closed down nearly 10 percent on Thursday after daily MF reported that there were growing doubts over the success of the talks.

Mahindra first approached Pininfarina at the beginning of this year but its link to Pininfarina goes back to 2013 when the Indian company hired Hubert Tassin, a former Pininfarina designer.

As part of the agreement, Mahindra will inject about 150 million euros (USD 165 million) in the business to refinance its debt and provide fresh capital for investments, one of the sources said.

Pininfarina had net debt of 47.4 million euros at the end of September.

One of the sources said Mahindra has a plan to support Pininfarina's recovery and while covering its debt it will also invest in new products and technologies.

Turin-based Pininfarina, which owes its name to a nickname of its founder Battista Farina, also called ""Pinin"" Farina, is the latest Italian industrial brand to be snapped up by an Asian buyer after China National Chemical Corp agreed to buy into tyre-maker Pirelli in a 7.3 billion euro deal in March.

Pininfarina - which also designs buildings, interiors, furniture and electronics, among others - has been loss-making for years and its debt is almost equal to its market value of 126 million euros.

The company has been struggling to stay afloat as carmakers have moved to hire more in-house stylists at the expense of independent design firms.

Mahindra has earned a reputation for buying distressed, undervalued companies, analysts said. In 2010, it bought troubled South Korean automaker Ssangyong Motor and last year it acquired a majority stake in France-based Peugeot's loss-making scooter business."

Research firm Morgan Stanley, whose India equity research is headed by noted analyst Ridham Desai, has added Coffee Day Enterprises (parent of coffee chain CCD), M&M and HCL Tech to its focus list and sector model portfolio. The three stocks came in into the portfolio at the expense of Bharat Forge, Dr Reddy's and Maruti Suzuki.In a note, the research house said it expects both urban and rural consumption to pick up pace in the coming months and CCD and M&M were plays on each.It explained the rationale behind the three stock picks as below:CCD: Largest chain of cafés in IndiaCCD operates a highly optimized and vertically integrated coffee business. In addition, CCD has invested in select non-coffee businesses that are essentially opportunistic entrepreneurial ventures. CCD runs the largest chain of cafés in India under the Café Coffee Day brand. Its dominance can be gauged by the café footprint, which is ~4x that of the next four competitors combined. Revenue in thecafé business is low (Rs 13,400 per café per day in F15) and is not sufficient to absorb costs, including depreciation.This is the key reason for the low operating profit. We forecast same store sales growth higher than cost inflation. M&M: Tractors at low end of the cycleGiven two consecutive below-average monsoons, weakness in commodity prices and a slowdown in rural development spend, the tractor industry is now close to -1 standard deviation.We expect a normalized growth rate of 8 percent in FY17. Despite launching the new TUV300, M&M's stock has been flat, and the Street is skeptical about M&M’s success in future UV launches.Expectations for the company are low; thus, we believe it could surprise on the upside, as the new S101 is tapping into new segments (urban), and the M&M UV portfolio will likely benefit from a recovery in consumer discretionary. At 11.5x core F2017E P/E and a 20.5 percent F2016-18E earnings CAGR, downside risks are limited, in our view, but a volume recovery either in tractors or UVs could see thestock rerated and thus it offers attractive potential upside. HCL Tech – Likely robust growth in 2HFY16HCL Tech’s revenue growth has not been inspiring recently. We believe some of this may be attributable to the changein deal scopes as the mix of complex and transformational engagement increases.The deal win run rate remains strong at USD 1 billion per quarter,and the company expects to show robust growth in 2HFY16, in line with or better than the average for the top three Indian IT companies in FY16. Valuations are attractive, with the stock trading at 14xFY17e P/E, cheaper than some of its large Indian peers.In its sector portfolio, Morgan Stanley is overweight consumer discretionary, energy, financials, industrials and technology, neutral utilities, and underweight consumer staples, materials, telecoms and healthcare."

Maruti Suzuki’s November auto sales came in-line with expectations with a 9.7 percent growth year-on-year (YoY). The company sold 1,20,824 vehicles in the month of November. Ashwin Patil, research analyst at LKP Securities says that Maruti’s sales were aided by success of its recently launched Baleno. Compared to last year’s sales, when the festive season for spread over October-November, last month’s sales were not a complete wash-out, he says. LKP Securities maintains its buy rating on the stock, he says adding that 12-13 percent growth is expected for Maruti in FY16. December will not be great in terms of sales, but Q4 is expected to be much better, he adds. For M&M, sale of TUV300 in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) segment helped sales, Patil says. The company’s total sales grew 21 percent YoY. The 42 percent growth in its farm equipments was largely due to expectations of good Rabi season, he adds. Patil expects an 18-20 percent sales growth in MHCV segment for Ashok Leyland.

Homegrown auto major Tata Motors will launch its new compact car Zica early next year as part of its drive to enhance position in the passenger vehicles segment. Engineered on a new platform, the new model is expected to be available in both petrol and diesel engine options. While the company did not comment on the date of launch of Zica, sources said it is expected to hit the market in the early part of 2016.

Zica will add to Tata Motors' new model line up -- Zest and Bolt -- in its passenger cars portfolio besides the previous generation cars Indica Vista and the Indigo along with the new Nano. In January this year, the company launched its new hatchback Bolt. In August last year, it had launched Zest compact sedan, its first new model in four years.

Previously, the company had announced that it would launch two new models every year till 2020 to ramp up its product portfolio in the Indian market. Tata Motors had fallen behind the likes of Honda, Toyota and Mahindra & Mahindra in the Indian passenger vehicles market from being the third largest player at one point of time as its products, including the Nano, failed to deliver. It is banking on new products to revive its fortunes."

""When you want to build a consumer product, test markets and mitigate risks, it makes sense to be very proximate to your ultimate market,"" said Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, a multinational with a wide range of businesses, spanning from aerospace, finance, and defense. Its automobile arm-Mahindra and Mahindra-is currently one of the largest tractor manufacturers in the world.

""Digital technology and things like 3D printing are enabling even more localized manufacturing. I want to make sure that India is ready for that future,"" the 60-year old tycoon told CNBC.

The idea of peer-to-peer resources resulting in more personalized production harmonizes well with the holistic economic principles of Mahatma Gandhi, India`s founding father, where every village becomes a self-supporting and self-contained unit, Mahindra explained.

""If we want to prevent a mass migration and avoid the problems China`s suffered, we should enable a number of small scale units with new digital technology and connect it via the cloud to markets.""

New Delhi policymakers are aggressively spearheading an initiative to transform India into a global manufacturing powerhouse - a field dominated by China over the past three decades. Make in India, the centerpiece of the government`s drive, was introduced last year and Modi has since embarked on an international tour to get international business leaders on board.

""I just want to make sure that India doesn`t get left behind focusing on the old model of `Make in India` while the rest of the world moves in at warp speed in this new era,"" Mahindra noted, referring to his innovative ideas of digital technology.

So where does the Mahindra Group`s massive productions scale and different verticals fit into the business leader`s vision?

""We are remodeling our group to mirror what society will look like. We will have large enterprises which involve large scale manufacturing and at the same time we are incubating a number of start-ups, which I hope will be in the vanguard of the `small is big` movement.""

But India`s archaic labor laws could make that movement tough to realize.

Asia`s third-largest economy has one of the most rigid labor markets in the world, according to a 2014 World Bank report, with current regulations encouraging firms to stay small instead of hiring more. Modi hopes to carry out a series of structural reforms that would giving companies greater flexibility in hiring and firing workers, measures that experts say will ultimately boost economic growth but they have been met with fierce protest by Indian unions.

""I will not pretend that India is an abundance source already of highly skilled, high tech oriented labor. We have a way to go for that and the government and the private sector have to invest a great amount in skilling them,"" said Mahindra.

But once that happens, he believes Indian labor will be ideally suited for that kind of high tech manufacturing due to the nation`s aptitude for engineering.

""Digital technology and things like 3D printing are enabling even more localized manufacturing. I want to make sure that India is ready for that future,"" the 60-year old tycoon told CNBC.

The idea of peer-to-peer resources resulting in more personalized production harmonizes well with the holistic economic principles of Mahatma Gandhi, India's founding father, where every village becomes a self-supporting and self-contained unit, Mahindra explained.

""If we want to prevent a mass migration and avoid the problems China's suffered, we should enable a number of small scale units with new digital technology and connect it via the cloud to markets.""

New Delhi policymakers are aggressively spearheading an initiative to transform India into a global manufacturing powerhouse - a field dominated by China over the past three decades. Make in India, the centerpiece of the government's drive, was introduced last year and Modi has since embarked on an international tour to get international business leaders on board.

""I just want to make sure that India doesn't get left behind focusing on the old model of 'Make in India' while the rest of the world moves in at warp speed in this new era,"" Mahindra noted, referring to his innovative ideas of digital technology.

So where does the Mahindra Group's massive productions scale and different verticals fit into the business leader's vision?

""We are remodeling our group to mirror what society will look like. We will have large enterprises which involve large scale manufacturing and at the same time we are incubating a number of start-ups, which I hope will be in the vanguard of the 'small is big' movement.""

But India's archaic labor laws could make that movement tough to realize.

Asia's third-largest economy has one of the most rigid labor markets in the world, according to a 2014 World Bank report, with current regulations encouraging firms to stay small instead of hiring more. Modi hopes to carry out a series of structural reforms that would giving companies greater flexibility in hiring and firing workers, measures that experts say will ultimately boost economic growth but they have been met with fierce protest by Indian unions.

""I will not pretend that India is an abundance source already of highly skilled, high tech oriented labor. We have a way to go for that and the government and the private sector have to invest a great amount in skilling them,"" said Mahindra.

But once that happens, he believes Indian labor will be ideally suited for that kind of high tech manufacturing due to the nation's aptitude for engineering."

The month of October this year had the inauspicious shradh paksha followed by the auspicious festive season of navratra. However, the festive navratra season had a larger bearing on the auto sales numbers. We saw passenger car sales like never before. Not only the listed car makers like Maruti Suzuki Tata Motors and the UV maker M&M posted robust growth, but the unlisted players like Honda, Toyota, Ford, Hyundai and Renault too posted a very strong growth. This can be attributed to the new model launches like Maruti Baleno, Renault Kwid, previous month launch of Hyundai Creta, Elite i20/Active, M&M’s dual launches of TUV3oo and Supro. Apart from this, attractive price offerings, lower fuel costs and interest rate cycle moving down the spiral have added further to the festive mood. This has made October the highest ever month of auto sales with growth of 22%. We must also note that this growth has come despite having a high base of last year when both Dashera and Diwali were in October. On the two wheeler front too, except for Bajaj Auto , all the other two wheeler companies posted a double digit growth. MHCV saw slight softening of growth as implementation of BSIV norms in October led to this."

Moody's today assigned lowest investment grade rating, Baa3, to homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra, although with a stable outlook. The declining profitability of its automotive business -- mainly because of the weak performance of its Korea-based subsidiary Ssangyong Motor and the limited geographic diversification of the group's non-IT businesses constrain the ratings, it said. Elaborating on the first time issuer rating to M&M, Moody's Vice-President and Senior Analyst Kaustubh Chaubal said: ""The rating reflects M&M's long track record of operations and, at the same time, its adoption of strong corporate governance practices and a prudent approach to management, as well as its close operational oversight of its group companies"".

The rating takes into account the group's diversified business profile across many areas, including farm equipment, automotive, IT, financial services, hospitality and real estate, Moody's said in a statement. ""Furthermore, M&M's credit profile is supported by its strong financial flexibility across listed but group- controlled companies based on the market value of its investments and which show substantial unrealised value,"" said Chaubal, who is also Moody's lead analyst for M&M. Moody's said the rating also factored M&M's leading market position in India in farm equipment and light commercial vehicle (LCV) goods carriers.

""At the same time, although the group's leading, albeit declining, market position in utility vehicles (UVs) is a strength, increasing competition in the UV segment is a concern,"" it added. The ratings agency further said: ""The stable outlook reflects our expectation that M&M will retain its diversified business profile, while maintaining its leading market position in its core farm equipment and automotive businesses in India."" The outlook also anticipates that the company will preserve its very solid balance sheet and modest financial leverage. An upgrade of M&M's rating will require continued strong operational and financial performance and a further diversification in its businesses, Moody's said.

The Baa3 rating could come under pressure if M&M's business profile weakens because of a sustained loss of market share in its key operating segments of tractors, utility vehicles and light commercial vehicles in India, or if Ssangyong Motors continues to report losses, it said. It could also be under pressure if the company undertakes large debt-funded acquisitions that materially weaken its financial profile, Moody's said."

Angel Broking's report on automobile sectorThe commercial vehicle segment rebounded strongly reporting a double digit growth during the month. The surge was due to a robust 64% growth in the medium & heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) segment. Apart from strong economic growth and improvement in fleet operators profitability, pre buying on account of applicability of new safety norms from October 2015 vroomed the MHCV sales. In contrast, the light commercial vehicle (LCV) segment remained under pressure (saw 16% decline). Deficient rainfall (the year witnessed 14% below normal rains) coupled with moderate growth in minimum support price (MSP)s have dampened the rural sentiments which continued to impact the twowheeler (2W) and tractor segments. Two wheeler sales were flat, while the tractor segment witnessed a steep double digit drop (declined 35%).The passenger vehicle (PV) segment maintained healthy growth (9% growth during the month). Rising income levels due to economic recovery alongwith huge pent up demand (PV industry hardly grew in the last three years) have led to surge in the demand. PV industry growth was led by MNC players Hyundai, Honda and Ford which grew in excess of 20% powered by new launches. Market leader Maruti Suzuki underperformed marginally reporting a mid single digit growth. M&M and Tata Motors lagged the industry reporting a fall in the volumes.

Auto sales data for September 2015 will be announced from October 1, which is expected to be mixed bag. Commercial vehicle makers are likely to report strong sales growth along with modest expansion in passenger vehicles sales but two-wheelers and tractors may disappoint.

Medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) sales volumes should grow 35 percent year-on-year in September as this is the last month before the anti-lock braking system (ABS) become mandatory in India (October 1, 2015 onwards), driving prices higher, says Nomura in its note.

It expects MHCV volume growth to normalise in October-March period of FY16. Ashok Leyland's domestic volumes may increase by 57 percent Y-o-Y while Tata Motors's domestic volumes are likely to increase by around 30 percent during the same period, it says.

For passenger vehicles (PVs), the brokerage forecasts that the industry to sustain a modest around 5 percent year-on-year growth, wherein key players like Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai should deliver stronger growth benefitting from new launches, it feels.

It expects Maruti to report healthy around 9 percent year-on-year growth in domestic volumes, led by strong petrol demand and new launches (S-Cross).

As far as two-wheeler sales is concerned, with monsoon rainfall deficit continuing at around 13 percent to date, rural demand remains weak, it feels.

As well, with the festive season being delayed by around 18 days (starts with Dussehra on October 22, 2015 versus October 4, 2014), Nomura expects overall 2-wheeler industry volumes to fall around 8 percent year-on-year in September.

""We forecast Hero Motocorp’s overall volumes to fall by around 12 percent, while Bajaj Auto's volumes should decline by around 15 percent. We expect 53 percent Y-o-Y volume growth for Royal Enfield as capacity expands and underlying demand remains quite strong,"" it explains company wise two-wheelers sales growth.

Nomura sees a 20 percent declined in Mahindra & Mahindra’s tractor sales volumes Y-o-Y.Posted by Sunil Shankar Matkar"

Welcoming rate cut by RBI, automobile manufacturers on Tuesday said it has come as a ""festival gift"" that would help the struggling sector meet 15-20 percent sales growth during the upcoming festive season. ""This is a festival gift. Traditionally, during the festive season, the auto industry witnesses sales growth of 15-20 percent, which was missed in the last couple of years. This reduction in rate by the RBI has assured that the growth will be achieved,"" Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) Senior Vice President (Marketing and Sales) Rakesh Srivastava told . He said the rate cut gives a ""positive signal"" towards enhancing optimism in the sector, where 65 percent of car sales are financed. A reduction in interest rates will reduce cost of ownership and help the automakers get more customers.

Expressing similar views, Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director Marketing and Sales R S Kalsi said: ""On the whole, it gives a good signal to customers. The market so far has been moving very slowly but with this (rate cut) sentiments will improve. It gives the much-needed boost to the market in the pre-festive season."" Automakers generally expect higher sales during the months of October and November when Durga Puja, Diwali and other festivals are celebrated.

Welcoming the rate cut by RBI, Hero MotoCorp Chairman and MD Pawan Munjal said: ""It has come at an opportune time as it will help in raising customer sentiment during the festival season."" Mahindra & Mahindra President and Chief Executive (Automotive) Pravin Shah said: ""If the entire rate cut is passed on to customers by lending institutions, it will bring momentum in auto sales growth, specially in the small commercial vehicles segment which has been witnessing double digit decline in sales for a long time."" In its fourth bi-monthly monetary policy for the current fiscal, RBI today cut its policy rate from 7.25 percent to 6.75 percent - the lowest in four-and-half years. However, some auto industry players feel that the rates could have been cut further. ""Our anticipation was of higher reduction in interest rates of about 100 bps,"" Srivastava said, adding that for sustained growth and to attract buyers, specially in the price sensitive entry-level segments, lower interest rates are needed so that customers get lower EMIs.

He further said that lower interest rates would also have helped customers who are looking to upgrade with an exchange programme and restructure their EMIs."

Mahindra & Mahindra's rural business portfolio may be impacted by low monsoons this year, that's the word coming in from Group CFO and CIO VS Parthasarathy from the sidelines of the 9th edition of the CII CFO summit.

Furthermore, he believes India is on the right track on ease of doing business and says things are slowly improving.

Below is the edited transcript of the interview.

Q: How is India faring on ease of doing business?

Ease of doing business has always been one of the hallmarks in whatever industry that we have been in. It is slowly improving, it is slowly getting better that is how I would like to put it. There are some steps taken, I would like to welcome many more steps in order to do that. We are seeing that clarity is coming in most of the things.

However, you also must take into account the other part which is now new Companies Act comes.

New Companies Act is bringing in complexity in the sense that nothing is given right now. There are no precedence, so that brings in a little bit but that is good for the long-term vision. So, I see that has an evolution process, some things have becoming easier some things are getting easier and we are in the right path.

Q: Mahindra has two of the core companies that are really impacted by the growth of the economy or auto as well as financial services. In both of those are you beginning to see growth? First if we could talk about auto?

A: In both these things I will very quickly say the rural is starting to come off in terms of block but the monsoon is taking its negative impact so I think in balance it is still paused and poised. We will wait for the festive season to see how far and how fast it takes off. However, I have no doubts sooner than later it will take off.

Q: Given how the monsoons have panned out so far and whatever you know are you expecting a bumper season this festive season or do you think it will be more subdued?

A: As a CFO I always hope for the best but prepared in all cases.

Q: Tech Mahindra has also got payments bank license. What is the plan there? Are you exploring tie-ups right now by when will you finalise them?

A: The tie-ups are already in place. Tech Mahindra along with Mahindra Finance, one with rural reach and the other with technology have come together. So, we have all we need and we are set to go.

Q: You won’t be looking at further tie-up with any banks?

A: That is something Tech Mahindra management and the Tech Mahindra leadership should come in and not me. However, they have got between the jugalbandi of Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Finance. They are at ad aptly represented I suppose in that space.

Q: What are the capex plans for the group this year? Will they be higher than the last year?

A: We have talked about a capex of about Rs 10,000 crore for the next three years – capex plus investment that is what Mahindra & Mahindra has spoken. We don’t change capex plans based on how one season behaves. This is long-term commitments and we are committed to Make in India, digitalising India and being in India and prospering.

Q: How much of that Rs 10,000 crore you have already raised in this fiscal?

A: We don’t need to raise; there is enough profits and cash flows that is there. We can manage most of the money in-house. However, when we need to do it, we have got AAA rating from four agencies so we should be able to raise it in jiffy."

Home grown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is eyeing a good response from the market to its recently launched compact SUV TUV300 on the back of growing demand in the utility vehicle segment. ""In 2011-12, the Utility Vehicles contribution to the passenger vehicle segment was 15 per cent, which rose to 23 per cent in 2014-15. Even though the passenger car segment has remained stable or has even gone down, the trend towards utility vehicles has been gaining ground,"" company's Vice President-Sales Automotive Division-Jyoti Malhotra told reporters here today.

Speaking on the sidelines of launch of the TUV300 in Chandigarh, Malhotra said that as present society is very aspiration-driven and there was growing ""aspirational class"" of customers within our society, who are looking for more features and better quality, yet at the same time ""affordability quotient"" remains their key concern. He also said in the overall market, the growth in the industry is ""being driven by new launches"". ""Available at Mahindra dealerships across India, the TUV300 price starts at Rs 7.12 lakh, ex-showroom Chandigarh for the T4 variant (with top-end variant priced at just over Rs 9 lakh),"" he said. ""The vehicle's inspired by the design of a battle tank, its bold and stylish look, its imposing bumpers, together with lots of features and comfort on the inside, that will make anyone want to own it,"" he said. He also said that the vehicle has got plenty of safety features including toughened high strength steel body, 3rd generation crash-worthy chassis, dual airbags, ABS, Corner Brake Control to maintain driver-intended path during braking while turning. ""We also call it a Tough Utility Vehicle and it already meets the safety features which will come into play for the manufacturers from October 2017,"" Malhotra said, adding TUV300 is powered by the advanced 1.5 litre mHawk80 diesel engine.

He said as the vehicle is inspired by the design of a battle tank, customers will also be given the choice to buy accessories like ""bonnet scoop"" at nominal extra cost that will enhance TUV300's ""bold look"". Among other vehicles, TUV300 will take on the likes of Ford EcoSport and Renault Duster that are priced between Rs 7.88 lakh and Rs 13.54 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). M&M's forte has been in the bigger Utility Vehicles segment, with models such as the Scorpio and XUV500."

Religare's report on Mahindra & MahindraWe attended MM’s TUV300 launch yesterday at the company’s Chakan plant in Pune. Aggressively priced at Rs 690,000 and positioned as a rough-and-tough vehicle, the TUV300 appears better suited for semi-urban/rural markets and is the first of two new compact SUVs expected from MM this year. Launches augur well for MM’s auto segment volumes, but scanty rainfall in most parts of India has cast a pall on the tractor business. We cut estimates to build in lower volumes and revise our Sep’16 TP to Rs 1,330 (from Rs 1,400). Maintain HOLD. TUV300 launch: MM launched the TUV300 in 7 variants including an AMT version with pricing in the range of Rs 690,000 to Rs 912,000 (ex-showroom Pune). Slated as competition for the likes of EcoSport and Duster, the TUV300 will have a 1.5ltr diesel engine, a tank-type build, Scorpio-type chassis and an engine similar to the XUV500 and Scorpio. In all, MM has spent ~Rs 12bn on R&D, designing, tooling and engines. Potential fillip to flagging volumes: MM can currently manufacture ~3,300 TUV300 units a month which will be ramped up to 5,000 vehicles in a month’s time. We believe the vehicle’s rough-and-tough positioning could find more takers in rural and semi-urban markets. MM already dominates the segment with 75%+ share (largely ladder frame products) in its flagship Bolero and Scorpio models. The new launch will likely give a fillip to volumes, but could also cannibalise on Bolero sales.Up next - an urban compact SUV: As planned, MM will launch its next compact SUV codenamed S101 in Nov’15 targeting the urban market. The product will be keenly watched as it too will compete with EcoSport and Duster in the urban SUV category.Earnings tweaked; maintain HOLD: While new launches in the auto segment should aid volume growth, we expect the poor monsoon season to dampen tractor sales. We lower our FY16 and FY17 earnings estimates for MM by 4% each to factor in lower tractor volumes and cut our Sep’16 TP to Rs 1,330. Maintain HOLD, says Religare Retail research report.For all recommendations, click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

The sale of indebted Italian car designer Pininfarina to Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra could be wrapped up in the next couple of weeks, three sources close to the situation said on Tuesday.

Shares in Pininfarina, which has designed cars for Ferrari, Maserati, Rolls-Royce and Cadillac, jumped more than 20 percent before being suspended from trading, while Mahindra was up 3.5 percent by 0955 GMT.

Two of the sources said a meeting with Pininfarina's creditor banks was likely to take place soon, possibly next week. The banks would be offered the option of rescheduling debt repayments to 2025 or of an immediate reimbursement, but for only half the debt owed, one of the sources said.

""The ball is in the court of the Pininfarina banks now,"" one of the sources said.

Another source said the Pininfarina family would keep a small stake in the group and be involved in management of the company after the sale.

An unsourced report in financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore said that within days the two firms, which have been in talks for months, could seal an ""investment agreement"" that would see Mahindra take control of the troubled Italian company.

Spokesmen at Pininfarina and Mahindra declined to comment. Pininfarina's controlling shareholder Pincar, which has a 76 percent stake in the group, said in a statement talks with the Indian group on the sale of its holding were underway and any developments would be communicated to the market in due course.

Turin-based Pininfarina's market capitalisation at Monday's close was 123.6 million euros (USD 138 million).

The company has been loss-making for years and its net debt stood at 52.7 million euros at end-June. It has been struggling to stay in business as carmakers have moved to hire more in-house stylists at the expense of independent design firms."

The plan, a collective vision of the government and industry, also aims to propel the Indian auto sector ""to be the engine of 'Make in India' programme, potentially contributing in excess of 12 per cent of the country's GDP. ""AMP 2026 envisages that the India automotive industry will grow 3.5-4 times in value from its current output of around Rs 4.64 lakh crore to about Rs 16.16-18.89 lakh crore by 2026,"" said a curtain raiser on AMP 2016-26, which was released here at the SIAM annual convention.

Highlighting the significance of the sector, it said: ""Over the next decade, the Indian automotive sector is likely to contribute in excess of 12 per cent of the country's GDP and comprise more than 40 per cent of its manufacturing sector."" On job creation, it said: ""The potential for incremental number of both direct and indirect jobs to be created by the Indian automotive industry over the next decade is nearly 65 million."" This is over and above an additional 25 million jobs created in the previous decade, it added. In terms of exports, the AMP 2016-26 envisages Rs 2.95 lakh crore from OEMs and Rs 4.62 lakh crore from component shipments. On emission norms, the plan said there is a need for a scientific and transparent study of the causes of air pollution in Indian cities, suggesting BS V by 2019 for new models and BS VI by 2023 for four-wheelers.

On safety regulations, it said the there is a need for articulating a clear road map over the next decade that will make Indian vehicles comply with global standards. About AMP 2016-26, SIAM past president and Mahindra and Mahindra Executive Director Pawan Goenka said: ""We believe that AMP 2026 has visionary targets. It goes beyond just numbers and focuses on promoting safe, efficient and comfortable mobility for every person in society."" SIAM President Vikram Kirloskar said: ""Once we have a road map, its easy to go and use this for all policy purposes for a long time."" In the first AMP 2006-16, the auto industry had achieved a target of incremental job creation of 25 million while the country attracted investments topping the target of Rs 1.55 lakh crore from global and local OEMs as well as component makers."

Moneycontrol Bureau

Auto sales data for August will be announced on Tuesday (September 1), which is expected to be strong on MHCV and PV front.

Strong growth in medium & heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) space may be led by pre buying ahead of mandatory ABS (anti-lock braking system) implementation from October 1, 2015. With ABS and speed controllers to be mandatory, truck prices may rise 2-3 percent October onwards, say experts.

Nomura expects 5-6 percent growth for passenger vehicles in August and Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai & Honda may deliver strong growth whereas 2-wheeler industry volumes may decline 2-3 percent as rural sales may remain under pressure.

Given improved domestic demand and success of new launches like Ciaz, Celerio and Alto Automatic, Maruti is expected to report 9.2 percent growth in August sales at 1.21 lakh units compared to year-ago period, said the brokerage in its note. Domestic sales may grow 11.9 percent while exports are likely to fall 12 percent.

Ashok Leyland, the country's second largest commercial vehicle maker, is seen reporting a whopping 35.2 percent growth at 11,200 units in the month gone by year-on-year, boosted by pre buying demand ahead of ABS norms becoming mandatory from October 1. Nomura expect MHCV sales to rise 54.2 percent but light commercial vehicle sales may decline 10 percent during the same period.

Bajaj Auto's sales may decline half a percent during the month at 3.35 lakh units against 3.36 lakh units sold in same period last year.

Mahindra & Mahindra's overall sales volumes may be largely flattish while tractors are likely to see decline. Nomura expects total sales degrowth of 2.6 percent year-on-year at 48,650 units while tractor sales may fall 10 percent to 13,500 units.

The brokerage says Tata Motors' total sales may largely remain unchanged at 41,000 units. MHCV sales may grow 33 percent to 14,000 units but passenger vehicles sales may slip 3 percent to 11,000 units."

A compact sub-four metre SUV, M&M is positioning the TUV300 as a ""a true blue SUV"" and is expected to compete with the likes of Toyota Etios Cross, Hyundai 120 Active and Fiat Avventura which are priced at a range of Rs 6.23 lakh and Rs 8.89 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). The company is targeting to address needs of those customers who are looking for a pure SUV in the compact segment, which at present is dominated by crossover models.

M&M had introduced a compact SUV Quanto in 2012 but it did not meet with the success that other models from the company such as the XUV500 and Scorpio had. The design of the Mahindra TUV300 has been inspired by a battle tank with raised shoulders, high front nose, flat roof, high ground clearance and straight bonnet, the company said. The TUV300 is an all-new SUV platform.

It has been designed and developed in-house by the Mahindra design team. The research and development of Mahindra TUV300 has been carried out at the Mahindra Research Valley in Chennai, the company said. The vehicle will be manufactured at the company's manufacturing facility at Chakan, where it also produces trucks and other vehicles of Maxximo platform."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Mahindra and MahindraM&M’s results were better than expected as its EBITDA margins surprised positively. This was attributable to lower commodity costs and a better product mix. While M&M’s EBITDA declined 1.3% YoY to Rs12.5bn, EBITDA margin at 12.7% was ahead of expectation. This was slightly set off against a higher‐than‐expected tax rate, but the overall decline at 3.4% to Rs8.5bn was better than expectations.

M&M’s Q1 results were better than expected as cost control, product mix improvement and benign input cost environment benefited the company. In the event of a decent Kharif crop, YoY growth is likely to resume from Nov 2015 in the tractor segment. New UV launches are highly anticipated and should help trigger an improvement in the automotive division performance. While both UVs and tractors come off a lower base, their recovery would be based upon differing triggers pertinent to urban and rural customers, respectively. FY17 should mark a better performance from both these segments though. Thus, the long‐term outlook for M&M remains good due to need for agri‐mechanisation, new launches in UV1 segment in FY16, recovery in CV cycle etc.

At the current market price, the stock is trading at 22.1x FY16E and 17.6x FY17E standalone earnings. Our target of Rs1,473 is based upon a core target PE of 12.5x FY17e (Rs886) and value of investments and subsidiaries at Rs587. We maintain ‘Accumulate’, says Prabhudas Lilladher research.

M&M’s volumes continued to be under pressure in Q1FY16. Total volumes declined 8.1% YoY, with automotive division volumes being lower 2.7% YoY and tractor division volumes being lower 16.4% YoY. Total revenues declined by 3.4% YoY to Rs98.3bn: 8.1% YoY volume decline, 5.6% YoY improvement in realisations and 26.2% YoY decline in other operating income,says Prabhudas Lilladher research.

Mahindra and Mahindra will launch more products in the October-March period of this fiscal to fight volatility in the sector, its chairman Anand Mahindra said on Friday. ""We are confident that with the products we have in the pipeline, our power to spring back resiliently remains intact and you will see it being unleashed in the second half of this year,"" he told shareholders at the annual general meeting of the company here. Dwelling strongly on the importance of resilience, Mahindra compared the flagship company of the group with the bamboo, saying it has shown the same characteristics in the face of difficulties witnessed through the year.

He said the auto sales slipped by 10 percent in the final quarter of the fiscal and sales in the high-margin tractor segment plummeted by 30 percent, which was last seen in the third quarter of 2009, when the company posted a profit of only Rs 1 crore. ""This time around, in spite of double the volume drop for tractors - in fact, the largest volume drop in a decade, we still generated a profit after tax for the quarter of Rs 617 crore after adjusting exceptional and one-time items and an operating profit margin of 11.8 percent,"" he said. This was possible on the back of right measures to protect revenue and profit, he said. Mahindra said in 2014-15, half of the top 10 original equipment manufacturers in the auto industry in the country have registered a decline due to weak demand across the globe. Additionally, in the tractor industry where the group has a sizable presence, all the states in the country except one, had drop in growth. The company today reported a 3.35 percent slide in standalone net profit at Rs 852.2 crore for the three months through June, hurt by slowdown in overall sales and warned that tractor sales will continue to be under strain in the second quarter as well.

""I don't see the farm equipment business picking up in the September quarter as well. Our tractor sales degrew 12 percent in July and I expect sales degrowth to continue in the remaining months of quarter 2. But with a better-than-expected monsoons, I see some pick up from October and hopes to close the year with around 6 percent growth,"" executive director and head of automotive business Pawan Goenka said.

The company scrip shed 0.47 percent to close at Rs 1,387.65 apiece on the BSE, as against the 0.22 percent correction in the benchmark. Shareholders at the AGM also paid homage to former President A P J Abdul Kalam by observing silence."

"August 07, 2015 09:15 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/gap-down-opening-seen-for-niftyweak-global-cues-1449121.html,"The Indian equity market is expected to open with a gap down opening today. The SGX Nifty, an indicator of the market opening, is trading at 8577.50, down 36 points at 7:20.

The bulls maintained momentum on Dalal Street on Thursday. After a sluggish day, the market geared up to rally at end. The Sensex was up 75.05 points or 0.3 percent at 28298.13 and the Nifty ended up 20.70 points or 0.2 percent at 8588.65.

Global markets, meanwhile, are in the red with US stocks closing lower on Thursday, with the Nasdaq off 1.6 percent, as investors weighed declines in oil and disappointing earnings ahead of Friday's key employment report. Economists expect 223,000 non-farm payrolls on Friday with unemployment unchanged at 5.3 percent, according to a Reuters poll.

Asian markets, too opened weak, taking the lead from the US markets. The decline in oil prices and disappointing earnings ahead of key employment report today weighed on sentiment. Investors in Asia keep an eye on the Bank of Japan's policy decision.

And in Europe, stocks closed largely lower yesterday, as crude prices hit fresh lows and the Bank of England held its key interest rate unchanged.

In other asset classes, Crude continued to decline with Nymex Crude settling at multi-month lows as a large drop in US crude inventories failed to boost prices. Brent crude was trading below USD 50 per barrel.

The dollar retreated against major currencies in choppy trading in a week that has seen the greenback on a generally firmer trend, as investors balanced their positions ahead of the crucial US nonfarm payrolls report.

And from the precious metals space, gold edged higher, supported by the retreating US dollar and a tumble in global equities as traders awaited US employment data seen as key to determining when the Federal Reserve may raise interest hikes.

Back home, two auto majors are in focus today ahead of their earnings. Tata Motors is expected to post a weak quarter as analysts expect JLR sales to disappoint once again. A tepid set of Q1 numbers are expected from Mahindra and Mahindra as well. Analysts keep an eye on falling volumes in the auto as well as the tractor segment.

And on the macro front, the Finance Minister is not giving up hope on GST and the April 2016 deadline despite the parliament standoff. He said the ball is still in the states' court when it comes to the land bill."

Troubled Italian car designer Pininfarina is still hoping to clinch a sale to Indian vehicle maker Mahindra and Mahindra but has begun drafting a stand-alone business plan as its financial position worsens.



Pininfarina forecast on Thursday a full-year operating loss and said it did not expect to be able to meet at the end of the year a target for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation agreed with creditors as part of its debt restructuring.



""Although it hopes for a positive outcome of ongoing talks (with Mahindra), the board is working on new standalone business and financial plan more in line with the group's current ability to generate cash to repay its debt,"" the company said in a statement.



The group famous for designing Ferraris such as the Testarossa said it expected to present the new plan to creditor banks in the last quarter of the year.



Pininfarina's controlling shareholder Pincar and banking creditors failed to agree a sale of the indebted group to Mahindra this month, sources close to the matter said this week.



Talks would resume in September but one source said Mahindra was ""very cautious"" and wanted to invest in Pininfarina ""at the lowest possible price"".



On Thursday, Pininfarina reported a first-half net loss of 4.4 million euros, in line with the previous year, and said its net debt stood at 52.7 million euros at the end of June up from 44.8 million euros at the end of December."

Homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra will launch its new compact SUV named TUV300 in mid September as it looks to enhance its position as a leading manufacturer of utility vehicles in India. ""The TUV300 is a compact sub-four metre SUV. This will be a true blue SUV and not a crossover that is mainly the case in the market now,"" M&M Executive Director Pawan Goenka told PTI.

While he did not comment on the details of the product, he said: ""This new vehicle will address the needs of those customers who are looking for a pure SUV in the compact segment. We will share the details of the product around the time of launch in mid-September."" The TUV300 is expected to compete with the likes of Toyota Etios Cross, Hyundai 120 Active and Fiat Avventura which are priced at a range of Rs 6.23 lakh and Rs 8.89 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). M&M had introduced a compact SUV Quanto in 2012 but it did not meet with the success that other models from the company such as the XUV500 and Scorpio had.

The design of the Mahindra TUV300 has been inspired by a battle tank with raised shoulders, high front nose, flat roof, high ground clearance and straight bonnet, the company said. On the significance of the model, Goenka said: Today, Mahindra has the strongest equity in the SUV segment in India. In our ongoing automotive journey, we identified a need for a tough, bold and masculine SUV and our customer clinics have confirmed that the TUV300 delivers on these parameters.

The TUV300 is an all new SUV platform. It has been designed and developed in-house by the Mahindra design team. The research and development of Mahindra TUV300 has been carried out at the Mahindra Research Valley in Chennai, the company added.

M&M President & Chief Executive, (Automotive) Pravin Shah said the vehicle will be manufactured at the company's manufacturing facility Chakan in Maharashtra."

Talks on the sale of indebted Italian car designer Pininfarina to Indian vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra will resume after the summer after the parties failed to strike a deal in July, two sources close to the matter said on Tuesday.



The key investor in Pininfarina and the group's creditor banks are still seeking to agree a sale but Mahindra is ""very cautious and plans to invest in Pininfarina at the lowest possible price"", one of the sources said.



Earlier this month sources had said Pininfarina and Mahindra were trying to reach a deal by the end of July.



Pininfarina, which designed Ferraris such as the Dino and the Testarossa, is hard pressed for time. Its operating loss more than doubled in the first quarter from a year earlier.



It expects to post a 2015 operating loss and sees net debt at the end of December above the previous year's level.



It said in May that it would struggle to meet targets set by creditors for this year's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).



However, Pininfarina's controlling shareholder Pincar - which has a 76 percent stake in the group - and the creditor banks are keen to keep the company going even if a new debt restructuring may be needed, the sources said.



Pininfarina, which owes around 100 million euros to a group of banks, already restructured its debt in 2009 and 2012.



One obstacle to a potential deal was removed in recent weeks through the decision by an Italian court to uphold a ruling which rejected a labour dispute that could have forced Pininfarina to hire 900 former employees of now bankrupt car manufacturing group De Tomaso.



An Italian court's ruling that rejected a labour dispute that could have forced Pininfarina to hire 900 people in recent weeks removed an obstacle to a possible deal.



Pininfarina had sold in 2009 some industrial operations to now bankrupt car manufacturer De Tomaso, including 900 workers who had challenged the sale in court.



Mahindra, Pininfarina and the main creditor banks, Intesa Sanpaolo and UniCredit declined to comment."

Korean auto major Hyundai on Thursday said it has received over 10,000 pre-bookings for its upcoming mass market sports utility vehicle Creta, which is all set to debut in India on July 21.

The company's Indian arm, Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL), has invested Rs 1,000 crore in the development of the five-seater model. It will compete with the likes of Mahindra & Mahindra, Renault, Nissan, Ford and Tata Motors in the volume segment of SUVs.

""Creta has created immense excitement even before its launch with its bold and stylish looks. We are delighted to receive an overwhelming response with over 28,500 enquiries and 10,000 customers showing their interest to live the Creta life,"" HMIL Senior Vice President - Sales & Marketing, Rakesh Srivastava, said in a statement.

The SUV will herald a new chapter in Hyundai Motor India's success story and will set a new benchmark in the SUV segment of India with it's unmatched capabilities, he added.

Hyundai Creta will compete with the offerings, including Ford Ecosport, Renault Duster, Nissan Terrano and Mahindra Scorpio, Mahindra XUV500 and Tata Safari Storme, which are in a price range of Rs 6.75 lakh to Rs 15.99 lakh.

With Creta, Hyundai is entering the full-fledged volume segment of SUVs. As of now, Hyundai is present in the SUV segment in the premium category with Santa Fe and with sports-styled i20 Active.

The SUV segment has been growing in India since 2013 at an annual rate of 25 per cent but it has declined in the January-May period by about 6 per cent.

The Creta has been designed and developed in Korea, while HMIL engineers in Hyderabad and Chennai helped to customise it for the Indian conditions."

Abhay Laijawala, Deutsche Bank said with the anxiety over Greece and China ebbing, expectations of a Fed liftoff will be back on the table for financial markets. With the FOMC meeting scheduled for September, the market will start to price in a lift-off then, unless some counter factors emerge, he added.

US economics team believes that US Fed is on track for a September liftoff, he said.

According to him, the Fed liftoff may emerge as the most significant event for emerging market liquidity. Over past 2-3 years, there has been a generally negative correlation between US 10-year bond yield and MSCI EM/MSCI India, implying that periods of rising US bond yields have led to an environment of subdued foreign inflows for emerging markets (EM), said Laijawala in its note.

He believes India will outperform amid impaired environment of FII flows.

""While India will not stay immune to any FOMC liftoff induced suppressed inflows for emerging markets, India will be relatively less impacted as the EM differentiation – which started about one and a half years ago - is likely to intensify further as global commodity deflation becomes more entrenched. In addition, the perception of EM currency stability and willingness/ability of respective governments to engineer a domestic turnaround – within a volatile global environment - will also be further factors of differentiation,"" he reasoned.

While foreign portfolio inflows stay subdued, and domestic portfolio investors remain key drivers of market liquidity, mid caps are likely to outperform more meaningfully in the run up to the Fed liftoff, he believes. His top mid cap picks are Apollo Tyres, IRB Infra, Castrol, Cummins, HPCL, Ashok Leyland and Bajaj Finserv.

According to him, commodity deflation will get entrenched, which is further strengthening the case for public investment in India.

He feels a strengthening USD, slowing China and the recent Iran nuclear deal are all pointing towards a lower for longer commodity price environment. By virtue of its net commodity importer status (oil, coal, gold, silver and fertilizers account for around 40 percent of India’s merchandise imports), India stands out relative to its EM peers.

Laijawala said a prolonged period of commodity deflation can provide additional fiscal manoeuvrability to the government of India to ramp up vital public investments without exerting much pressure on fiscal balance. The environment for public investment has not been as conducive as it is currently, he feels.

Direct beneficiaries of commodity deflation include HPCL, BPCL, Apollo Tyres, Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra.

He said at the brokerage, they have trimmed the weight of financials from 124 basis points to 69 basis points in the Deutsche Bank India model portfolio.

According to him, in the run up to the Fed liftoff in September, RBI may choose to put rupee over rates as its focus area. Unless FII limits on treasury bonds are eased 10-year bond yields are likely to stay elevated, he said.

He added that the brokerage maintained IT services as a key underweight sector as it believes that cross-currency headwinds will continue to be a challenge for the sector at least until the Fed liftoff.

Its key overweight remained unchanged with industrials remaining highest overweight at 354 bps (against 337 bps earlier). He suggested that investors should position their portfolios in line with shift in government’s policy focus on public investments and infra-creating assets.

Laijawala said energy remained key overweight driven by Coal India, HPCL and BPCL. ""We have introduced Castrol and Apollo Tyres (beneficiaries of lower oil price) into the model portfolio, while Tata Motors exits the portfolio due to weakening demand environment in China. Our top large cap picks are: BPCL, Axis Bank, M&M, HDFC Bank, UltraTech, Maruti, Zee, Container Corporation, Bharti, L&T and Coal India,"" he added."

"July 09, 2015 04:07 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/whats-in-a-name-registrationsurnames-as-trademark-1429515.html,"Starting of a business in the name of surname or personal name is not a very new concept in India. Numerous people have been using their surname with their business to associate their identity with it. But as the number of business and the plurality of same surname are increasing the association has lost its purpose and often leads to confusion. Thus if one has got uncommon and rare surname, then he might think to use it as trademark. However the major risk associated with registration of surname as a trademark is its protection. One may register it, but cannot claim exclusive right over the mark and stop others from using it (which is the ultimate purpose of registration of a trademark).

Legal Standing

The Trademark and Merchandise Act, 1958 under clause (d) of section 9 refused the registration of surname as trademark. However, the new Act1 has no provision to allow or disallow the use of surname of personal names. The definition of the ""mark"" doesn't explicitly include or exclude surnames and personal names. Thus it is assumed that such registration is allowed, and hence, even applied for.

Position of trademarks regarding surnames in India-

Where the word propounded for registration has no significance other than being a surname, then it may not be registered unless proof of distinctiveness is shown. This is done as no differentiation can be made among the goods of proprietors of same names.

Where the word propounded for registration has a ""better known"" meaning attached to it other than being a simple surname for example 'Ms. Rachel Green', then it is may be registered even if no proof of distinctiveness is shown.

Though the protection of surnames as trademark is difficult, yet we are surrounded by surnames as registered trademarks. Tata, Bajaj, Honda, Ford, Ralph Lauren, Suzuki, Goenka, Mahindra and Mahindra, Sony, Ranbaxy (derived from Ranbir Singh and Gurbax Singh), Dabur (derived from Dr. Burman), Aditya Birla Group, Procter and Gamble, Johnson and Johnson, HP, Dell are few examples from the long list of such marks which exists across the globe. Few marks like Tata, Honda, Dr. Reddy's Laboratory, Philips, Mahindra and Mahindra have also acquired ""well known"" trademark status under the Act2.

The concept can be understood more clearly with the assistance of few cases decided by the Hon'ble courts in India. These cases highlight the two situations where the court has held:-

That the same or similar to the registered trademark is used with mala-fide intention and thus amounts to infringement or passing off. In these cases, the trademark was said to be hit by the provisions of Section 9 of the Act which talks about the absolute grounds of refusal.

Mahindra and Mahindra v Mahendra and Mahendra

An infringement suit was filed by Mahindra and Mahindra (plaintiff) against Mahendra and Mahendra Seeds Pvt Ltd (defendant) for using a deceptively similar mark. The Court decided the matter in favour of the plaintiff and observed that though the word ""Mahindra"" is a common surname in India, the plaintiff had acquired distinctiveness and secondary meaning of the word ""Mahindra"" with its continuous use and if used by the defendant even in regard to different field of activity, it would surely result in creating confusion in the public mind that it belongs to the plaintiff.3

Dr. Reddy Laboratories v Reddy Pharmaceuticals4

In the present suit, the Plaintiff Company which manufactured its products under the trademark ""Dr. Reddy's"" was engaged in the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products for the last over 19 years and even had overseas operations. The defendant contented that the plaintiff cannot claim any monopolist and proprietary right in a common surname such as ""Reddy"" and the defendant has a bona fide statutory right to use the same as it is the surname as of its Managing Director.

The court observed that the drugs and pharmaceutical preparations manufactured by the plaintiff have earned enormous trade reputation and goodwill and plaintiff is distinctively identified and associated with trade mark/name ""Dr. Reddy"" as well as their logo. The Court also stated that the defendant had adopted the trade mark ""Reddy"" on its pharmaceutical preparations to encash upon the trade reputation and goodwill of the plaintiff Company. The use of Trade Mark/name ""Reddy"" by defendant on its pharmaceutical preparations is neither concurrent nor honest.

That the use of name same or similar to the registered name is honest and concurrent (under section 12) as the name (surname) is common in India and no one can claim exclusive rights over it.

Prathibha Singh v Singh and Associates5

The Plaintiff contended that she coined the mark ""Singh & Singh"" in the year 1997 when she started independent practice of providing legal services and has been continuously using the said mark since then and the said mark has acquired a secondary meaning in reference to the plaintiff, especially in the field of Intellectual Property law. The mark was registered in the year 2005. The plaintiff came to know about another law firm named ""Singh and Associates"" practising in IPR laws only. The plaintiff learnt that the Advocates working in the name and style of the defendant were making unsolicited approaches to the foreign associates and clients of the plaintiff in an obvious effort to confuse the plaintiff's clients and divert work to the defendant.

However the Court observed that ""Singh"" is a very common surname in India and no person can claim monopoly over it.

Conclusion

There are a lot of myths associated with the registration of common names and personal names as trademarks. Clearly it can be seen that we are surrounded by the names and they are even effectively protected. The key to protection of such mark is acquired distinctiveness which though cannot guarantee exclusive rights but gives a tough way for others to register the mark. Thus a unique surname can give a business your identity or else you have to build one.

Competition Commission has rejected allegations of unfair business practices made against 18 auto makers, including Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and Ford, with respect to conditions put forward in their dealership agreements.

It was alleged that dealership agreements between automobile manufacturers and authorised dealers are completely one-sided and in favour of auto makers.

The complaint was filed against 18 entities, including Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, Honda Siel Cars India, Volkswagen India, General Motors India, Toyota Kirloskar Motor, Ford India, Renault India and Hyundai Motor India.

Others include Ashok Leyland, Tractor and Farm Equipment, Piaggio Vehicles, Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra Two Wheeler, Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India and TVS Motor Co. Rejecting the complaint, Competition Commission of India (CCI) said there is no prima-facie evidence of violation of competition norms.

The informant, Pondicherry-based K Rajarajan, alleged that terms of the agreement entered into with Mahindra & Mahindra and Bajaj Auto were one-sided and loaded in favour of these two manufacturers only.

In its order, dated June 30 and made public on Friday, CCI said the informant has not been able to even prima facie establish appreciable adverse effect on competition in the market with respect to the impugned terms and conditions contained in the Letter of Intent (LOI) or dealership agreements of the opposite parties.

""Essentially, the grievances of the informant appear to be monetary disputes for which informant has already initiated civil suits and arbitration proceedings before the appropriate authorities,"" it added."

Car maker Maruti Suzuki remains top pick and also likes Tata Motors in the largecap auto space, says brokerage UBS, after auto companies declared their sales data for June.

The brokerage believes Maruti is best placed to capture pent-up demand by a strong new model cycle.

It also believes risk-reward looks attractive for Tata Motors, as it expects Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) volumes growth to move back into double digits from Q3FY15 driven by the ramp-up of the Chery JV plant and new models – Jaguar XE, XF and Discovery Sport.

JLR US sales increased by 10.5 percent in June led by Land Rover sales that grew by 15 percent but Jaguar sales declined 3.6 percent year-on-year.

Overall auto sales in June were still mixed and only trucks segment was strong. There was a mixed trend in passenger vehicles (PV) sales, but UBS remains positive on PV players given stronger urban pent-up demand relative to two wheelers.

Maruti Suzuki's domestic volumes were up 2 percent year-on-year on a high base (primarily in the mini segment); while Hyundai's domestic volumes grew by 8 percent Y-o-Y during June 2015.

Tata Motors' domestic PV volumes rose by 30 percent Y-o-Y, driven by strong growth from new car launches, while utility vehicles continued to be weak. However, M&M's PV volumes declined 15 percent Y-o-Y.

As far as two-wheelers segment is concerned, the brokerage believes executive motorcycles are structurally challenged in urban markets due to substitution from scooters. It thinks mass-market motorcycles (entry + executive) look unlikely to grow faster than 5-6 percent Y-o-Y, even assuming strong rural demand. It expects competitive intensity in motorcycles segment to increase.

Hero Motocorp's volumes were flat on yearly basis, but as per the company, retails are currently better than dispatches. It sold 5.42 lakh units in June 2015 against 5.41 lakh units in the year-ago period.

Honda's domestic 2-wheeler sales volumes rose by 7 percent Y-o-Y due to strong growth in scooters sales that increased by 32 percent Y-o-Y, but motorcycles remained weak, down 21 percent Y-o-Y. TVS Motor's domestic 2-wheeler sales grew by 5 percent during the same period.

Bajaj Auto sold 3.3 lakh units in June, a growth of 8 percent compared to same month last year. Motorcycles sales grew by 10 percent and exports jumped 16 percent.

Eicher Motors' Royal Enfield volumes shot up 48 percent year-on-year.

Medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) sales remained strong in June but tractors were weak. Tata Motors' MHCV sales volumes were up 19 percent Y-o-Y while Ashok Leyland's MHCVs remained strong, showing 46 percent growth Y-o-Y.

Eicher Motors' CV volumes remained weak with only 3 percent growth in domestic volumes and a sharp decline in exports.

Light commercial vehicles (LCV) shipments continued to be weak for Tata Motors, down 18 percent and down 6 percent for M&M while Ashok Leyland's volumes were up 26 percent Y-o-Y. M&M's domestic tractor sales fell by 17 percent during the same period.

The auto sector may not be cruising but neither has it hit the 'brakes' just yet. Be it the country's largest car maker Maruti that has just managed to post a marginal rise in its June numbers, with total sales growing 1.8 percent to come in at 1,14,756 units, compared to 1,12,773 units it sold in the same period last year, or Mahindra and Mahindra, which reported marginal fall in sales at just 36,134 units, versus 38,466 units in the same month last year.

What's surprising is M&M's tractor sales which have beaten expectations to come in at more than 23,500 units.

Tata Motors, meanwhile, had a good month with overall sales growing by 6 percent to come in at 40,870 units as compared to 38,574 units in the same month last year. Domestic sales of Tata Motors' commercial and passenger vehicles stood at 35,823 units in June, showing a growth of 3 percent over 34,760 vehicles sold in June 2014, Tata Motors said in a statement.

But if there's one company that's definitely cruising right now, it has to be Eicher Motors which has posted a growth of close to 50 percent in Royal Enfield sales. The company sold 37,341 motorcycles in June, a whopping growth of 48 percent compared to 25,303 units sold in the year-ago period. The growth was largely aided by models with engine capacity up to 350cc, which showed a 50 percent rise in sales at 33,048 units.

Hinduja Group's flagship company Ashok Leyland comes a close second in terms of sales growth. It reported a 41 percent hike in total sales of commercial vehicles at 10,461 units in June. It had sold 7,411 units in the same period last year.

Another company that posted double digit sales growth is Honda Cars India. It reported a 12.65 percent increase in its domestic sales at 18,380 units in June.

Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) sold 36,300 units last month as compared with 33,514 units in June 2014, up 8.3 percent.

June month is expected to be strong again for medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) segment. Brokerage Nomura expects 24 percent year-on-year sales volume growth in MHCV category. It said 2-wheeler sales growth may be around 5 percent on yearly basis but passenger vehicles (PVs) volume growth may be flattish. Auto companies will announce their June sales data on Wednesday.

""The recent trend of strong growth momentum in MHCVs and steady recovery in the passenger vehicle industry are likely to sustain in June as well. We expect 24 percent Y-o-Y volume growth in MHCVs for PVs, while industry volume growth on a Y-o-Y basis will likely be flattish due to the higher base effect, underlying growth momentum remains strong,"" the brokerage explains in its note.

Passenger vehicle industry volumes had increased by 14 percent Y-o-Y in June-14 due to fears of a roll-back of excise duty benefits (4-6 percent) in the July-15 government Budget.

According to Nomura, higher-tonnage vehicles (more than 25 tonnes) will continue to lead the volume growth recovery in MHCV segment. Volumes in this segment have grown at almost 60 percent Y-o-Y in the first two months of FY16, while lower-tonnage segments have seen 13 percent growth in the same period.

In terms of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the brokerage expects Ashok Leyland’s domestic volumes to increase by 37 percent Y-o-Y (partly due to a lower base) and Tata Motors volumes will likely grow in line with industry growth. Eicher’s domestic volumes will likely increase by around 13 percent Y-o-Y as a lower presence in highertonnage segments is impacting its volume growth, it said.

It feels Maruti Suzuki’s volumes may grow at 3 percent Y-o-Y, again due to a higher base. Its volumes were up 34 percent Y-o-Y in June 2014. The company launched the Celerio diesel in the first week of June, which should help dispatches this month, it said.

For M&M, it expects PV volumes to remain flattish, as a lack of new models and weak rural demand will impact volumes. Tata Motors will likely report 27 percent Y-o-Y volume growth in PVs on the success of its new models and the lower base.

On the other hand, rural volumes continue to remain under pressure, which will have some impact on 2-wheeler and tractor industry volumes, it said. Monsoon rains so far have been 28 percent above normal; if rainfall is good this year there can be recovery in rural demand around the festive period (October-November), it believes.

Nomura expects 2-wheeler industry volumes to grow at around 5 percent. According to the report, Honda should continue to outperform industry growth due to stronger growth in scooters. Bajaj Auto is likely to see a turnaround in June, with 15 percent growth in domestic motorcycles due to its new entry-level bike the CT100 doing well, it said.

It expects bikes to see lower single digit growth while scooter volumes will likely grow at around 9-10 percent. Eicher Motors's Royal Enfield may report 28 percent volume growth as capacity expands and underlying demand remains quite strong.

M&M’s tractor volumes may decline by around 23 percent Y-o-Y in June.

Overall, Nomura continues to prefer the four-wheeler companies Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland, as it expects volume growth recovery to be much stronger going ahead. ""Strong demand will also help them pull back on discounting and benefit from operating leverage; this, coupled with benign commodity prices, should lead to a sharp margin recovery in FY16F, it feels.

Betting big on the farm sector, homegrown conglomerate Mahindra group is gearing up for a big play in agriculture, leveraging on the brand equity of its tractors, to make it a significant revenue and profit generator in the next five years.

The Mumbai-based group, which forayed into agri-segment in 2010-end, is keeping options open for acquisitions in the range of Rs 100-150 crore in seeds, dairy, irrigation and crop care verticals as it looks to scale up.

Already it is working on various initiatives, including selling of grapes, apples, banana, seed potato, pulses, oilseeds, dairy and micro irrigation.

""Since we are the largest brand in tractors we have fairly high brand equity in Indian agricultural space. Therefore, what we are doing is we are taking our tractor knowledge and expanding it to complete the agri value chain,"" Mahindra & Mahindra Executive Director Pawan Goenka told agency.

Bullish on the sector, he said: ""The way I look into it, five years from now the agri business will become significant revenue and profit generator for Mahindra & Mahindra."" He said when the company started in 2010-end, the agri vertical had a revenue of about Rs 100 crore, which has grown to about Rs 600 crore in four years.

Goenka said as compared to the auto sector, which contributed about Rs 60,000 crore, the agri sector is small but has a huge potential to grow in future.

At present, M&M has a joint venture with Belgium-based Univeg to develop supply chain and sell fresh fruits in the domestic and international markets under the 'Saboro' brand.

Besides, it has inked a JV with Dutch firm HZPC to produce high quality seed potatoes for both domestic and export markets.

It will also start trade with Kenya this year by importing pulses and exporting rice. In mustard oil, M&M plans a pilot project in West Bengal for a branded product this year, while it will also kick off its dairy business most probably in Madhya Pradesh.

Similarly, the group will start its own crop care formulation plant in about three months time.

""In the next few years we are going to consolidate these segments and become meaningful player in terms of size, then from there see what we can get into,"" Goenka said.

When asked about acquisitions, Goenka said the company would not go in for larger ticket acquisitions but look at buyouts in the range of Rs 100-150 crore. Around one lakh farmers are associated with Mahindra across the country."

Korean auto major Hyundai is gunning for the leadership position in the mass-market sports utility vehicle segment in India with its new model, Creta, which will be launched next month.

The company's Indian arm, Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL), has invested Rs 1,000 crore on the development of its upcoming five-seater model.

It will compete with the likes of Mahindra & Mahindra, Renault, Nissan, Ford and Tata Motors in the volume segment of SUVs.

""The SUV segment was growing since 2013 at an annual rate of 25 percent but it has declined in the January-May period by about 6 percent.

With Creta, we are confident of not only bringing volume to Hyundai but also turning around the segment,"" HMIL Senior Vice-President Sales and Marketing Rakesh Srivastava told reporters here at the preview of the new model.

With Creta the company is confident of achieving the leadership position in the segment, he added.

The SUV will compete with the offerings, including Ford Ecosport, Renault Duster, Nissan Terrano and Mahindra Scorpio, Mahindra XUV500 and Tata Safari Storme, which are in a price range of Rs 6.75 lakh to Rs 15.99 lakh.

The Creta has been designed and developed in Korea, while HMIL engineers in Hyderabad and Chennai helped to customise it for the Indian conditions, Srivastava added. ""With Creta we are entering the full-fledged volume segment of SUVs. As of now, we are present in the SUV segment in the premium category with Santa Fe and sports-styled i20 Active,"" he added.

HMIL said the global rollout of Creta will start from India with its launch on July 21 followed soon after by sales in other international markets. The name Creta would be used for all the global markets.

On exports, Srivastava said Creta would be exported, but India will be the first priority."

Homegrown auto major Mahindra & Mahindra plans to launch six new tractors in the next three years, three each under its Mahindra and Swaraj brands.

Expecting good monsoon this year, the company is optimistic about the overall tractor sales in the country to grow about 5 percent and is banking on new introductions to rev up sales.

""We had launched 'Arjun Novo' (under the Mahindra brand) last year which is doing very well but it is in a very small segment.

Towards the end of the financial year, we will be launching the 'Dhruv' in the volume segment and one more product which we will launch sometime in FY17,"" Mahindra & Mahindra Executive Director Pawan Goenka told PTI.

Elaborating on the overall tractor launch plans of the company he said: ""New product wise, basically it is one new product each year for the next three years on the Mahindra side.

I think a similar one on the Swaraj side too."" A new introduction under the Swaraj range in coming up soon, he said.

Under the Mahindra range of tractors, M&M sells models such as Yuvraj, Arjun, Bhoomiputra, Sarpanch and Shaan at a horse power range of 15 HP to over 50 HP.

While under the Swaraj badge, which it acquired from Punjab Tractors in 2007, the company sells models with horse power ranging from less than 30 HP to over 50 HP.

Goenka said the shift towards higher powered tractors in the domestic market is happening at a very slow pace against the expectations set earlier.

""There is a gradual shift towards the higher horse power range but that's very slow. The horse power peak in India at the moment is 60 HP and the most popular is 40-45 HP,"" he added.

So the new products will be in the horse power range where the company already has products, Goenka said.

When asked if the company was looking to bring products from the stable of Mitsubishi Agricultural Machinery (MAM), wherein the company last month announced to acquire 33 percent stake for USD 25 million (over Rs 155 crore), Goenka said there were no immediate plans.

""However, in future we are looking at applications from MAM, where we are not present at the moment such as those used to cater to orchards,"" he said. Commenting on the market conditions, Goenka said the tractor segment would witness some growth provided monsoon does not play a spoilsport.

""Last year, there was a de-growth in the tractor segment. If monsoon is alright this time around, I don't think there is any reason that the industry should not grow by at least 5 percent,"" Goenka said. The company's tractors sale dropped 19.56 percent in May at 19,257 units as against 23,940 units in the same month last year.

For the fiscal 2014-15, the company's total sales had declined by 13 percent to 2,34,023 units as against 2,67,635 units in the previous fiscal."

Mahindra Defense Systems, a Mahindra Group company, and US-listed Telephonics Corporation today announced a joint venture in India to manufacture the new RDR Series of Airborne Weather Radars.

The radars will be made at their Prithla facility near Delhi. This is the first airborne radar to be manufactured in the private sector in India.

The JV named MTIS, first established in 2013, used the aerospace and defence technology from Telephonics Corporation. Initial transfer of technology was for the manufacture of transducers used for both commercial and aerospace applications.

""Over 16,000 have been produced since December 2013. MTIS manufactured the first airborne weather radar assembly in March 2015,"" Mahindra Defence Systems said here at the Paris International Air Show.

With the capability to manufacture airborne radars, MTIS has positioned itself to support the 'Made In India' mandate for the India aerospace and defence sector, the company said, while adding that Mahindras have established a ""clear lead"" compared to other Indian industrial groups in the aerospace and defence arena.

""MTIS continues to make significant progress in its charter to build an indigenous capability to support aerospace and defence programmes leveraging the advanced technologies offered by our partner Telephonics,"" said SP Shukla, Member of the Group Executive Board of Mahindra & Mahindra Limited and Group President, Aerospace and Defence.

""Manufacturing of our RDR airborne weather radar is a key milestone. We are pleased with both the progress MTIS has made and with the support of our joint venture partner, Mahindra and Mahindra,"" said Joseph Battaglia, President and CEO of Telephonics."
