The concept previewed earlier, however, featured a 60 kWh battery pack

Earlier this year, Maruti Suzuki India showcased its eVX concept at the 2023 Auto Expo. With a promise to bring the EV to the streets by 2025, the automaker has been hard at work on its development. The Maruti Suzuki eVX has been undergoing testing for its launch and a test mule has finally been spotted on the roads in Gurugram.

The test vehicle was spotted by YouTuber Speed Shifter, which is completely camouflaged with tell-tale signs of the Maruti Suzuki eVX showcased at the Auto Expo. Of course, the production version of the eVX is going to be toned down but a few features seem to have been carried over to the production version.

The front, for example, features a closed-off grille, which should come as no surprise as the absence of an engine needs no cooling. The headlamps on the test mule are also different compared to the concept but the sculpted design has been carried forward. The rear of the vehicle is fairly raw at the moment. The tail lamp, for example, doesn’t have any kind of glass over it and the internals are in plain view. This is obviously not going to make it to production, but we can expect a connected bar similar to the one on the concept. As far as dimensions go, the eVX is expected to measure 4,300 mm in length, 1,800 mm in width and 1,600 mm in height with a wheelbase measuring 2,700 mm.

The interiors

At the Japan Motor Show held recently, Suzuki also showcased the interiors of the EV as a concept. A minimalist overall design is the highlight along with a large full-colour TFT display that floats over the dash. This functions as both the driver’s display as well as the instrument cluster. The centre console is another floating element between the two front seats and is essentially a touch panel for key functions.

Another feature in the eVX is the two-spoke trapezoidal steering wheel, but this particular shape is unlikely to make it to production and we should see a more conventional wheel when launched. Other features should include a 360-degree camera, ambient lighting, drive mode selector, as well as ADAS and multiple airbags for passenger safety.

In terms of powertrain details, Maruti Suzuki hasn’t revealed anything yet. The concept previewed earlier, however, featured a 60 kWh battery pack. This was then mated to a dual-motor setup for all-wheel-drive capabilities. In this setup, the eVX is capable of completing 550 km on a single charge, however, we could see a smaller 48 kWh battery pack providing a range of about 400 km.

The launch

The Maruti Suzuki eVX is expected to launch sometime in 2025 when more electric SUVs should make it to the market as well. For example, Hyundai is readying an electric variant of the Creta SUV while Kia is setting up its Seltos for an EV variant. Toyota is also working in collaboration with Maruti Suzuki for a Toyota-badged eVX, but the Maruti Suzuki version should make it to the market first. As far as pricing goes, we estimate somewhere in the range of Rs 20-25 lakh, ex-showroom. This will make it a premium offering going up against the likes of even the MG ZS EV."

Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL), which is gearing up to roll out six electric Vehicle (EVs) by the turn of the decade, believes that it is not a late entrant in foraying into battery-run vehicles. MSIL Chairman RC Bhargava believes that it has ample amount of time as the penetration of EVs is less than two percent of the overall Passenger Vehicle (PV) market.

“It is not as if somebody has gone and taken a huge market share and we have been left behind. It will be two percent next year and then we will be in the (EV) market. What is it that we are slow with,” stated Bhargava said on September 26 during a fireside chat session titled ‘Reinventing Maruti: Continuity with Change’ at an event organised by All India Management Association (AIMA).

Bhargava also revealed that it was one of the first automakers which started focussing on EVs by developing the electric variant of WagonR hatchback. However, it didn’t commercially roll out the e-WagonR because the company didn’t find it a “viable proposition”. Eventually, it started working on a bigger sized model called ‘eVX’, which is a ground-up EV and will be rolled out by 2025.

“I think by the time we come into the market with electric cars, there would be the possibility of a reasonable volume being sold,” added Bhargava. He had earlier revealed that its maiden electric car will not be priced below Rs 10 lakh.

When queried on the reason behind coming up with six models, Bhargava maintained, “By 2030, the sale of cars in the domestic market itself will be somewhere close to six and a half to 7 million cars (per annum). If were to keep 45 to 50 percent (share) of the market, we can’t do it by having one or two models. We need to have a large number of models to get the kind of volume that you want to have. And six models, we feel are the minimum required. Even with six models, we think that by 2030, only about 15 to 20 percent of our sales will be electric vehicles.”

Meanwhile, MSIL is aiming for complete indigenisation of its entire lineup. While the passenger vehicle (PV) market leader still depends on imports for certain critical components, especially semiconductor chips, Bhargava believes that once domestic electronics manufacturing catches up, the country can reduce its dependence on overseas markets.

“Today, virtually all electronics that go into the cars are being imported. There is no real electronics (manufacturing) industry in India. So to get the supply chain to become more reliant and stable for India, I think what the government is doing -- getting electronic manufacturers, especially semiconductor makers into the country -- is one of the very essential requirements,” revealed Bhargava.

Bhargava also outlined how Maruti set new standards and processes and showed new ways of building supply chains.

“We have a strong supply chain, (but) the weakness we have is that there are a few new technologies- internal components of assemblies- which are not being manufactured in India and we need people (companies) to come and manufacture here. The biggest area (to look into) is semiconductors,” he observed.

Over the last few years, MSIL has been sharpening its focus on high-margin premium offerings such as Baleno, XL6, Grand Vitara, Jimny, Ciaz, Invicto and Fronx, which are retailed across its Nexa chain of outlets. Unlike its low-cost product lines, all the aforementioned models are equipped with connected car features and other technologies that are underpinned by multiple semiconductor chips.

“Every car manufacturer has to get more component manufacturers into India. So that India not only becomes self-reliant in its supply chain but also becomes an integral part of the global supply chain for many other countries which are looking for something other than China,"" Bhargava noted.

Even while Prime Minister Narendra Modi is aiming for a self-reliant nation when it comes to building products in the country, it may be a long road ahead for the automobile industry to align with that vision. The automobile sector, which contributes 7.1 percent to the overall GDP and 49 percent to the manufacturing GDP, is still dependent on countries like China and Taiwan for sourcing certain critical inputs like semiconductors and battery cells.

Talking about capabilities from the domestic supply chain, the MSIL chairman stated, “One of the essence of the Indian car industry is the way the component industry has grown over the years. The component industry is not merely supplying to India but exporting to worldwide markets. I think exports have gone up, about $20 billion of components are exported out of India.”

He further maintained that the semiconductor availability is improving, and there will be negligible impact on its production.

“At the moment, there is no real constraint on the semiconductor front. In the second half of this year, beginning from October, I don't think our production will be affected because of any shortage of semiconductors. So I think you can be rest assured that if you're planning to buy a car, it will not get delayed because of semiconductors,"" asserted Bhargava."

Kotak Institutional Equities has retained the 'sell' rating on Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and downgraded Tata Motors Ltd to 'sell' from 'reduce' after the recent rally in the stocks. The brokerage house also said that the muted trend in the passenger vehicle segment remains a cause for concern.

Since the start of April, Maruti Suzuki India zoomed 18 percent, while Tata Motors surged over 52 percent.

Kotak has revised the target price on Maruti to Rs 8,150 from Rs 7,850 a share, while for Tata Motors, it has revised the revised target price to Rs 550 from Rs 530 a share.

The broker predicts that Maruti Suzuki's market share will stay at 41.5-42 percent, even with the launch of SUV and MUV models. It anticipates the company's market share to remain stable in the hatchback and sedan segments, while showing a slight decrease in the MUV segment.

""In the SUV segment, we expect the company’s market share to improve to 18 percent in FY2024 from 12 percent a year ago, led by market share gain in the micro-SUV (Fronx), mid-size SUV (Grand Vitara) and large SUV segments (Jimny). However, we expect the company’s market share to decline 50-60 bps over FY2025-26, mainly owing to the competition in the SUV segment. Despite gain in the SUV segment, Maruti Suzuki’s market share is expected to remain flat due to a decline in the hatchback segment’s mix, where Maruti Suzuki has above 70 percent market share,"" the Kotak report said.

Kotak forecasts that Tata Motors' market share will decrease by 50 basis points (bps) year-on-year in FY2024, primarily because of heightened competition in the micro-SUV segment, where Maruti Suzuki Fronx and Hyundai Exter are expected to intensify the competition. However, this decline will partly be offset by gains in the hatchback segment, resulting from the introduction of CNG and EV trims for existing models.

In FY2024, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) is likely to experience a 60 basis points (bps) on-year improvement in market share, reaching 9.8 percent. This growth is attributed to the company's robust order backlog and the limited competition it faces in the large SUV segment, which contributes significantly to its overall volumes. On the other hand, Hyundai Motors is expected to witness a slight increase in market share from FY2023 to FY2026. This growth will be driven primarily by the launch of the micro-SUV Exter at a competitive price point, helping the company to strengthen its position in the market, the Kotak report added.

Kotak anticipates a 4 percent year-on-year growth in the domestic passenger vehicle (PV) industry volumes for FY2024. This growth will be driven by persistent weakness in the entry-level car segment and a decline in pent-up demand.

The brokerage house forecasts that market shares of passenger vehicle industry players will remain stable from FY2024 to FY2026. This steadiness is attributed to the introduction of new models in fast-growing segments such as SUVs, CNG, and EVs, enabling the companies to maintain their position in the market."

Maruti Suzuki India on Monday said it has introduced a pedestrian safety vehicle alarm feature in the electric hybrid variants of its SUV Grand Vitara, which will push up prices by up to Rs 4,000.

The company announced the addition of Acoustic Vehicle Alerting System (AVAS) for the intelligent electric hybrid variants of the Grand Vitara. This technology is designed to help keep drivers and pedestrians safe by alerting them about the presence of a vehicle, Maruti Suzuki India said in a regulatory filing.

The system works by emitting a low-level alert sound that can be heard up to five feet away, giving pedestrians and other nearby drivers a heads-up that a vehicle is nearby, it added. The addition of AVAS for pedestrian safety makes the Grand Vitara compliant with upcoming regulations, the company said.

The price change in these variants of the Grand Vitara ranges up to Rs 4,000 (ex-showroom Delhi) effective from July 17, 2023, it added. The electric hybrid variants of the Grand Vitara are priced at Rs 18.29 lakh and Rs 19.79 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi)."
"July 13, 2023 02:10 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/automobile/the-drive-report-maruti-suzuki-invicto-10939451.html,"The Invicto, building on an already established name, received more than 6,000 orders even before it was launched.

Maruti Suzuki recently grabbed headlines by launching its most expensive car in India. With prices starting at Rs 24.79 lakh (ex-showroom) the Invicto propels the country’s largest carmaker into uncharted territory, that of the premium MPV or multi-purpose vehicle. The vehicle is, for all intents and purposes, a badge-engineered twin of the highly coveted Toyota Innova Hycross. Much like the preceding line of vehicles including the Suzuki Grand Vitara and the Glanza, which emerged from the Suzuki-Toyota partnership, the Invicto offers no technological advantage over its identical twin. It comes with a petrol-hybrid powertrain only and, save for a few bells and whistles, offers the same performance as the Innova Hycross. Which begs the question: why did Maruti Suzuki decide to enter terrain it has previously been unable to thrive in, especially when the alternative wears a badge with greater aspirational value?

This isn’t the first time Maruti Suzuki has launched a premium product in the market. Back in 2011, the brand introduced a premium sedan called the Kizashi. With its sensational design and robust powertrain, the sedan was brought in to take on the likes of the Honda Civic but was discontinued in 2014, primarily because no one wished to pay big bucks for what was a mass market brand.

Maruti Suzuki’s senior executive director of sales and marketing, Shashank Srivastava, begs to differ. “The Kizashi was brought in as a CBU (completely built-up unit, which attracts a higher import tax slab), and so was priced higher than its direct rivals. It wasn’t the product but the fact that it was imported that didn’t work.”

The Invicto, building on an already established name, received more than 6,000 orders even before it was launched. On the day of the launch, Maruti Suzuki’s share price hit a record high of Rs 10,036.70.

For starters, the Toyota Innova Hycross hybrid commands a waiting period as long as 26 months. Despite the MPV sitting above the sales phenomenon that is the Innova Crysta, Toyota cannot make enough of them fast enough. And yet, as per the terms of agreement with Maruti Suzuki, it must set aside a certain percentage of Hycross models for its partner, thereby allowing Maruti Suzuki customers to get their hands on an Invicto quicker than they would in the case of the Hycross. Advantage Maruti Suzuki.

It’s evident that Maruti Suzuki has been the primary beneficiary of this partnership. The brand, for its part, gets to bolster its relatively young SUV portfolio with a formidable premium MPV clearly marking out the luxury end of the spectrum. Counting the Brezza, Maruti Suzuki now has four different SUVs in its portfolio, each operating in a different price bracket. In return, Maruti Suzuki, which produces 1.3 million units every year, is using its sway with policymakers to help Toyota acquire higher semiconductor allotments. Toyota, however, has reserved the top-end trim of the Hycross hybrid for itself, with the ottoman-equipped seats not finding their way to the Invicto. And Maruti Suzuki, in order to further differentiate the Invicto from the Innova Hycross, has limited sales to private owners only and not fleet cab operators.

The Invicto

At Rs 24.79 lakh, the base Zeta+ version of the Invicto is cheaper than the base Hycross by approximately Rs 24,000. As a result it does miss out on a few features including a 360-degree camera, parking sensors and automatic folding rear-view mirrors, among others. What it gains, however, are four additional airbags. The Invicto also gets smaller 17-inch wheels, instead of the Hycross’ 18-inch alloys, an attribute that helps give it a marginally improved ride quality while, on the flip side, looking a tad ungainly on such a large vehicle.

Of course, there are some visual changes. As with other Suzuki-badged Toyotas and vice-versa, the look of the grille, bumper and tail lamp clusters has been reworked, with two vertical chrome bars running across the Invicto’s hexagonal grille. The tail lamps have also been redesigned and, truth be told, the Invicto does seem to be the better looking vehicle with cleaner lines defining its front and rear. The powertrain, of course, remains the same, with a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder, turbo-petrol paired to an eCVT along with an electric motor giving it a combined power output of 184 bhp. This beast of a seven-seater doesn’t quite surge nor lumber ahead. Power has been calibrated with fuel efficiency in mind, and the Invicto claims a figure of 23.24 kilometres per litre, a figure that’s identical to the hybrid Hycross.

The interiors, as expected, are also near-identical with the only marked difference lying in the dashboard trim. The Invicto ditches the dual-tone dash treatment, instead opting for an all-black leather dash with copper-coloured accents bordering the AC vents, door handles and centre console. The top-end version, which is nearly Rs 1 lakh cheaper than its direct counterpart in the Hycross range, misses out on crucial ADAS features, something Maruti Suzuki’s research suggested wasn't crucial to purchasing decisions.

In terms of handling and powertrain, there is little to set it apart from the Hycross. Even the suspension damping remains the same, resulting in a barely discernible difference in ride quality, save for the advantage provided by the smaller wheels. Despite the driving modes, the Invicto is a big moose of an MPV. It wafts over pretty much any surface, offering magic carpet-like ride quality and acres of space. Yes, the eCVT does not like to be rushed, like most eCVTs, and the driving modes do nothing to change that. The paddle shifters do offer some respite, but the transmission unit prefers gentler throttle inputs. What’s truly remarkable is how you don’t get to feel the Invicto’s size. The steering is incredibly light, offering little in terms of feedback, but manoeuvring the Invicto requires no effort on the driver’s part.

VERDICT

For Maruti Suzuki, the Invicto is about establishing a toehold in the premium MPV space and, more importantly, increasing its market share in the SUV category. According to Srivastava, the brand’s SUV market share was 12.1 percent last year, while its market share in the non-SUV space is over 65 percent. And the Invicto’s timely arrival, when Innova Hycross customers face long waits for delivery means that for customers, it’s a roundabout way of purchasing what is effectively an Innova. Without the waiting period, most customers would prefer the badge value of a sub-Rs 30 lakh Toyota over a sub-Rs 30 lakh Maruti Suzuki. But given that Maruti has gotten Toyota to set aside a chunk of its most premium MPV for Maruti Suzuki’s own customers, customers will buy whatever they can get their hands on first."

Maruti Suzuki expects to keep growing faster than the domestic passenger vehicle industry riding on the back of strong demand for its models especially the SUV range, according to a senior company executive.

The auto major anticipates the overall passenger vehicle market to grow in the range of 5-7 per cent this fiscal. In an interaction with PTI, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) Senior Executive Officer (Marketing and Sales) Shashank Srivastava said the PV industry is expected to close the current fiscal at 40.5-41.3 lakh units.

”We have not revised our estimates which we had made at the beginning of the year. We said the industry growth would be in the 5-7 per cent range and our growth should be higher than the industry,” Srivastava said. He noted that in the first quarter, the company grew by 12.2 per cent while the industry grew by around 9.5 per cent.

Srivastava said that the demand remains fairly robust so far in the fiscal with the April-June period turning out to be the best quarter ever for the industry. ”We believe going forward while the volumes may hold because bookings remain strong, the growth may be muted and the reason I say that is because the base effect may be coming into effect now,” he said.

He said last year in the second quarter, the sales stood at 10.2 lakh units which was the highest quarter in the history of PVs. ”So to have growth significantly higher may be unreasonable to expect,” Srivastava stated.

When asked about the company’s preparation for the upcoming festive season, he noted that with the semiconductor shortage subsiding, the automaker aims to enhance production and bring down the waiting period on models like Ertiga, Brezza and XL6 significantly. MSI currently has a pending booking backlog of around 3.62 lakh units.

”In the second quarter, we are expecting the semiconductor shortage to be comparatively less and therefore, we will be able to produce these models and hopefully we would be able to bring down the waiting period for customers,” Srivastava said.

On the company’s plans regarding the introduction of more hybrid models going ahead, he said: ”It is going to be significant as we have said that by 2030 the rough break up will be 15 per cent electric, 25 per cent hybrid and 60 per cent CNG, biogas, ethanol, blended gasoline etc.”

He further said that the company currently just has two hybrid models in its portfolio and the number is expected to increase in the future. ”We won’t be able to give the exact number of models which will come up but the percentages do indicate something like that (model number to increase),” Srivastava said.

He noted that CNG along with hybrid car sales this year should match the company’s peak of diesel sales which stood at 4.8 lakh units in 2017-18."

Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra and other automakers have started reporting their sales number for the month of April. Maruti reported a rise of 6.5 percent in total dispatches to dealerships in April over the same period last year. MG Motors reported a two-fold rise in retail sales at 4,551 units in April.

Semiconductor shortage continues to pose a challenge for automakers. The shortage of electronic components had some impact on the production of vehicles, Maruti Suzuki said while releasing the numbers.

Automakers reported stellar sales figures in 2022-23- on the back of pent-up demand and preference among buyers for SUVs. According to initial estimates, FY23 saw sales of 38.9 lakh units, a 27 percent growth over the 30.7 lakh units dispatched in the previous financial year.

The growth last fiscal was dominated by the SUV sales. Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director, Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles and Tata Passenger Electric Mobility attributed to the strong FY23 show to post-COVID pent-up demand in the early part of the year, the launch of several new vehicles, and easing of the semiconductor shortage.

Ladakh, located in the northernmost part of India, is known for its breathtaking natural beauty, serene landscapes, and a unique culture that is deeply rooted in its geography. However, the region has been witnessing rapid industrialization and commercialization in recent years with mining and hydroelectric projects, causing significant harm to its natural ecosystem."
"April 13, 2023 02:32 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/maruti-eyes-doubling-suv-sales-this-fiscal-take-leadership-position-with-25-percent-market-share-10383481.html,"The country’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India aims to more than double its SUV sales this year and take the leadership position in the fast-growing segment with a market share of over 25 per cent, according to a senior company official.

The auto major sold 2.02 lakh sports utility vehicles (SUVs) last financial year with a market share of around 13 per cent. In the current fiscal year, the company aims to sell around 5 lakh units. The SUV segment is currently the fastest-growing vertical in the domestic passenger vehicle industry.

In an interaction with PTI, Maruti Suzuki India Senior Executive Officer (Sales & Marketing) Shashank Srivastava said the doubling of the market share in the SUV segment would also help the company in its bid to again surpass the 50 per cent market share mark in the domestic passenger vehicle industry.

""This fiscal year we expect our SUV market share to rise to 25 per cent. The SUV market is expected to be around 19 lakh units this year,” Srivastava said. For the company, Brezza is leading the entry SUV segment while a full impact of Grand Vitara in terms of sales is also expected to come into play this year, he noted. Besides, the addition of two new models — Jimny and Fronx — would also help in bringing in additional volumes this fiscal, he added.

Srivastava noted that MSI has already received close to 41,000 bookings for the two models which are slated to hit the market over the next few months. He noted that the company’s SUV market share has been increasing over the last few fiscal. It stood at 10.5 per cent in 2021-22 and increased to 13 per cent last fiscal, he stated.

""We ended the fourth quarter at around 17 per cent. So we have gained market share due to the better availability of Brezza and the introduction of Grand Vitara. And now Fronx and Jimny should give us additional numbers. So we are hoping that we will be number one in the SUV space this year,” Srivastava said.

MSI competes with Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, and Hyundai Motor India for the top slot in the SUV space. Srivastava said the company’s market share in the non-SUV segment stood at around 65 per cent but due to low penetration in the SUV segment, its overall market share has gone below the 45 per cent level.

""If we want to increase it towards 50 per cent, we will have to increase our market share in the SUV space and this is what we are trying to do,” he added. When asked if the current product range would be sufficient to make gains in the segment, Srivastava said: ""With these four vehicles, we hope that we can be the leading player in the segment.”

MSI also remains bullish on the CNG segment despite an increase in the price of the fuel impacting the overall sales in the vertical. Despite the increase in prices, the company sold 3.25 lakh units last fiscal as compared with 2.34 lakh units in 2021-22, Srivastava said. So the growth was like 45-46 per cent and our total penetration went from 17 per cent to 20 per cent in FY23, he added.

""We now have 75 per cent market share in the CNG space (passenger vehicle segment) and going forward our sales projection for this fiscal is over 4.5 lakh units,” Srivastava noted. MSI currently sells 14 company models with a CNG option. When asked if the company aims to expand the model range further, Srivastava said: ""We are looking very closely at the market because if there is a downward revision of the prices going ahead then we can see even larger traction compared to what we have seen last year.”

The company is watching the market closely and if required would study if CNG technology could be introduced in other models as well, he added. On the company’s plans regarding the electric segment, Srivastava said the company plans to have six battery electric vehicles in its portfolio by 2030.

The six models would account roughly for 15 per cent of the company’s overall product range. MSI plans to drive its first battery electric vehicle in the next financial year, Srivastava noted. ""In 2030, the overall portfolio of the company will look something like..60 per cent will be CNG and internal combustion engine vehicles, 25 per cent would be hybrid and 15 per cent will be electric,” he said."

Note to readers: Fit to lead is a series of interviews with business leaders on their approach to fitness, leadership and navigating the new normal.

Shashank Srivastava enjoys the company of people, has the most fun when he is meeting customers, leading teams and is able to travel. He is visibly not a fan of Zoom and Microsoft Teams calls despite having been on plenty, including this interview, since the pandemic but he is full of anecdotes, stories and plenty of answers. Also, he is still in his first job and he has been at it since 1989, when he joined Maruti Suzuki, then a public sector unit, straight out of Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIM-A). Between his growth from an executive in the corporate planning strategy team and his current role as the Senior Executive Officer for Marketing and Sales at Maruti Suzuki, the 58-year-old has held several key roles and also witnessed the company’s transition from a PSU to a listed company.

Srivastava grew up in Bhopal and studied telecommunication and electronics engineering at NIT, Bhopal, before joining IIM-A in 1987. During campus placements, he already had offers from Asian Paints and L&T, but chose to interview for Maruti Suzuki because he knew he wanted to be in the automobile industry.

Srivastava, who visited 163 countries during his stint in international marketing for the company, says that his was a great learning experience. “It was the first time I was working in markets where we were not the leader. The approach is very different when you aren’t on top and I learned a lot,” says Srivastava, who is facing similar challenges in India when it comes to SUVs and its Nexa brand. Another issue he wants to address right away is the waiting period for the customers and believes if that is cut, Maruti Suzuki’s customer retention rate would improve while attrition rate would drop. Srivastava, who dedicates an hour of his day to walking and other activities to remain healthy and fit, feels prioritising on wellness helped him achieve more success both personally and professionally and would like to “motivate team members to find their own outlet for physical activity as it teaches you the consistency that helps in your professional life as well.”

Excerpts from an interview:

Your fitness routine…

I take out about an hour daily as part of my fitness regimen. It includes exercises such as strength training, cardio, yoga and mindfulness throughout the week.

Favourite fitness activity?

I enjoy vigorous walking. I kickstart my day with it. It helps me clear my mind, boost my energy and fuel my creativity.

The toughest…

High-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts. They can be incredibly demanding and require one to push beyond their limits.

How does your fitness routine help you strike a work-life balance?

Often, we let our work take centerstage in our lives. It wasn't until a few years ago that I began to take my health and wellness more seriously. Since then, I have made it a habit to prioritise my fitness routine, which has helped me achieve a better work-life balance by providing me with a healthy outlet for stress and helping me maintain a positive outlook.

The new normal for you…

My new normal at work and in life has been largely shaped by the pandemic. At work, we have had to adapt to new ways of doing business and interacting with our customers. This has involved leveraging technology to facilitate remote interactions and embracing a more agile approach to decision-making. Outside of work, I have been prioritising my health and wellbeing.

Has your fitness routine helped you navigate the uncertainties of recent times?

I have incorporated mindful breaks throughout the day to recharge and maintain focus. These breaks include stretching, meditation, and even enjoying a cup of tea, which has helped me immensely. Regular exercise has helped reduce stress and anxiety, boost the immune system, and improve overall wellbeing.

Your leadership style…

I believe it is one that emphasises empowering my team members through collaboration and communication. My intention is to help others succeed and become leaders in their own right. True leadership is, therefore, not about being in charge but inspiring and guiding others to achieve their full potential. It is about creating a culture of continuous learning and development. When we invest in our colleagues’ growth and development, we develop better leaders and build a more substantial organisation.

The one change you would encourage your teammates to make to deal with the challenges of current times.

I encourage my teammates to prioritise their mental and physical health, which have become increasingly important during the current challenges.

Has being fit helped you become a better leader?

Definitely… being fit has helped me become a better version of myself. When team members see that their leader is committed to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, they may be more likely to follow suit. A workplace that prioritises wellness can create a positive and supportive environment that provides a fillip to the team’s morale and increases productivity. Ultimately, my goal is to create a culture that values wellbeing.

Leadership lessons in your fitness journey…

I have learned that consistency is the key to attaining achievements, hard work pays off, and it is crucial to establish clear objectives and monitor progress.

Goals and challenges for the next year…

My goals for the next year include continuing to prioritise my wellness, inspiring my team to do the same, and achieving greater collective success. On the work front, I’d like to win back our market share in SUVs through multiple new launches and also make Nexa the number one brand in the country."
"March 19, 2023 11:03 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tata-motors-upgrades-pv-range-to-conform-to-stricter-emission-norms-maruti-mahindra-on-course-10273301.html,"\Tata Motors has upgraded its passenger vehicle portfolio to conform to stricter emission norms while Maruti Suzuki India and Mahindra & Mahindra are confident of transitioning their respective product range before the April 1 deadline.

The Indian automobile industry is currently working to make their products meet the second phase of Bharat Stage VI, equivalent to Euro-VI emission norms, in real-time driving conditions.

Four-wheeler passenger and commercial vehicles will need more sophisticated equipment to be added to meet the next level of emission standards. The second phase of BS-VI emission norms are set to kick in from April 1.

Car prices are also expected to rise as automobile companies are investing to add additional equipment in powertrains.

Our portfolio has already transitioned to BS-VI phase 2 emission norms in February 2023, ahead of the regulation timelines. We have also enhanced the products with improved performance, added new technology features and increased warranty of our vehicles,"" Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Managing Director Shailesh Chandra told PTI.

As far as pricing is concerned, part of the cost escalation arising out of this regulatory change has partially been passed on in the price increase announced in February, he noted.

""Remaining part may be passed on in the next price hike. Can't confirm any timeline on the same,"" Chandra said.

Mahindra & Mahindra President Automotive Division Veejay Nakra noted that all company models will comply with BS-VI phase 2 norms as per timelines set by the government.

""The cost increase is much lower than the cost of BS-IV to BS-VI transition and will be passed on to consumers in a phased manner,"" he added.

Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director Corporate Affairs Rahul Bharti stated that the auto major is fully committed to a cleaner environment and will complete the BS-VI phase-2 transition well in time.

""In fact, out of our total 62 applications, we had transitioned 31 applications to BS-VI phase-2 almost a year ahead of the compliance date,"" he added.

Even in 2019-20, Maruti Suzuki had upgraded many of its cars from BS-IV to BS-VI well before the compliance date, Bharti stated.

He noted that the Maruti Suzuki fleet currently has the least CO2 emission per car among all car manufacturers in the country which will keep getting lower.

From April 1, vehicles will need to have an on-board self-diagnostic device to monitor the real-time driving emission levels. The device will constantly monitor key parts for meeting emission standards such as the catalytic converter and oxygen sensors, to keep a close watch on emissions.

In a scenario wherein emissions exceed the parameters, the device will indicate through warning lights that the vehicle be submitted for a service.

Additionally, in order to control the level of fuel burnt, vehicles will also carry programmed fuel injectors, which would control the timing and amount of fuel injected into the petrol engine.

Even semiconductors used by the vehicle will have to be upgraded to monitor throttle, crankshaft positions, air intake pressure, temperature of the engine and the contents of the emissions from the exhaust (particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, CO2, sulphur), etc.

India had leapfrogged to BS-VI emission regime from BS IV norm with effect from April 1, 2020. The transition saw the domestic automobile industry pumping in around Rs 70,000 crore to upgrade its technology.

In 2016, the government asked the automobile industry to upgrade to BS-VI norms by April 2020.

The short deadline was unprecedented anywhere in the world as it was a leap from BS-IV to BS-VI. Deteriorating air pollution situation in various cities, including Delhi-NCR, was one of the prominent reasons to usher in stricter vehicular emission norms in the country.

Sulphur content is the major difference between BS-IV and BS-VI norms."

Maruti Suzuki will see a drop in production of some of its models in March due to chip shortage which would be higher than that in January and February, Shashank Srivastava, senior executive officer-marketing & sales, has told CNBC-TV 18.

Speaking about the loss of 46,000 vehicles in production in the third quarter, Srivastava said, ""There was a loss in January and February as well largely because of semi-conductor shortage. In March also, we will be losing production in some of our models and that loss is going to be higher than what we saw in January and February.""

He said supply problems were persisting and for some models in a larger way, which had caused longer waiting periods. ""Our inventory level at the end of Feb was 95,000 units, which is 2.5 weeks of inventory,"" Srivastava said.

Also read | Maruti Suzuki sales up 5% in February at 1,72,321 units

The passenger vehicle industry in 2023 could end at around 3.88 million, which would translate to a growth of 26 percent over the last year's figure of 3.07 million, he said.

""In the next year, the projection so far is a 5-7 percent growth and what we are looking at is an industry of 4.05-4.1 million,"" he said.

There has been a slight slowdown in booking momentum and inquiries over the last few weeks, Srivastava said.

The senior executive, however, expects the country’s biggest carmaker to grow higher than industry levels in FY24.

He also confirmed that the company was looking at the sports utility vehicle (SUV) space quite aggressively and intended ""to be number one SUV manufacturer in FY24"".

Maruti Suzuki's parent company Suzuki Motors bought 3.45 lakh shares worth Rs 300 crores from the open market, increasing its stake to 56.48 percent, the carmaker said on March 15.

Srivastava declined to comment on the share purchase, saying he had little knowledge about the development.

At 11.18 am, Maruti Suzuki was trading at Rs 8,515.70 on the National Stock Exchange, up 0.48 percent from the previous day."

The Auto Expo, which is usually a biennial event, was extended by a year this time around and that kept manufacturers eager to showcase what they had in store for the future of Indian automobile. The Day 1 of the event was jam-packed with exciting launches and unveils, most of which were in the EV segment.

Maruti Suzuki

Home-grown manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki kicked off the event with the unveiling of their first EV, the eVX concept. The SUV is the company’s first born-electric vehicle and is based on a EV dedicated architecture that was co-developed with Toyota. So far, the eVX concept comes powered by a 60 kWh battery pack that will allow for a range of 500 km.

MG

MG was next in line and showcased a number of new cars including the upcoming MG4 electric hatchback, MG5 electric station wagon, eMG6 plug-in hybrid sedan and a few more. The highlight of the event, however, was the launch of the facelifted Hector and Hector Plus SUVs with prices starting at Rs 14.73 lakh and Rs 17.49 lakh respectively. First launched in 2019, the Hector and Hector Plus, both get reworked exteriors, new interiors and ADAS functionality.

Hyundai

After months and months of waiting, Hyundai finally brought the Ioniq 5 to India making it their second EV in the India portfolio. The EV hatchback has been greatly anticipated because of its retro styling and thanks to it being assembled locally, Hyundai has managed to stick on an introductory price tag of just Rs 44.95 lakh. For context, the Kia EV6 which is exactly the same as the Ioniq save for the design is brought in as a CBU and is priced at Rs 60.95 lakh. Another big showcase was the Ioniq 6 EV sedan, Hyundai’s third EV globally. It is based on the same E-GMP platform as the 5 and features sportier styling when compared to the hatchback. It’s aerodynamics also allow for a drag coefficient of just 0.21 which is one of the lowest on any electric car.

Kia

Kia’s showcased two SUVs at their presentation on day 1. The first was upcoming flagship, the EV9 SUV. Official numbers are yet to be revealed, but the Korean car company has confirmed that the EV9 is set to enter production by the end of the year. The company also showcased the all-new KA4. Essentially the next-gen Carnival, the KA4 gets new styling updates, refreshed interiors, more features as well as ADAS technology.

BYD

BYD first launched the Atto 3 SUV in a new Forest Green Edition. Only 1,200 units have been earmarked for India, but the standard SUV has been on sale in India and the special edition is just a new paint scheme. The bigger unveil was that of the BYD Seal, an electric sedan that the company says will make it to our shores by the fourth quarter of this year. When launched, it will go up against the likes of the BMW i4. Internationally, the Seal gets a single- and dual-motor engine option along with 61.4 kWh and 82.5 kWh battery pack options.

Lexus

Lexus is the only luxury brand making an appearance at the 2023 auto, but there was no stopping their showcasings. The company unveiled the LM 300h, a Lexus version of the Toyota Vellfire which is scheduled for launch later this year. Lexus also debuted the RX SUV in both its smaller 350h and performance oriented 500h forms. And finally, the company also showcased the LF-30 and LF-Z electric vehicle concepts.

Toyota

Toyota’s flagship, the Land Cruiser hasn’t been updated for the Indian market in nearly 14 years. Toyota took this opportunity to finally unveil the Land Cruiser LC 300 complete with new looks, refreshed interiors, more tech and a new powertrain.

Tata Motors

And finally, Tata Motors with their slew of new unveilings. The ICE variant of the Curvv was first on display with a promise to launch by 2024. The biggest surprise was that of the Harrier EV concept. Essentially a close-to-production model, the Harrier EV is also slated for a 2024 launch. And finally, Tata Motors showcased for the second time, the Tata Sierra. As compared to the first concept unveiled at the 2020 Auto Expo, the Sierra seems to be a lot more fleshed out with new design cues and two extra doors."

Automobile makers led by Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai and Tata Motors, along with Mahindra & Mahindra, Kia India and Honda Cars India on Tuesday reported strong sales of passenger vehicles in the domestic market riding on strong festive season demand.

However, in the two-wheeler segment, most of the manufacturers such as Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India, and TVS Motor reported subdued sales during the festive season, which normally leads to high takeoff of motorcycles and scooters.

Market leader Maruti Suzuki India reported a 26 per cent rise in its domestic sales at 1,47,072 units last month as against 1,17,013 units in the year-ago period.

The company's sales of mini segment cars, comprising Alto and S-Presso, grew to 24,936 units as against 21,831 units in October 2021. Sales of compact cars, including Baleno, Celerio, Dzire, Ignis, Swift, Tour S and WagonR, rose to 73,685 units last month as compared to 48,690 units in the year-ago month.

Maruti Suzuki India Senior Executive Officer (Marketing & Sales) Shashank Srivastava said the SUVs continued to lead the sales charts last month while the sales of entry level models also witnessed enhanced offtake as compared with past few months.

Alto, WagonR, Swift and Baleno were the leading models last month with seven models from the auto major making it to the top ten selling list, he said.

Srivastava noted that the passenger vehicle wholesales last month were the third highest ever behind just July and September dispatches this year.

""The passenger vehicle industry in the April-October stood at 22.74 lakh units as compared with 16.48 lakh units last year, a growth of 38 per cent. It is expected this year we should see a figure of 38 lakh units for the industry. For MSI, we are expecting a similar number as last year which was the highest,"" he stated.

Srivastava said the company had close to 3.9 lakh pending bookings while the industry figure stood at around 8 lakh units.

With strong response for both the new Brezza and Grand Vitara, the company's overall market share in the SUV segment has grown to around 14 per cent in October from around 9.5 per cent last year, he added.

Hyundai Motor India Ltd (HMIL) reported a 29.6 per cent jump in its domestic PV sales at 48,001 last month as compared to 37,021 units in October 2021.

HMIL Director (Sales, Marketing & Service) Tarun Garg said with the ever improving semiconductor situation, the company was able to meet the demand of its customers and deliver cars during the festive season in October.

The worst of the commodity price spike the world experienced in the first six months of 2022 is behind us, says Sandeep Bhatia, the Head of Equity and Country Head-India at Macquarie Group.

Prices of oil and other commodities had surged in the lead-up to and the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, but have since eased.

In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Bhatia shared his views on the current market rally and spoke about the Information Technology (IT) sector, future of electric vehicles and the scope offered by the country’s defence sector.

The National Stock Exchange (NSE) benchmark Nifty50 on Tuesday closed above the psychological level of 18,000 points. ""Diwali has come a month early in the markets,"" Bhatia said.

He added: ""We’ll probably go into the third quarter of this financial year or fourth quarter of this current year quite strong. The market has legs to it.""

The only disappointment, according to Bhatia, has been a ""sort of weak monsoon"".

Moving on, he spoke about broader industrial consumption trends which ""are still holding up."" He expects the market to rise by another 8-10 percent in the next three to four months.

According to him, in the first quarter of next year, with the budget around the corner, there is a possibility of investors booking profits.

Verdict on large cap IT names

""We like the IT sector. We like HCL Tech, TCS, Infosys, so we definitely like that. Our call here is that we’ll continue to see decent earnings growth -- 10 to 12 percent earnings growth,"" Bhatia said.

Given negativity around the IT sector because of expectations of a recession in the US and European Union, Bhatia said ""we are seeing a lot of pushback.""

He added: ""US will not have as big and as deep a recession as we have seen in the previous cycle. So to that extent, the IT sector offers very good value at current levels.""

Operational pressure

Apart from US recession concerns, there exist worries over large companies such as Infosys and HCL Technologies, which are seeing margins at multi-quarter lows for the past 10-12 quarters.

Bhatia said there could be some negative news flow from the US, but even so India was not witnessing the kind of big layoffs that 2008 saw.

""I don’t think that the economy at least in the US will take such a big hit. I think the real challenge will be in Europe, not as much in US. At least on the entire balance between valuations, earnings, and growth, the IT sector stands out.""

Electric Vehicles

In the automobile industry, companies like Mahindra & Mahindra are making big investments in manufacturing Electric Vehicles (EVs). They are investing Rs 9,000-10,000 crore over the next couple of years in EVs.

Bhatia said the automobile industry and the EV space was worth looking at.

He added: ""I would still go with the large players, which are essentially Maruti, Tata Motors and Mahindra. Mahindra is being a standout because its product cycle has surprised both in terms of consumer response and the fact that the slew of products that have been launched have clearly upped the game in terms of product quality that M&M used to come out with.""

He picked Mahindra as the ""dark horse"" in the auto sector.

Bhatia expects Tata Motors and Mahindra to dominate the EV market over the next couple of years.

Defence sector

The defence sector is difficult to predict because it's lumpy and largely ""project and government-policy based,"" Bhatia said.

Structurally, the sector is headed in the direction of Make in India and on the defence front, some major platforms will see Indian corporate sectors come in and start contributing.

""Although if you want to look at it given the entire cycle of defence purchases in India, these will take five plus years if not more,"" he observed.

While it's worth keeping an eye on, ""I don't think you can deploy big sums of money or build any kind of big earnings projections which can be valid and credible in next 2-3 years,"" Bhatia said."

Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd has overtaken Tata Motors Ltd in terms of market capitalisation to become the second most valued auto company in India.

The market capitalisation for M&M stood at Rs 1.64 trillion with its shares touching an all time high of Rs 1,331 apiece on the BSE on Thursday. Tata Motors Ltd was trading 1 percent lower at Rs 442 a share while its MCap reached Rs 1.47 trillion. M&M has gained 57 percent so far this year, while Tata Motors declined over 8 percent.

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd remained India's most valued auto firm with an MCap of Rs 2.66 trillion.

M&M enjoys a leadership position in farm equipment, utility vehicles, information technology and financial services in India and is the world’s largest tractor company by volume.

Tata Motors' diverse portfolio includes an extensive range of cars, sports utility vehicles, trucks, buses and defence vehicles. It is one of India's largest OEMs offering an extensive range of integrated, smart and e-mobility solutions.

M&M’s overall auto volume for August grew 93 percent on-year to 59,049 units. Its PV volume grew 87 percent YoY, while CV sales grew 143 percent YoY. Demand across the portfolio remains strong and is enhanced with blockbuster launches of Scorpio-N, Scorpio Classic and new Bolero MaXX Pik-up.

Blockbuster launch of its ‘Scorpio-N’ has received 100,000 bookings under 30 minutes, translating into an ex-showroom value of Rs18,000 crore. Its commercial vehicle segment continues to deliver strong growth across segments.

M&M has an ambitious plan of launching 23 new products by 2026. Within its passenger vehicle business, it plans to launch 9 new products while for its LCV business it plans 14 new products by 2026.

"" M&M has been very proactive with EV space, which seems to be a reality in the coming years. M&M has the highest share of the diesel portfolio & its ownership and operational cost has increased significantly in the recent past, putting the company at a disadvantageous position,"" Aditya Birla Capital said.

For Tata Motors, analysts expect a potential slowdown likely to impact key markets like US, Europe and China of Tata Motors JLR segment.

Tata Motors India sold a total of 78,658 units of vehicles in August 2022, which grew by 36.1 percent on-year, while declined by 3.7 percent a month ago. Total domestic sales were at 76,479 units, up 41 percent YoY and down 3 percent MoM,

""Tata Motors has continued to see strong growth in domestic PV sales on the back of a strong order pipeline. Tata Motors has gained domestic PV market share in Q1FY23 and is working on continuing the trend. The YoY growth rates in the domestic CV segment have started to normalize from July 2022 as the effect of the covid-impacted low base is reducing. Demand traction in CVs continues due to the Government’s push on infrastructure, higher levels of economic activity, reopening of schools and offices, and growth in the agriculture and e-commerce sectors,"" a KR Choksey report said."

The government should not be running businesses as public sector companies are inefficient and do not generate enough resources to fund their own growth, according to Maruti Suzuki India Chairman R C Bhargava.

Public sector companies need support all the time to grow and need funds from the government for capital investments, he told PTI in an interview.

""I have no doubt that government should not be in business. No way,"" he said when asked if governments should be in the business of running enterprises on the basis of his experience of witnessing the transformation of the then government-owned Maruti Udyog Ltd to Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, majority owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corporation. He further said, ""The fact of the matter is that companies run by the government are not efficient. They don't have productivity. They don't generate profit. They don't generate resources. They don't grow. They need government support all the time to grow."" There are not many ""public sector companies which have grown from internal resources. For most capital investments they need to get funds from the government. You can't have industrial growth from taxation, period!"", Bhargava asserted.

Industrial growth has to come from internal resource generation, he said, adding a company must create wealth and not be a wealth eroder.

""That's the point. Public sector companies have not been wealth creators...If the fundamental point of wealth creation is not met, you have a system in place which is going to be a losing system. The country is going to lose because you're taking away money from the taxpayers to support this inefficient working,"" Bhargava said.

A public sector firm is also handicapped by the entire environment, such as the limitation of being an instrument of state under the Constitution, as a result of which all the fundamental rights in the Constitution were enforceable against the company, he said, citing the example of Maruti before privatisation.

""There were so many, what I would say, non-value adding activities which one had to do, which interfered and added costs for what we're doing and prevented us going forward,"" Bhargava said, recollecting how the then Maruti Udyog Ltd had to deal with several parliamentary committees, comply with the Official Languages Act with people having to learn to type on both Hindi and English typewriters.

Bhargava, however, said the failure of public sector is not unique to India and has happened elsewhere such as Russia, the UK, France and Japan, where ""everybody is getting out of public sector."""

The recall is being undertaken to replace the airbag control unit, free of cost, in these vehicles, the company said.

It is suspected that there is a possible defect in Airbag Control Unit, which in the rare cases might result in malfunctioning during deployment, it said.

The carmaker has advised customers of suspected vehicles to not drive or use the vehicle till the replacement is done.

Affected vehicle owners will be receiving communication from Maruti Suzuki authorized workshops for the replacement.

With the month of June seeing a revival in sales in the domestic car market, the month of July saw the industry sustaining the growth momentum despite supply chain challenges. The key reason for sales growth was a further reduction in the waiting period of key models, coupled with multiple roll-outs by top car-manufacturing companies.

The country’s largest passenger vehicle-maker, Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL), has registered total sales of 175,916 in July 2022. The company reported a growth of 6.8 percent in domestic passenger vehicle sales at 142,850 units, compared to 133,732 units sold in the year-ago period.

While revealing the sales numbers, MSIL claimed that the shortage of electronic components had a minor impact on the production of vehicles, mainly in domestic models, and the company took all possible measures to minimise the impact.

Likewise, Hyundai has reported a 6 percent rise in total sales at 63,851 units in July 2022 vis-à-vis 60,249 units sold in the same month last year. In the domestic market, the Korean carmaker sold 50,500 units in July 2022, against 48,042 units sold in July 2021, thus registering a 5.1 percent growth. The company’s exports grew 9.4 per cent at 13,351 units, compared to 12,207 units in the same month last year.

“With the improvement in the semiconductor situation, the passenger vehicle segment is showing positive trends riding on the green shoots of pent-up demand and customer desire towards personal mobility,” HMIL Director (Sales, Marketing & Service) Tarun Garg said.

Tata Motors has reported a whopping 57 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in July 2022, selling 47,505 units in the home market, compared to 30,185 units in July 2021. Unsurprisingly, SUV sales accounted for 64 percent of total sales – a YoY sales growth of 105 per cent. Furthermore, it has sold 4,022 electric cars in July 2022, which is a 566 percent growth over the 604 units sold last year.

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) reported a 33 percent growth in numbers, as its total passenger vehicle sales in the domestic market stood at 28,053 in July 2022, against 21,046 in the same month last year. India’s largest utility vehicle-maker sold 27,854 SUVs, compared to 20,797 units in the same period last year, registering a growth of 34 percent. However, its cars and vans saw a degrowth of 20 percent from 249 units last year to 199 units this year.

Commenting on the sales, Veejay Nakra, President, Automotive Division, M&M Ltd, said, “We continued our strong performance with sales of 27,854 SUVs in July, registering a growth of 34 percent, fuelled by robust demand for all our brands, including XUV700, Thar, Bolero and XUV300. The supply chain situation continues to remain dynamic, and we are monitoring the situation closely.”

Kia India too recorded monthly domestic sales of 22,022 units in July 2022, registering a 46.66 percent YoY growth from 15,016 units in the same month last year. Kia Seltos and Sonet, with sales of 8,451 and 7,215 units respectively, led the sales momentum for the brand, followed by Carens with 5,978 units and Carnival with 288 units. The company claims that the brand continues to be among the five best-selling car brands in the country.

Commenting on the performance, Hardeep Singh Brar, Vice President & Head of Sales and Marketing, Kia India, said, “Gradual improvement in the supply chain and our customers’ continued love for the brand are adding momentum to Kia India’s growth. With the upcoming festival season, we shall strive to improve supplies to give faster deliveries to our customers. To ensure minimum wait time, we have been running our production facility at full capacity since February 2022 with utmost optimisation.”"

""On the ground, demand looks strong,"" said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director (ED), Marketing & Sales, Maruti Suzuki, told CNBC-TV 18 on June 22.

Srivastava, however, flagged rising interest rates that have made loans expensive, soaring fuel prices, inflation and high commodity prices, which have now begun to cool, as obstacles to growth.

Citing the 13.5 percent industry growth rate in the passenger vehicle segment in FY 22, Srivastava said absolute volume sales remain comparable to FY 17, reflecting pent-up demand.

""The industry is expecting a double-digit growth with targeted sales of 34 to 35 lakh units,"" he said.

On the semiconductor shortage that has hit production, Srivastava said the company was producing at 95 percent capacity, a marked improvement over the 40 percent capacity in September 2021.

""I’m a little apprehensive to give an exact date because things are fluid and we don't have visibility of semiconductor availability for a long time in the future,"" Srivastava said.

The automotive company saw its market share rise to an all-time high of 67 percent in the non-SUV segment, while its overall share remains below 50 percent.

“In the SUV segment, while in the industry there are 47-48 models, we have only two—Brezza and S-Cross. Clearly, we need to strengthen our portfolio in the SUV segment and that’s what we intend to do going forward,” he said.

The operating margins for the company fell to a historic low of 6 percent in FY 22. ""We are not at the level of profitability which we had seen during the peak of 2017-18,” the ED said, referring to a spike in commodity prices hitting the margins.

The price hikes taken by Maruti and others had not been able to offset the rise in commodity prices, he said. ""Steel is trading at Rs 68-70 per kg, and has come down from highs of Rs 84 but still well above the Rs 38 a kg it was trading at two years ago,"" he added.

The company has no plans to bring forward the rollout of its electric vehicle planned for FY24. ""Launch of EV is not about putting a vehicle out there, but to make sure that the consumers who buy it are not inconvenienced by the lack of charging infrastructure,"" Srivastava said.

Speaking about the falling Yen, he said it was positive news for the company as it relies on imports from that country.

The rupee has fallen 3-4 percent against the US dollar as compared to the Yen, which has shed 11-12 percent in recent weeks. The gains from the fall in Yen, however, would depend on other distribution factors, he said."

That’s the kind of delays car buyers in India are facing owing to unprecedented disruption in global supply chains, including an acute shortage of semiconductor chips.

Global supply chains had taken a hit when the COVID-19 pandemic started and the problems have only continued, thanks to the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the resurgence of coronavirus cases in China.

“The primary reason (for the delay is) the supply side challenges due to shortages of semiconductors. These challenges are likely to continue for some time,” said Rajesh Menon, director general of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, or SIAM.

The delay in getting delivery of vehicles is mostly in the premium vehicles and compact SUV segment. According to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), apart from the XUV700, bestsellers such as Hyundai Creta or Venue (new version coming soon), Maruti Suzuki Ertiga, Mahindra Thar and Venue are seeing waiting periods of at least six months.

However, a few models, especially in the hatchback or sedan segment such as Hyundai Grand i10 Nios or Santro, Maruti Suzuki Celerio or WagonR, Tata Tigor, are available in one or two months.

Experts said that the chip shortage is expected to extend into 2023, so there seems to be no immediate relief in sight for car buyers.

OEMs saddled with unmet demand

According to ICRA, lower production levels have led to unusually high waiting periods for many popular vehicles. Even as inventory levels across dealerships have started inching upwards, they continue to remain lower than normal at around 15-20 days, as per ICRA. Typically, dealers hold inventory of 25-30 days.

While the delays in taking delivery of a vehicle is unusually high, customers seem to be willing to wait as the demand for personal mobility in the wake of the pandemic has increased. While the cancellation rate of booked vehicles has inched up from around the 5-6 percent during pre-pandemic times to now 8-9 percent now, according to Vinkesh Gulati, President of FADA, demand remains strong.

Car market leader Maruti Suzuk's bookings and inquiries remain robust. However, with supply-side constraints, it has seen pending bookings pile up and waiting periods going up. As of date, the company has around 325,000 pending bookings.

“The waiting periods for different models are different not only brand-wise but also fuel type-wise. The waiting period for CNG vehicles is generally much higher than non-CNG vehicles. The Ertiga CNG, for example, has almost an eight-month waiting period. On the other hand, (that for) the gasoline version of the S-Presso is a lot less. The supply-side constraint is largely because of semiconductor components rather than assembly capacity constraints,” said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki.

Likewise, Hyundai Motor India said it is holding more than 120,000 pending customer bookings across its model range. The South Korean carmaker claimed that the average waiting period on Hyundai products is around five to six months and varies across the Creta (eight months), Alcazar (four to five months), Venue (three to four months) and new i20 (four to five months).

At a recent press conference, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) revealed that it has seen unprecedented demand for its SUVs including the Thar and XUV700. The total number of bookings across its SUV range is over 170,000. While some of its brands including the Thar have a waiting period of six to nine months, the XUV700 has a relatively higher waiting period of 18-24 months, depending on the variant.

“We have taken several steps such as building greater fungibility, creating alternative sources for chips and ramping up capacity to mitigate the impact,” said Veejay Nakra, president of M&M’s automotive division.

A Tata Motors spokesperson, too, said the waiting period for some of its models was as high as four months for some variants.

As per ICRA, the production levels of OEMs are expected to remain impacted to an extent by the continuation of the chip supply shortage, with new capacities expected to come on board only in CY2023.

“Leading players across the value chain had already guided production shortfalls for 2022. As a result of the geopolitical uncertainty emanating from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and recent lockdowns in China, the supply shortage is now expected to extend well into 2023, with new capacities for chip manufacturers only likely to commence production in 2023,"" said Rohan Kanwar Gupta, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited​."

Not its mileage or its affordability factor; this time around Maruti Suzuki is promoting its commercial channel with ‘Tarakki Aapki Saath Hamara’. A significant departure from the ‘Kitna deti hain’ and 'Papa petrol khatam hi ni hunda' campaign era.

The auto major’s latest 360 degree media campaign aims to spread awareness about Maruti Suzuki Commercial as the one-stop solution of customers’ business needs and its product range of both goods as well as passenger carriers.

This is the first-ever brand campaign for the segment and the first of many such media campaigns Maruti plans to launch this year.

There was no better time to launch a campaign, Shashank Srivastava, senior executive director, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki, says in an exclusive interaction with Storyboard18.

“After many years the commercial vehicle segment has started going up again,” Srivastava says.

The period from 2018-2019 was the peak, when about a million commercial vehicles were sold. Then it came down to 7.17 lakh the following year and went on to hit a low of 5.68 lakh commercial vehicles 2020-2021. This year, however, Srivastava says, they have seen “good growth across segments and we expect that the commercial vehicle space will grow further during the year. This was perfect timing for the campaign.”

The commercial channel at Maruti reported over 39% sales growth in FY 2021.

Partners on the road to success

The campaign ‘Tarakki Aapki, Saath Hamara’, according to Srivastava, recognizes the drive of customers in this segment to be financially successful and socially recognized.

""These customers need a reliable and trustworthy partner to guide in their decision-making. This is where Maruti Suzuki Commercial steps in to offer them products that help them succeed,"" he says, on the genesis of the campaign. It addresses commercial channel customers who are primarily a mix of ‘owner-cum-driver’ and fleet owners.

Maruti Suzuki Commercial was launched in 2016 and now has over 340 showrooms in 230 cities. The first ever campaign to popularise this offering from the brand is being launched through TVCs, radio, OOH and digital platforms.

Bollywood actors Aparshakti Khurana and Manav Kaul have been roped in to be the face of the campaign that showcases the day-to-day business challenges and solutions offered by the brand at different touchpoints.

Bigger targets and big ticket media spends

Maruti Suzuki India, which has 22% (40% in the CNG category) market share in the commercial segment, is ready for the next level of growth in the overall category. Naturally, marketing and advertising spends are also going up for the auto major.

Maruti Suzuki India spent Rs 700 crore as marketing expenses last year out of which Rs600 crore was their overall media spends. Srivastava says the spending is going to go up in 2022 by anywhere between 10% and 15%.

The ad expenditure according to him for auto brands are in four categories: The biggest expenditure goes towards communication around new brand launches followed by communication around existing brands. The third is a lower end of the funnel activity where you need to do conversion from inquiries to the actual retail, and that requires a lot of ad support. The fourth expenditure is on corporate advertising, which includes advertising which is not related to one particular brand but to one aspect of the business. For example, it could be technology, it could be fuel efficiency and others.

“We expect new launches to take place in 2022, we expect sustenance expenditure to go up, we expect the conversion door and funnel ad expenditure to go up and finally on the corporate side too there will be plenty of campaigns. The commercial channel campaign is just the beginning of it. So overall our media spending in 2022 would increase on all these four accounts,” Srivastava adds.

Approximately 25-27% of the media spend would go towards digital, 5-7% towards Out of Home advertising and 30-35% would go towards print and television.

The electric future and barriers to penetration

Given the increasing buzz around electric vehicles and new launches, we ask Srivastava whether Maruti will ride the EV wave in India soon?

While several rumours around Maruti’s first SUV electric vehicle and its hinted launch in 2025 are doing the rounds, Srivastava feels that the Indian buyer suffers from “range anxiety”.

“There is not enough charging infrastructure in the country. The consumers are always anxious about the range of kilometers that they can run with the balance charge that they have. This is what we call range anxiety and this anxiousness prevents the consumers from purchasing an EV,” he tells us.

Also read: Delhi govt receives 12 bids to install 100 EV charging stations

The other big reason why EV sales are not picking up in the country, Srivastava says, is because of the premium pricing of the vehicles. “The cost is high because the current battery technology that's available, makes it difficult to price EVs in a manner which can be easily purchased by the consumers, the cost of acquisition will continue to remain high and that is one barrier to penetration,” he says.

Srivastava gives us a glimpse of how the auto major views on the road to an electric future in India. “In order to bring the cost of acquisition down for EVs, we need to localize a lot of parts and look at hybrid technology. Hybrid technology is something which does not require the charging infrastructure and at the same time, they give a very good fuel efficiency. They are also very good for the environment. So the hybrid is the route we believe to electrification in the country and that's what I think is the sustainable model for business in the sector for EVs.”

He points out how out of a total of close to 31 lakh passenger vehicles sold in 2021, only 5,500 were electric vehicles.

However, Srivastava also feels that going forward, widespread usage and acceptability of EVs will take place. “There will be a point of time when the EV sales will suddenly shoot up and this will be in response to both the running cost of EVs being lower and also the fact that the governments across the world are going to be more stringent on the environment front,” he says.

“So the question,"" he adds, ""is not whether but when.”"

"May 30, 2021 10:41 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/automobile/is-hydrogen-really-the-way-forward-for-trucks-6960731.html,"The last week has marked some significant developments in the world of heavy-duty transport, which, much like the private vehicle sector, is undergoing tectonic change. Unlike private cars, which are looking at rapid and total electrification in the near future, long-haul truck makers are keener on using hydrogen as a renewable energy source. The primary reason for this is that hydrogen is more suited to consistently long-distance, cross-country journeys that heavy-duty trucks have to undertake.

In the span of a week, Daimler Trucks has announced that it will be focussing on hydrogen-powered fuel cells for its long-haul trucks with a functional prototype already deployed for rigorous field testing. The prototype of Mercedes-Benz’s GenH2 truck, which was unveiled last October, is expected to be tested on public roads very soon, although its series-production debut isn’t expected until 2027. Daimler is one of many European truck makers under pressure to develop hydrogen technology, with Sweden’s Volvo and Italy’s Iveco also doubling down on electrifying

Hyundai Motors, however, is one step ahead. With an existing hydrogen-powered truck in their fleet, Hyundai has announced plans to ship the Xcient Fuel Cell truck to Europe by the fourth quarter, this year. Hyundai’s road-ready fuel cell truck will already be on the frontline of testing the efficacy of hydrogen as an energy source for long-haul while European truck makers are still in the prototype stage.

This is largely thanks to Hyundai Hydrogen Solutions, a joint venture between Hyundai and Swiss hydrogen energy company H2. For its part, Daimler AG has launched a joint venture with Volvo trucks, called “Cellcentric”, which intends to develop hydrogen fuel cells for large trucks, while also working on battery-electric trucks, carrying lower cargo weights, that will be used for shorter routes.

Why Hydrogen? According to David Cullen, a scientist studying fuel cell catalysts at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the US, “Hydrogen fuel cells are ideal for the trucking industry because the refueling time and driving range are comparable to gasoline-powered trucks and travel routes are predictable, which lowers the barrier for developing a fueling infrastructure”. As such, Europe is looking at a hydrogen-powered freight corridor, stretching roughly 1300km, to be fully functional by 2025.

Studies conducted by ORNL also claim that “hydrogen fuel cells contain a higher amount of energy-per-unit mass than a lithium battery or diesel fuel”. Simply put, this enables a long-haul, heavy-duty truck to pack more energy without the added weight that would come from a lithium ion-sourced energy equivalent.

Then there’s the fact that the time needed to fill up a truck with onboard hydrogen is on par with ICE cars and requires a lot less time than charging the battery fit for a long-haul cargo truck. Extended charging times can delay payload delivery, thereby reducing the sector’s efficiency which would cost money.

Given that heavy-duty transport contributes heavily towards greenhouse emissions, and relies predominantly on diesel, it makes sense that the hydrogen offensive starts with big trucks. A kilogram of hydrogen has the same energy density as 3.7 litres of diesel.

Is hydrogen truly a zero-emission source of energy?

The European Commission, in an official communique addressed to the EU, breaks down the various means through which hydrogen can be obtained. Out of these “Fossil-based hydrogen” which is derived via natural gas or coal creates harmful emissions which only add to the carbon footprint. They’re also highly dependent on natural gas prices, and the fact that it’s a depleting energy resource hasn’t helped further the cause of hydrogen.

The only viable way forward is if hydrogen is extracted via clean, renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Neither of these sources, according to the document, are cost-competitive against fossil-based hydrogen, costing about twice as much per kilogram, in Europe.

The abundance of hydrogen by itself is no guarantee that it’s synthesis as a fuel will be just as easy. This isn’t to say that the lithium-ion battery production process is completely clean. The production of both these zero-emission sources of energy comes at the cost of CO2 emissions.

Why are we not using hydrogen to power passenger cars?

However, hydrogen’s place in the road transport ecosystem requires some reconsideration since it’s a far more sustainable option in the long run than EVs. And given the extensive charging times required for EVs, it’s also more practical. In the case of hydrogen fuel cell cars, hydrogen and oxygen combine to create electric power, thereby giving the vehicle the same performance advantage as EVs.

However, heavy reliance on natural gas and the high cost of renewable hydrogen has kept the costs of hydrogen EVs very high. The hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai costs approximately Rs18 lakh more than a Tesla Model 3.

As a result, the infrastructure required to sustain widespread usage of hydrogen EVs remains woefully underdeveloped across all European countries. As a result, a major chunk of investment money has gone into funding EV startups, because EVs, although a stopgap measure in the larger scheme of things are the immediate future. According to Howden, a renewable energy solutions provider in the US, over 80% of leaders in the car manufacturing industry identify FCEVs as the most likely solution for long-range mobility in the near future.

The Forecast

The only ray of hope lies in the fact that both Europe and China are competing to build a world-leading industry around hydrogen technology. And the resulting competition is likely to drive down prices.

India too is considering focussing on green hydrogen. According to CNBC, Fusion Fuel Green, an Ireland-based green hydrogen technology company, has signed an agreement with BGR Energy Systems, a Chennai-based engineering firm, to set up a solar-powered hydrogen manufacturing unit in India.

Last November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also quoted saying that India will launch a “comprehensive National Hydrogen Energy Mission” A recent report by The Energy and Resource Institute (TERI) also highlighted India’s potential in being a green energy solutions provider, predicting that “by 2050, 80% of India’s hydrogen will be produced by renewable electricity and electrolysis”."

Highlights:

- Economy is opening up slowly so is the pick up in automobile sales- The tractors segment, however, continues to do well

--------------------------------------------------

Auto companies had come under tremendous pressure due to the COVID-19 outbreak as the production got halted and dealerships had to be closed down. The lockdown, however, was eased in May to kickstart the economy and auto companies started opening up manufacturing facilities slowly and a few of the dealerships also started. But, people continue to be cautious to step out to spend on discretionary items such as automobiles.

Segment-wise commercial vehicle manufacturers posted a decline in the range of 70 percent to 90 percent, the passenger car segment declined more than 80 percent and the two-wheeler segment declined in the range of 60-83 percent. Exports have also witnessed a decline in the range of 50-80 percent.

What continues to do well in terms of monthly numbers is the tractor segment. Escorts posted a meagre decline of 0.5 percent on year-on-year (YoY) basis and M&M witnessed a YoY decline of 1.5 percent. The numbers came at 6,454 and 24,341 units in the month of May 2020, respectively.

Outlook

The road ahead would continue to be challenging for auto companies as they need to maintain social distancing both in factories and dealerships.

We believe that the demand for the commercial vehicle (CV) segment would pick up slowly as it is directly correlated with the economy.

One of the most important changes we will see in a post-COVID-19 world is a shift towards personal transport as people may continue to be wary of public transport. Two wheelers and passenger vehicles are likely to see a significant pick-up in demand. Here too, affordability matters, as the threat of job losses looms large in several sectors.

BS-VI implementation is also a challenge for auto majors as the cost of ownership is expected to rise which may thwart demand recovery.

Lastly, higher reservoir levels, adequate soil moisture condition, a good Rabi crop and normal monsoons augur well for tractor demand in the next few months.

"May 25, 2020 07:09 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hyundai-india-maruti-workers-get-coronavirus-showing-restart-risks-5310451.html,"Workers at two of India’s biggest carmakers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus days after restarting operations, exposing the risks companies and the government face in kickstarting the economy.

Three employees at Hyundai Motor Co’s Indian plant have tested positive for the virus, the South Korean automaker said on Sunday.

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, which sells one in every two cars in the country, said late on Saturday one employee at its plant in the northern city of Manesar had tested positive and there was the possibility of a second case.

The cases show the risks and challenges Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government faces in restarting automobile production in an effort to revive the economy after a near two-month lockdown to fight the spread of the coronavirus.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Maruti, majority owned by Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corp, said there was no impact on business operations. The carmaker restarted work at its Manesar plant earlier in May.

Hyundai, which restarted operations at its plant on the outskirts of the southern city of Chennai on May 8, said the three employees started showing mild symptoms of coughs and colds in the first week.

“All the necessary measures are being taken for contact tracing, self-isolation and complete sanitation,” Hyundai’s India spokesman said in a statement.

Test results of sixteen more workers who possibly came into contact with the infected employees are expected over the next two days, a senior government official told Reuters.

“The state’s policy is to not let the industry stall,” said P Ponniah, the top bureaucrat in the Kancheepuram district where Hyundai’s plant is located.

He said parts of the plant visited by the employees would be sanitised, a process likely to take 3-4 days during which time staff would be barred from those areas.

Hyundai’s employees union has written to management and the Tamil Nadu state government, urging the company to immediately test all workers at its own expense, president E Muthukumar told Reuters."

Auto companies have come under tremendous pressure due to the COVID-19 outbreak as production halted and dealerships had to be closed down. The complete lockdown in April led to companies reporting zero sales in the domestic market.

Tractor manufacturers though saw some sales in the domestic market. However, the numbers are much lower compared to a year ago. Escorts and M&M sold 613 and 4,772 units in the month, respectively. Though the numbers are lower by 87.7 percent and 83.3 percent respectively from a year ago.

Their daily schedules have been disrupted and their long drawn out usual meetings have been replaced by video calls. Not to mention the stress of a looming economic slowdown and pressure from investors.

Moneycontrol looks at how a scrum of business leaders is dealing with these fast changing times. In today’s edition of Virtual Leaders Rakesh Khar spoke to Maruti Chairman RC Bhargava.

You can read other editions of Virtual Leaders here.

Edited excerpts:

Q: What does your average day look like in view of the disruption?A: Personally, there is not much of a difference. I have been as busy at home as ever. I am not bored. I am enjoying it. The only difference is that the review meetings that I used to do from office have been replaced by home video conferences. In view of the lockdown, the work from home has actually increased.

Q: How is that?A: We are trying to shift gears to produce ventilators and person protection equipment (PPE) to aid the nation in the ongoing health emergency. This is being executed through our vendors. But it has taken a lot of time is securing the requisite clearances to set up a new product line. The ventilator vendor used to produce 300 to 400 pieces a year and now we hope to do around 400 pieces a day. Similarly, for manufacturing PPEs, we are currently in the process of setting up the protocol. We have the manpower and our seat producing vendors are adapting themselves to prescribed standards for PPE manufacture.

Q: How do you see the corner office in times of COVID-19 and beyond?A: To some extent, we will have to go back to the old system. But the lockdown has shown us a new way to conduct business. Even if we are in office, we will connect for meetings more and more virtually. Data capability will, of course, be a key factor. There is an industry skew as well, work from home syndrome is more efficient perhaps for ITIS and ITES business verticals. A company like Maruti has lesser scope for work from home syndrome. Yes, our materials, finance, and HR verticals - to some extent - can transact business digitally but production has to stay invested in the factory premises.

Q: Now that you are working from home, have you been able to connect with friends, acquaintances that you had not spoken for long?A: I have been an early practitioner of work from home. My day is choker block full of calls, video conferences, and review presentations. I have not necessarily been indulging in any free time. My movie time has not increased either.

Q: How has the family taken to you being home for such a long time?A: My wife, who used to have her own work schedule outside of the home, is now at home. In that sense, we do get to spend more time together.

Q: Technology adaptation is a key challenge while working from home. What are your preferred tools to stay connected?A: I have over the past few weeks used a variety of tools. All of them are good. It is as good as meeting the individual in person. The only challenge is the bandwidth. There is need to ramp it up to sustain the quality of signal.

Q: What is one big piece of management learning you have gained during the work from home?A: There is phenomenal learning in terms of saving management time, saving costs and improving efficiency, leading to better productivity. For example, if I have a meeting to attend in Mumbai, it takes away two days. Now with the demonstrated audio video capability to connect, meetings can be done in real time. This will cut down heavily on travel and lodging costs."

On the lines of General Motors and Ford in the US, India’s automotive giants such as Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra & Mahindra are stepping in to help produce critical medical equipment and supplies.

Car market leader Maruti Suzuki (MSIL) will assist three different companies in producing ventilators, masks, and protective clothing the Delhi-based company informed on March 28.

“At the request of the Government of India, Maruti Suzuki examined its ability to assist in the production of ventilators, masks and other protective equipment”, the company said in a statement.

MSIL entered into an arrangement with AgVa Healthcare, an existing approved manufacturer of ventilators. MSIL would work with AgVa Healthcare to scale up the production of ventilators to reach a volume of 10,000 units per month.

AgVa Healthcare would be responsible for the technology, performance and related matters for all the ventilators produced and sold by them. MSIL would use its suppliers to produce the required volume of components and use its experience and knowledge to upgrade systems for the production and quality control of the higher volumes.

“MSIL would also help, to the required extent to arrange financing, and obtain all permissions and approvals required to enable the higher production. MSIL would provide these services free of cost to AgVa Healthcare,” Maruti added.

Krishna Maruti, a joint venture of MSIL with Ashok Kapur the founder of Krishna Group, would be manufacturing 3-ply masks for supply to the Haryana and Central governments. Production is expected to start as soon as all approvals are received. Kapur will provide 2 million masks free of cost as his own contribution.

Bharat Seats, a joint venture of MSIL with the Relan family, would be manufacturing protective clothing as soon as all approvals are in place.

Two days ago the Mahindra Group said that it is working on a very affordable version of the ventilator costing less than Rs 7,500 as against the typical cost of Rs 5-7 lakh. A prototype is expected to get ready in three days.

The Mumbai-based group is simultaneously working with the indigenous makers of ICU ventilators."

For example, for an entry-level car costing Rs 4.5 lakh on road, the out-of-pocket down payment by customers may reduce by half from 20 percent to 10 percent, i.e. Rs 40,000-45,000.

This is presently a pilot project, effective from January 1 to March 31, Shashank Srivastava, Director (marketing & sales) at Maruti Suzuki, told the paper. The automaker is in talks with at least four to five other major banks for similar schemes, he added.

Srivastava added that the initiative would “revive the industry” by reducing the burden that the customers, especially those buying entry-level vehicles, face due to high vehicle cost and enhanced down payment obligations. “Down payment will be lowered by 5-10 percent of on-road price through this,” he told TOI.

Within the current framework, banks finance 80 percent of the vehicle’s on-road price, while the rest has to be paid upfront by the customer. With car prices on the rise and the tight financial situation, the burden on customers has increased as banks try to stave off freely lending."

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked former MD of Maruti Suzuki Jagdish Khattar for allegedly defrauding Punjab National Bank of Rs 110 crore.

The agency booked a case against Khattar, his company Carnation (which Khattar started after leaving Maruti in 2007) and other unknown persons under criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal misconduct, ANI reported.

An IAS officer who rose to climb the rungs to become the MD of Maruti Udyog in 1999, when it was a government enterprise.

Suzuki retained him as MD after Maruti's privatisation in 2002, and helped the company stave off stiff competition from foreign auto companies that were setting up base in India.

Khattar retired from Maruti at age 65. After this, he started Carnation, a multi-brand car sales and service network.

Carnation was backed by marquee private equity investors such as Premji Invest but its business model, which underwent several changes, failed.

In 2017, the company was put under bankruptcy proceedings by PNB. In 2018, the brand along with some of its assets was acquired by Mahindra First Choice.

Jagdish Khattar, in a statement, said, ""Carnation was a board managed company with the highest ethical standards and best management practices. Some of the most reputed investors in the country including Premji Invest and Gaja Capital were board members who, in their own interest, kept a tight vigil on its operations and finances. Each financial decision was based on comprehensive business plans and approvals. The company was finally sold to Mahindra Group. Post its failure as a business, an exhaustive and detailed independent forensic audit at the behest of the bankers under the resolution professional was conducted by a leading independent auditor and nothing was found amiss. Having found no lapses in operations or financial management the Bank has referred the matter to CBI as a part of the process followed by them. The company has not indulged in any wrongdoing. A search was conducted by CBI but nothing incriminating was found.""

""I had invested my life savings in the company. I understand the bank is following a process. I have always made myself available and will continue to fully cooperate with all the agencies. The claims being made were examined in great detail during the forensic audit and we provided satisfactory replies on each. We were cleared in the forensic audit on each count. I have no doubt we will be vindicated again once the investigation is completed,"" he said."

Maruti Suzuki India has hired consultants KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for advice on mitigating impact of the downturn in the auto sector, reports Mint.

The consultations would include bettering operations and improving efficiency for the passenger vehicle market, the article quoted sources as saying. The move indicates the management’s resolve to tide over the storm and reveals that it does not view the slowdown as short term.

Both consultancies had in a Maruti Suzuki Suppliers Welfare Association meeting on September 11 shared measures with vendors for managing the crisis and also outlined reasons for the slowdown, the report said.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

PwC was chosen because it has experience advising European auto part makers during the economic downturn in 2008-10. “Suppliers have been the biggest casualty of the slowdown as most of them had to retrench a lot of their employees to reduce operational cost. This also shows the maturity of Maruti as a company as well,"" the article quotes a source as saying.

Reeling under a severe slowdown, it had reduced its production by 33.99 percent in August, making it the seventh straight month that India's largest carmaker reduced its output.

It produced a total of 111,370 units in August as against 168,725 units in the year-ago month, Maruti said in an exchange filing on September 2.

The company also cut its temporary workforce in August by over 3,000. RC Bhargava, its Chairman, attributed the job cuts to the ongoing slump in the automobile industry. ""Permanent workers have not been impacted, but contracts of the temporary workers were not renewed due to the slowdown,"" he said."

Highlights:

- Disappointing set of numbers from auto majors in all segments

- New axle load norms, tight liquidity and non-availability of finance weigh on CVs

- Lower Rabi sowing than expected pushed down tractors sales

- Two-wheeler and passenger vehicle segments continue to disappoint

- A rate cut in the upcoming RBI policy meet may act as a catalyst for the sector --------------------------------------------------

Indian automobile industry continues to falter, as is evident from May sales numbers. Demand remains soft because of multiple headwinds the industry is facing, including increase in cost of ownership due to mandatory long-term insurance, tighter safety norms, non-availability of retail finance and moderate economic activity because of the just-finished elections.

Segment-wise, commercial vehicle (CV) numbers fell short of the crease for all the automakers. Operating environment continues to be tough for a myriad reasons. Liquidity crunch, the lagged impact of new axle load norms and slowdown in economic activity all have affected demand. Tractor segment is also losing steam, thanks to last year’s higher base and subdued farm sentiment.

Ditto for three-wheeler (3W) sales, which are feeling the pinch from a very high base last year. Two-wheeler volumes are no better, hit by a confluence of adverse factors.

What could act as a catalyst for the industry is lowering of interest rates by the RBI in its upcoming policy review on June 6. A rate cut would help improve economic activity, boosting auto demand.

Commercial vehicles – No respiteThe economic downturn and stagnant industrial output coupled with the liquidity, financing and regulatory issues have dampened customer demand for CVs. The companies expect the demand to recover, post-election.

Company-wise, Tata Motors registered a decline of 24 percent year-on-year (YoY) in CV volume, hurt by 32.4 percent fall in medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs). Eicher Volvo also saw a drop of 16.3 percent. M&M monthly volume came down by 2 percent, with significant softness in M&HCV segment playing out. Ashok Leyland was on the same boat, logging a decline of 4 percent. However, the slide was arrested by a significant jump of 30.5 percent in LCV segment.

Car segment stays under pressurePassenger vehicle segment continues to be under immense pressure, with no visible signs of recovery. Negative sentiment is mostly an upshot of high finance cost and regulatory headwinds. That explains the lower PV volume for May.

Volume for the market leader, Maruti, was down 23 percent for the month. The management expects the demand to be muted in H1 FY20 which could recover only in H2 FY20 and witness 4-5 percent growth for the whole financial year. Tata Motors’ passenger car space paints a similar picture, down 37 percent YoY. UV segment, however, continues to put up a strong show, racking up 12.7 percent growth for May. M&M had to suffer a decline of 0.5 percent in its monthly volume.

Rougher ride for two-wheelers (2W)Two-wheeler space has been the worst hit in the auto space, given a very weak consumer sentiment. Hero, the leader in the space, put up with a significant decline of 7.7 percent. Eicher, the leader in premium bike segment, too took a beating of 16.5 percent in its monthly sales. Bajaj Auto, on the other hand, bucked the trend, notching up 6.8 percent growth in volume on the back of aggressive pricing at the entry level segment, which helped it capture Hero’s market share. TVS sales fell 1 percent in May.

Three-wheeler (3W): Soft numbersThe overall 3W market felt the heat in May. TVS posted a growth of 9 percent and M&M 4.9 percent. Bajaj Auto, the leader of the pack, registered a decline of 6.2 percent, chiefly because of high base last year.

Tractors: Blame it on Rabi sowingTractor segment ran out of gas as Rabi sowing came in lower than expected and farm sentiment remained depressed. While Escorts numbers fell significantly by 22.1 percent, M&M’s fall in volumes stood at 15.8 percent. The management expects that the government focus on agri initiatives coupled with a near-normal monsoon forecast by IMD would stoke tractor demand in the near future.

Exports in troubled watersExports are turning negative, with many countries facing multiple challenges. Several factors like drop in retail sales in Bangladesh and Nepal, high stock in the SAARC region and slump in the Middle-East have affected the overall industry volumes in these markets.

Barring Bajaj Auto, Escorts and TVS, exports for all auto majors contracted in May.

If May 17 move was any indication to go by, one could have taken very important cues from the market move that day.

After moving within the much-anticipated range of 11,300 and 11,150 for most of the last week, the bulls finally succeeded in taking control of the higher territory. The support of 11,150 was the change in polarity top formed in February 2019.

On Bank Nifty, the RSI did take support at 40 on the daily chart, thus bouncing the index from that level to its previous high of 30,900.

Most sectors have given a huge move on the upside, thanks to the multiple signs of support, either on price or momentum or both. The auto sector seems to be leading the pack. Stocks including Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland and Hero MotoCorp seem to be poised for a good move in the coming week.

Maruti Suzuki: Buy | Target: Rs 7,850 | Stop loss: Below Rs 6,650

Maruti Suzuki Limited – Weekly Chart

Last week, Maruti once again formed the bullish candle pattern at trendline support, with RSI took support at 40 level. The stock gives a good opportunity to buy on a dip to Rs 6,900 for a stop loss below Rs 6,650 for a target of Rs 7,850.

Ashok Leyland: Buy | Target: Rs 95.50 | Stop loss: Below Rs 83.50

Ashok Leyland Limited – Weekly Chart

Ashok Leyland formed a bullish candlestick pattern last week near RSI support zone and propelled the stock to higher levels. One could consider going long here on a dip to Rs 86 with a stop loss below Rs 83.50 for a target of Rs 95.50.

Hero MotoCorp: Buy | Target: Rs 3,010 | Stop loss: Below Rs 2,580

Hero Moto weekly chart

After displaying positive divergence on the weekly RSI, Hero MotoCorp formed a big white candle pattern with RSI taking support at 40. This could be good trade to go long on a dip to Rs 2,650 with a stop loss below Rs 2,580 for a target of Rs 3,010."

Highlights:

- Sequential top line growth suggests improving market share

- Operating margin contraction due to end market headwinds

- Lower raw material prices to provide respite- Strong balance sheet and dominant market presence remain key positives

Bhansali Engineering Polymer (BEPL) registered a weak set of numbers for the March quarter, chiefly on the margin front. High-cost inventory and the end market slowdown seem to have squeezed the operating margin.

Chart: Q4 financials

Source: Moneycontrol Research

Key positive

BEPL posted sequential improvement in sales in Q4FY19, which is remarkable, considering the softness in the end market. It is noteworthy that the automobile industry constitutes nearly 50 percent of the end user industry.

Big negatives

The company witnessed a sharp erosion in gross margin. In January-March, it posted a gross margin of 9.9 percent, against 14.8 percent in the preceding quarter and 28.9 percent a year ago. The higher cost of goods sold appears to be a combination of pricey inventory and limited scope to pass on the cost to end clients.

Consequently, EBITDA margin dropped to 2 percent and a sharp decline in employee cost by 36 percent QoQ helped it stay afloat.

Profit before tax was down 30 percent sequentially as lower operating profit was partially offset by higher other income and lower interest expense.

Key observations

Key raw materials – butadiene and acrylonitrile – have traded lower in recent times. Butadiene prices, in particular, seem to have been impacted by weaker domestic demand in China, leading to a higher supply in exports markets like India. Fushun Petrochemical (PetroChina division) particularly has reported higher export volumes in recent times.

Styrene prices have been volatile. Management commentary from Apcotex highlighted the lower raw material price trend, which has posed a challenge in terms of managing the raw material inventory.

It’s noteworthy that while butadiene can be sourced from the domestic market, acrylonitrile and styrene are imported. In fact, the company imports 85 percent of its raw materials (styrene and acrylonitrile), which makes it vulnerable to global oil derivative price levels and currency movements.

Acrylonitrile is sourced from distant markets like the US and hence, higher lead time requires longer inventory days.

On account of the above factor and the challenges in the end market, the company’s inventory and trade receivables have jumped YoY -- though not alarming as a percentage of sales. Inventories to sales stood at 8 percent (against 6.5 percent in FY18) and trade receivables to sales at 18.2 percent compared to 15 percent earlier.

Outlook

BEPL’s positioning for the long term remains on a solid footing. What remains supportive is its strong balance sheet. It’s a zero debt company despite periodic capacity expansions.

Notably, it added 20,000 tonnes of capacity in FY18, taking the overall figure to 100,000 tonnes. According to a report, the company intends to ramp up its capacity to 137,000 tonnes, from 1,00,000 tonnes. Once completed, the capacity would meet almost 50 percent of its domestic demand.

What’s more, BEPL is looking at a mega capacity expansion plan of 200,000 tonnes in 2020-21, which is expected to bridge the domestic demand-supply gap.

However, the current trends are not encouraging. While the raw material price trajectory suggests a limited concern for the company, end market slowdown is the key headwind.

As the domestic auto industry major Maruti has guided to a mid-single digit volume growth, this remains a key business challenge. As of now, BEPL seems to be going in for a strategy of defending or increasing market share at the cost of margin.

Going forward, we expect margins to improve gradually, but EBITDA margin is unlikely to hit a mid-teen level in a hurry.

The stock is trading at 12x FY20e (estimated) earnings estimates. While valuations have turned reasonable, we suggest investors keep a wait and watch approach and accumulate at lower levels.

In the longer term, we remain positive on the company’s dominant position in the duopoly market of ABS, end client stickiness and growing expertise in speciality grades.

Highlights:

- A disappointing set of numbers for March by auto majors in all segments

- New axle load norms, tight liquidity and non-availability of finance weigh on CVs

- Postponement of the festive season to April and lower-than-expected Rabi sowing dampened tractors sales

- Two-wheeler segment is the worst hit with inventory reaching alarming levels --------------------------------------------------

Indian automobile sector continues to be in a slow lane as is evident from March 2019 volume numbers. The slowdown is due to multiple challenges such as an increase in the total cost of ownership due to mandatory long-term insurance and implementation of safety regulations, higher cost of retail finance and moderate economic activities ahead of elections.

Commercial vehicle (CV) segment sales were flat for the players in the space. The segment continues to face challenges, primarily, due to the liquidity crunch, non-availability of retail finance, lagged impact of new axle load norms and a slowdown in economic activities ahead of elections. Tractor segment also continued to remain weak on the back of the higher base of last year and subdued farm sentiments.

Three-wheeler (3W) sales were mixed on the back of very high base for last year. Two-wheeler volumes were subdued due to weak consumer sentiments led by higher cost of ownership, the high base of last year and adverse macro factors.

Commercial Vehicle – continues to be under pressureMacro challenges led by liquidity problem, financing issues, rising interest rates, lagged impact of new axle load norms and a slowdown in economic activity ahead of elections dampened customer demand for CVs. The long-term outlook, however, continues to be positive, primarily, due to the government’s focus on construction and infrastructure and increase in mining activities.

Company wise, Tata Motors registered a 1 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in CV volume led by 1.9 percent growth in the M&HCV segment and 0.3 percent in the LCV segment. Eicher Volvo witnessed a decline of 7.8 percent. Ashok Leyland and M&M posted a decline of 4 percent each in their monthly volume, primarily, due to a significant decline in M&HCV segment volume.

Cars Segment – no signs of recoveryCar segment continued to show weakness for the ninth consecutive month with no signs of recovery. Inventories were at alarming levels. Negative sentiments in the space were due to an increase in total cost ownership led by rising interest rate and mandatory long-term insurance that dampened consumer sentiments. Hence, companies in the space have posted a decline in PV volume for the month of March 2019. New product launches though helped companies.

The leader, Maruti, posted a decline of 4 percent in its volume for the month. Tata Motors’ passenger car segment witnessed a decline of 12 percent (YoY). The management of Tata Motors expects good months ahead as its new SUV, Tata Harrier has been receiving good traction. M&M, on the other hand, posted a growth of 4 percent in its monthly volume, driven by its newly-launched XUV300 model.

Two-wheeler (2W) segment: Inventory at alarming levelsThe two-wheelers space has been the worst hit with inventory days touching 100 versus normal inventory of 20 days. Hero, the leader in the space, witnessed a significant decline of 20.4 percent, Eicher, the leader in premium bike segment, also witnessed a decline of 20 percent in its monthly sales numbers and TVS posted a decline of 2 percent. Bajaj Auto, on the other hand, witnessed 38.5 percent growth in its volume on the back of aggressive pricing actions by the company on its entry-level segment which helped it captured Hero’s market share.

Eicher Motors has announced the appointment of Vinod K Dasari, ex-CEO and MD of Ashok Leyland, as the CEO of Royal Enfield. Eicher Motors will get a new perspective from its new CEO.

Three-wheeler (3W): mixed showThe overall 3W market posted mixed numbers in March 2019. TVS posted a very strong growth of 32.6 percent and M&M posted a growth of 5.2 percent. Bajaj Auto, the leader in the space, posted a decline of 12.6 percent, primarily, due to a high base of last year.

Tractors: losing momentumTractor segment has also come under pressure due to the postponement of the festive season to April and lower Rabi sowing than expected. Escorts posted a decline of 1.1 percent and M&M posting a significant decline of 30.1 percent. M&M management expects positive sentiments on the back of government's focus on rural development, a good forecast for horticulture production and an increase in the MSP that will positively impact demand for tractors in future.

Exports: mixed sentimentsBarring Maruti and Tata Motors, auto majors have posted strong growth in the export markets in the month of March 2019. Tata Motors’ management indicated the decline was due to new regulations and political uncertainty in Sri Lanka and the slump in the Middle East affecting the overall industry volumes in these markets.

Indo-Japanese Maruti Suzuki has been selling their MPV Ertiga for quite a while in India now. While there are no significant updates for the car in India, Suzuki has showcased the Ertiga Sport in Indonesia.

Although there are no mechanical changes to the car, it gets many aesthetic updates to give it a sportier look, in compliance with the nametag. It receives a sporty mesh grille, an updated front bumper in which is a new fog lamp and it also gets a front splitter. The rear also gets a new bumper with a faux diffuser and a roof spoiler. Among other differences from the standard Ertiga, the Ertiga Sport has side skirts and all-new alloys.

The cabin design remains mostly intact, though it is completely blacked out, while the steering wheel has been replaced with a flat-bottomed unit borrowed from the Swift. Though the company has not announced any plans of launching the Ertiga Sport in India, it can be expected to hit the Indian streets in the coming months.

The current-gen Ertiga is powered by the newly-developed K15B 1.5-litre VVT four-cylinder petrol engine which makes 104BHP of maximum power and 138Nm of peak torque. It also gets an option of a 1.3-litre diesel engine which makes 89BHP and 200Nm of torque.

Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL), leader in the Indian passenger vehicle market, posted a weak set of Q3 FY19 earnings. MSIL posted a 0.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in volume, due to subdued demand on lower festive sales, mandatory long-term insurance, rising interest rates and non-availability of retail financing.

Average selling price, however, saw a 2.6 percent improvement on the back of rich product mix, despite discounts offered on weak sales and higher level of inventory. This led to a two percent YoY growth in its net revenue from operations.

The auto major posted a 36.4 percent decline in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) on the back of a decline in volumes and significant rise in raw material and other expenses. These factors also led to EBITDA margin contraction of 593.5 bps (100 basis points = 1 percentage point).

The subdued near-term outlook limits stock upside, although we have a positive long-term view on the stock.

Despite Urjit Patel’s exit and setback for BJP in election results of three Hindi heartland states, Nifty5o closed in the green at 10,549.15 on Tuesday. But, the index has wiped out almost all the gains it made through the year. On December 29, 2017, the index had closed at 10,530.

During the same period, many NSE stocks fell 20-60% from their 52-week highs. As many as 22 Nifty stocks are a part of that list, which includes Tata Motors, Yes Bank, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Vedanta, Sun Pharma, IOC, Tata Steel and JSW Steel.

The loss of power in three states — Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chattisgarh — by BJP is a major event for investors to take note. Most experts feel that the journey from here on could turn volatile and the upside is likely to remain capped at 11,000 for Nifty.

Apart from political setback which could impact markets in the short term, the bigger worry will come from the global factors. In the US markets, more than half of S&P components are in a bear phase and most global investment banking firms are penciling a slower growth which could trigger a risk-off sentiment.

Foreign investors turned net sellers in December after pumping more than Rs 10,000 crore in Indian markets in November. A slow global growth environment will hurt growth for India Inc. as well which might not auger well for D-Street.

“Given, the present scenario where global economic growth is tapering, concerns on geo-political issues are on the rise, uncertain US trade policies, currency and crude oil volatility, inclusive corporate earnings growth trajectory yet to pick up; we expect 2019 to be no different from 2018, where markets may gyrate to extreme ends,” Dharmesh Kant, Head – Retail Research, IndiaNivesh Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Empirical evidence advocates bottom up approach for stock picking, which is the need of the hour. Companies that are driven by solid business models, asset-light balance sheet, high return ratios, and consistent earnings are the ones that would ride the storm,” he said.

Where investors should bet their money?

Investors will be better off not to touch high beta names until some clarity emerges with respect to General Elections 2019. But, till that time capital goods, IT, banking, agro are certain sectors which could hog the limelight.

""The Corporate banking space looks interesting, going ahead. The NPA cycle seems to have peaked out, the asset resolution bodes well, capex-cycle is slowly gathering pace, and the base for next year is very favourable. Apart from this, Pharmaceuticals and certain consumer-related stocks should do well,"" Prasanna Pathak, Fund Manager-Equity at Taurus Asset Management Co. Ltd. told Moneycontrol.

Kant feels that consumption space will outperform others, specifically FMCG, white goods, electrical & electronics, agro-chemicals, and select financials.

Sahil Kapoor, Chief Market Strategist, Edelweiss Investment Research, is of the view that pharma stocks could make a comeback in 2019 as current factors have led to extensive price damage.

Strengthened by tie-ups with companies like Google, Yes Bank and Maruti Suzuki, Mexico's interactive indoor theme park Kidzania is looking at bolstering its presence in India. Co-owned by Shah Rukh Khan, it is planning to invest close to Rs 90 crore in its Bengaluru facility, scheduled to open in 2019.

While expansion to the south had been on the cards for more than two years now, lack of appropriate location with close to 1 lakh sq ft of area deferred it. KidZania, however, has finally zeroed in on a location in Bengaluru.

""We want a facility in the southern part of the country and Bengaluru has been finalised for the same. Since our concept is completely different from any activity centre for children we would want to focus on increasing the innovation and take kids out of their video gaming addiction and introduce them to more engaging real life like games,"" said Tarandeep Singh Sekhon, director, marketing, KidZania India.

Spread over 75,000 square feet in Mumbai, and 96,000 square feet in Delhi-NCR, the annual revenue of both the parks is in excess of Rs 75 crore.

""Revenue from ticket-sales at KidZania is 60 per cent whereas non-ticketing income is 40 percent and comes from brand partnerships, F&B, merchandise selling and others. Tickets at the facilities start at Rs 1,000 and go up to Rs 1,500 depending on the number of hours spent,"" added Sekhon.

KidZania is an interactive indoor theme park for children.

KidZania was founded in Mexico City in 1997.The first edutainment centre was opened in 1999 in Mexico. As of today, KidZania is present in 24 cities across 19 countries.

In India, KidZania is operational in Noida and Mumbai. The franchise license for KidZania in India is owned by Imagination Edutainment India Pvt Ltd. whose share-holders are Singapore-based KidZ Inc, Comcraft Group, Xander Group, Maxfield Management Limited. They collectively hold 74 percent. The rest of the 26 percent is held by Shah Rukh Khan in his personal capacity."

Macquarie Capital Securities expects correction in the midcap segment to continue going ahead due to expected rise in cost of capital in the times to come.

“The big macro theme for the next two years would be the rise in cost of capital rising globally. This will impact valuations across the board,” Sandeep Bhatia, Head of Equity-India at Macquarie Capital Securities told CNBC-TV18 in an interview. Midcap indices on BSE and NSE have fallen 18-20 percent on a year-to-date basis.

Having said that, he expects earnings recovery to cushion the negative impact.

The expert also presented views on specific sectors. Here is a gist of what he said.

Information Technology

Bhatia expects strong US business to have a good impact on technology companies. He expects IT earnings growth to be around 14-15 percent. Some positive surprises are anticipated as well, he added. Stocks of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and HCL Technologies are the ones he likes.

Consumption

The global research firm is betting on festive season demand to shore up the stock, going forward. ITC stock is looking good, he said, adding that the impact of hikes have played through. He expects cigarette business volume growth to be back on growth track after months of pressure.

Financials

The expert believes one could look at large and high quality names in the banking space as correction in the NBFC space is not over yet. For the latter, cost and amount of capital will be an issue that will hit the growth for the next 12 months.

Maruti Suzuki

Macquarie is bullish on the stock and believes that any correction in it is an opportunity to buy. It expects the company to be largest car manufacturer for a decade. “It is the one car firm across world which is most committed to India,” Bhatia told the channel."
"June 18, 2018 08:43 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/automobile-companies-to-see-30-spike-in-capital-expenditure-in-next-two-fiscals-2603261.html,"Automobile companies will increase their capital expenditure by at least 30 percent to Rs 58,000 crore over the next two fiscal years to meet the rising demand as well as to meet the new regulatory requirements, says a report.

According to Crisil, passenger vehicle (PV) makers will account for about 70 per cent of this Rs 58,000 crore additional capex, followed by commercial vehicle manufacturers at 20 percent and the balance by two-wheeler makers.

Anuj Sethi, senior director at Crisil, said about half of the Rs 58,000 crore will be to expand capacity to cater to growth in demand, and the balance for new products and technology to conform to tighter regulations.

The OEM space is largely duopolistic with the top two players in each segment enjoying 60-70 per cent market share.

The top two players in the PV segment, Maruti and Hyundai, are operating at close to optimal levels and are even resorting to lowering exports to meet domestic demand, while leading players in other segments are operating at utilisation levels of over 70-75 per cent.

Vehicle demand is expected to grow in most segments in high single digits till fiscal 2020, supported by rising disposable incomes and increasing industrial and rural activity, Sethi added.

New model launches and investment in product development, including electric vehicles will also be necessitated due to intense competition.

Crisil expects around eight new major model launches in fiscal 2019 in the PV segment alone, compared with six in fiscal 2018.

Companies are pumping money into technology to ensure products conform to regulatory changes, including BS-VI emission norms, braking norms and crash tests, which would also take away a good portion of this additional capex.

Despite sizeable funding requirements for capex in the next two years, the report expects credit quality auto companies to remain stable as they enjoy strong cash flows, good balance sheets as well as promoter support."

Auto majors have started coming out of regulatory headwinds that they faced over last few quarters. Most companies have reported a strong set of sales numbers for the month ending August 2017 compared to the same month last year.

The August numbers showed three interesting trends: Commercial vehicles (CV) witnessed strong growth on the back of good monsoon and increased production of BSIV compliant vehicles; early signs of revival in three-wheeler sales following government’s decision to end the permit raj and a pick-up in exports on the back of improving global climate.

We believe that GST-led disruptions are largely behind us and a normal monsoon and the festive season would continue to act as catalysts for growth for in the near future.

Commercial Vehicles (CV) – continued demand picked up

The month saw overall demand pickup in the CV segment.

M&M posted healthy growth thanks largely to a good monsoon and rural penetration of the company. Ashok Leyland surprised us with its numbers, indicating the strong acceptance of its new iEGR technology.

Tata Motors wasn't far behind as it also logged good growth figures due to growing demand across segments led by increased production of BSIV compliant vehicles. M&HCV (Medium and Heavy CVs) witnessed a strong pick-up in demand on the back of acceptance of SCR technology. Additionally, the SCV (small CV) cargo and pickup segments continued the growth momentum helped by new product launches in the XL range of Tata Ace and Tata Xenon Yodha pickup.

Eicher Volvo also witnessed a healthy growth of 9 percent (YoY) in the month.

Cars Segment – leader continued to post strong numbers

Maruti, the leader in the cars segment, continued to post a very strong set of numbers. The domestic volume growth was led by growth in both PV (passenger vehicles) and UV (utility vehicles) segments. Tata Motors also witnessed a healthy growth in UV segment due to strong demand of Tata HEXA. For M&M, however, the struggle continued with the company posting a meager growth of 6 percent (YoY) in the PV segment.

Two-wheeler (2W) segment: Hero and Eicher maintain their edge

In two-wheeler space, Hero, a formidable player in 100/110cc bikes and Eicher, a leader in 150cc plus bikes, posted strong growth in sales volume. For Eicher, bikes under 350cc witnessed a growth of 28.6 percent. However, sales of bikes above 350cc witnessed a significant fall of 30.4 percent, thereby continuing to confirm our hypothesis about the subtle change in customer’s preference towards 150cc-350cc segment. TVS also posted a healthy growth of 15.5 percent in 2W segment primarily led by the growth in scooters.

Three-wheelers (3W): nascent signs of revival

The three-wheeler space has started showing signs of improvement with all companies except M&M posting healthy growth. TVS witnessed a strong growth followed by Bajaj. The end of the “Raj Permit” in Maharashtra and 10,000 new permits in Delhi should boost overall three-wheeler volumes in the domestic market, going forward.

Tractors: Gains from a good monsoon

Both the players, Escorts and M&M, continue to post healthy growth in tractor sales, primarily driven by a normal monsoon and rural penetration of these companies. The management of M&M expects that good rains are expected to boost the rural income leading to a uptick in tractor demand in the upcoming festive season.

Exports: early signs of improvement

Auto companies had been struggling in the export markets for a while now. If August numbers are any indication, the road ahead appears to be smoother. TVS yet again witnessed a healthy growth in its exports followed by Eicher Motors. Escorts continued to maintain its growth in the exports market.

The company, which surprised us was Bajaj Auto. It posted a growth of 7.5 percent in its exports on the back of stabilizing currency and retail sales in Nigeria. The management also mentioned that geographies like Philippines, Latin America, Egypt, East Africa, and Nepal have stabilised.

Tata Motors and M&M continue to face pressure on foreign roads."

Car market leader Maruti Suzuki aims to aggressively target the domestic consumer which as per plan involves doubling of output capacity, launching a series of next-gen products including a ‘World Car’ from India.

The maker of popular cars such as Alto and Swift will nearly double its production capacity to 3 million units by 2025 from 1.56 million clocked last year to defend and grow its domestic market share.

Further, the Delhi-based company will have a ‘Global Car’ developed almost entirely in India leveraging the rapidly growing local research and development center. This car will be developed by Indian engineers from Maruti Suzuki in India, according to sources.

While Maruti Suzuki has been advancing its own capabilities since the past few years a substantial chunk of vehicle developmental work still happens in Japan. For instance, the Baleno platform-based new Dzire was majorly developed in Japan but designed to suit Indian needs.

Maruti Suzuki launches all new Dzire. Built on a fifth generation B platform the Dzire is built using high tensile steel making it light weight to deliver better environmental performance and fuel efficiency.

More than 100 vendors of Maruti Suzuki were taken to Singapore recently for the annual vendor’s meet. The car market leader shared plans for the next 7-8 years at the meeting.

While the company has been consistent in launching new products the pace of new launches will continue in the coming years. As per plans Maruti will launch at least one new model every year between 2019-21 and at least two new launches every year from 2022-23 onwards.

To bolster its production capabilities Maruti is already pushing for advancement of deadlines set for the new Gujarat plant. It has requested Suzuki Motors Corporation, which owns the plant, to advance the date of inauguration of the second line to 2018 from the earlier deadline of 2019.

Eventually, the plant will have three production lines (each having a capacity of 250,000 per year) with a cumulative capacity of 750,000 units a year. However the company hopes to stretch this to 850,000 units a year, according to Maruti Suzuki Chairman R C Bhargava.

The company is hoping to close the year with sales of at least 1.75 million units which will be a growth of 12 percent compared to its previous year’s total sales (domestic + exports) of 1.56 million units.

Maruti commanded a share of little above 47 percent last year which is a growth compared to last year when it closed at 45 percent share, as per data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers."

The monthly auto numbers captured our attention for several reasons. First, coming within a couple of months of the remonetisation exercise, it is an early pointer to the success of that effort. Second, the Supreme Court recently banned the sale of BS III Vehicles (vehicles that are not compliant to the latest emission norm BS IV) from FY18 thereby forcing companies to liquidate their inventory in March. Finally, the numbers for FY17 are a good starting point to ascertain the way forward for these automobile companies.

For passenger vehicles, at 3,043,201, the industry volume exhibited a rather impressive 9 percent growth, the highest in the past six years. The market leader Maruti’s overall domestic volume growth at 10.7 percent closely tracked the industry. However, a more segmental analysis suggests that the traditional ‘small car’ did not capture the buyers’ fancy any more – the segment in fact shrank in recent months. The ‘crown jewel’ for the company has been the ‘Compact SUV’ segment featuring Ertiga, S Cross and Brezza that grew by 107 percent.

M&M’s inability to provide the market with the right product is reflected in its sluggish numbers. For Tata Motors, the revamped product pipeline with a value-for-money proposition like Tiago, did wonders for the volumes, as expected. With a robust launch pipeline in the coming year, Tata Motors will be an interesting company to watch out for, although the stellar performance of the car division is too small to move the needle (EBIDTA contribution less than 1 percent). The company will continue to be driven by fortunes of Jaguar Land Rover, and so is a bit more volatile than its Indian peers.

For Mahindra, while the share of rural at 56 percent remains a near-term concern (given the forecast of sub-par rains), the company’s leadership position in agri equipment, ability to leverage Ssangyong’s expertise in launching new products and an extremely reasonable valuation makes it an interesting long-term idea. Maruti, with over 20 percent CAGR in earnings growth in the coming two years (driven by exciting product launches and capacity expansion), will continue to to be a candidate to be accumulated on any correction.

In sum: With the high performers in the automobile sector (that are relatively unscathed due to demonetisation or BS III ban) priced to perfection, investors should look for long-term opportunity at a deep discount. For long-term investors, M&M’s current valuation lends comfort. Maruti, whose superior growth outlook is priced to perfection may provide entry opportunity only on a correction. Hero Motocorp may provide a window on tactical gain on disappointing numbers. For Ashok Leyland, the financial hit on account of BS IV judgement can present investors with a deep discount opportunity. The robust volume performance of the two-listed agri machinery (tractor) player should silence critics of demonetisation. However, the valuation of Escorts appears to have already rewarded the superior performance.

For the two-wheeler players, volume clearly is on the slow lane. Bajaj Auto at 20.1X and Eicher Motors at 46X trailing earnings will therefore do not appear to be exciting ideas.

Interestingly, out of the reported inventory of close to 824,275 vehicles that are reportedly impacted by the ban on sale of BS III vehicles, a majority belongs to the two-wheeler segment. Of the 671,308 two-wheelers impacted by this ban, around 250,000-300,000 belongs to Hero Motocorp. Looking at the monthly numbers, it is difficult to make a conclusion on the extent of inventory liquidation; however, it is unlikely that the sector has exhausted its inventory.

However, not all is lost for the two-wheeler companies. Two-wheeler manufacturers may need to install catalytic converter in BS-III vehicles to make it BS-IV compliant at the cost of Rs 500/vehicle plus also bear the freight cost of Rs 1,300/vehicle. The total cost of conversion of BS III vehicle to BS IV, may still be less than Rs 5000. Hence, the total loss for the two-wheeler sector will be a moderate Rs 270 crore. If we assume Hero Motocorp does retrofitting of around 2 lakh vehicles it would incur an incremental cost of around Rs 90 crore. Considering a worst case scenario of the company’s inability to sell 2 lakh odd vehicles – it impacts revenue to the tune of Rs 866 cr or 3 percent of Hero’s annual sales. So any significant correction due to excessive discount or one-time provision can provide tactical entry opportunity.

Turning to the commercial vehicle manufacturers, the sequential improvement in volumes for Volvo Eicher and SML Isuzu does give us confidence that the BS III inventory concerns may be largely behind us.

However, for Tata Motors even if there is unsold BS III inventory, the quantum won’t be significant and it can tap export markets without taking much of a hit on financials. Ashok Leyland, according to press reports, has unsold inventory of close to 17,500 vehicles. Looking at the monthly number, it doesn’t appear that the company had much success in selling a large part of it.

For commercial vehicles, the BS-IV engine is different from the BS-III engine. Hence the engine of BS-III vehicles will need to be replaced. Commercial vehicle (CV) manufacturers can sell BS-III vehicles in export markets as SAARC countries and African countries are still BS-III. But the export market isn’t large enough to absorb the reported inventory.

In case Ashok Leyland cannot find markets for nearly 15,000 vehicles, the revenue hit will be close to Rs 2,025 crore – close to 10 percent of its annual revenue. Should Ashok Leyland report a one-time hit on account of such a loss, it might give long-term investors an opportunity to gradually build positions, considering that the company has already started producing BSIV vehicles."

Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest car maker, on Saturday reported a rise of 8.1 percent in total volumes at 139,763 units in March as against 129,345 units clocked in the same month last year, as per disclosure made by the company.

Domestic sales grew to 127,999 units during the month, posting an increase of 7.7 percent as compared to 118,895 units sold in the corresponding month last year. Growth in exports were a step better increasing by 12.6 percent to 11,764 units during the reporting month.

“Demand for our products remained strong throughout the year, enabling us to close 2016-17 with 10.7 percent domestic growth and achieve faster than industry growth for the fifth year in a row,” said RS Kalsi, Executive Director (Marketing and Sales) at Maruti Suzuki India Limited. “Alto, Dzire, Wagon R and Swift continue to remain the top sellers in the Indian market. NEXA has brought in new customers by redefining the car purchase and ownership experience.”

While the Mini Compact segment where it sells the Alto and Wagon R posted a decline of 15.6 percent the Compact segment comprising Swift, Ignis, Ritz, Celerio, Baleno and Dzire grew by 29.7 percent thanks to the continued robust demand for the new launches Ignis and Baleno.

Utility vehicle segment comprising Vitara Brezza, S-Cross and Ertiga, posted a growth of 31.8 percent during the month whereas the vans like Eeco and Omni posted a decline in sales by 9.8 percent.

Kalsi said they continue to get healthy orders for Brezza, Baleno and Ignis are trying to increase availability so as to minimise wait time for customers.

With this the Delhi-based company ended the financial year with its highest ever total sales of 1,568,603 units, a growth of 9.8 percent as compared to 1,429,248 units."

India's appetite for flashy sports utility vehicles (SUV) irrespective of their size has become insatiable. One only needs to look at the sales charts of auto manufacturers to know that this is true. That is why vehicle manufacturers have lined up more than a dozen new SUV launches in 2017-18 targetting the budget-to-luxury buyer.

Ranging from Rs 5.5 lakh to Rs 60 lakh these SUVs from Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra at the lower end of the spectrum to Volvo and Land Rover at the premium end will light up the coming financial year. Launch of at least one new SUV from Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi will also be seen during the year.

Rush for new launches comes on the back of a robust growth in demand for new SUVs. According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturer sales of utility vehicles during April-January grew by a robust 32 percent even as the rest of the passenger vehicle segment grew by only 9 percent during the same year.

The steady rise in SUVs in the last 2-3 years has translated into the utility vehicle (UV) segment now commanding a share of 25 percent by end of January as compared to 20 percent in the same period last year. UVs made up just 14 percent of the PV industry five years ago.

The compact SUV segment, which saw high voltage action with the entry of Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai, will now witness the debut of Tata Motors, India’s fourth largest car maker, with the most-awaited product Nexon. The five-seater, sub-4 meter curvy SUV is expected to be launched close to Diwali this year, as per sources.

Not far behind will be Ford Motor Company which will introduce the revamped EcoSport, the product that brought the US company back in the reckoning. Showcased at the LA Auto Show last year the new model boasts of a redone front grille, a wider set of headlights and a sporty rear bumper.

The second half of the financial year will see Mahindra & Mahindra debut a stylish new SUV codenamed S201. This new SUV will be based on the X100 platform which presently houses the SsangYong Tivoli. This new compact vehicle will be positioned between M&M's existing offerings KUV100 and TUV300 and will take on the likes of Ford Ecosport, Maruti Brezza and Tata Nexon.

Jeep, the original UV manufacturer from the US now owned by Italian auto maker Fiat, will introduce the Compass, its most affordable product expected to be priced under Rs 30 lakh. This will be the third mainstream model after the launch of Wrangler and Cherokee in August last year.

Upbeat on demand Swedish car brand Volvo, now owned by a Chinese company, will launch two new SUVs starting with the V90 Cross Country next month followed by the XC60 later in the year. There is also the probability of the company bringing the new XC40 which could perhaps come in the final quarter of 2017-18.

There will be renewed interest by carmakers in the Rs 20-30 lakh price bracket after a lull when some manufacturers had withdrawn their products from this segment following lacklustre demand. Toyota’s Fortuner is the market leader in this segment trailed by the Hyundai Sante Fe, SsangYong Rexton, Ford Endeavour, Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara.

Honda with the CR-V, Nissan with its X-Trail and Volkswagen with the Tiguan will light up this segment in the next few months. The X-Trail will be the stand-out model in the segment as the company is launching the hybrid version of the popular SUV, a first in this segment. The Japanese company claims an increase of nearly 30 percent in the X-Trail’s fuel-efficiency."

The company has sold a total of 1,24,114 units in the April-January period this fiscal, a decline of 23.2 per cent.

""Last year we were in a run out period of previous models and now we have launched the new City and the WR-V will be launched in this fiscal but the real sales will happen in the next fiscal year,"" Honda Cars India President and CEO Yoichiro Ueno told PTI.

Honda plans to launch the WR-V on March 16, while the new City sedan was introduced last month.

""Hopefully, these two models will add to total sales volume of the company in the next fiscal,"" he said.

Sharing the strategy for the W-RV, he said Honda is looking to position the model a bit differently from compact SUVs such as Maruti's Vitara Brezza or Ford EcoSport.

""Our direction is, to kind of, creating a new segment with this model,"" Ueno said.

The sub-4 metre SUV segment is rapidly growing in the Indian market selling around 2 lakh units annually.

On sales expectations from WR-V he said: ""We are expecting some good sales but not huge may be because we are newcomers. Market is growing, however, models are also increasing."" Ueno said although some customers could compare between WR-V and the Jazz, HCIL is not expecting ""cannibalisation"" between the two.

""It's the synergy of these models that we think can capture a broader range of customers,"" he added.

The new City has also gained traction in the market and sold 6,318 units last month and received over 10,000 bookings since its launch on February 14.

When asked about the company's plans for a third plant in Gujarat, Ueno said the investment has been done keeping in mind future growth potential of Indian market.

""The decision of Gujarat plant was taken couple of years back. At that time our volume was smaller, however, we expect Indian market to grow. In the near future, it may be one of the top three biggest markets (in the world),"" Ueno said.

He, however, said the company currently has no plans to expand capacities in India and the purchase of land in Gujarat was to prepare for the future.

""It is kind of pre-investment for the future expansion,"" Ueno said.

Currently, HCIL sells around two lakh units annually, while its production capacity stands at around 2.4 lakh units from its two plants in Greater Noida and Tapukara (Rajasthan).

""The Tapukara plant can be further expanded. I think for several years, we can manage our sales from two factories. If sales grow this land (in Gujarat) can be one option to expand.

We haven't yet finished purchasing the land,"" Ueno said."

He also worked with Honda outfits in New Zealand, Thailand, China and North America.But don’t be led to believe that Honda is setting the sale charts on fire in India. It is rather far from it.Last month concluded for Honda with a record decline of 15 consecutive months of fall in sales. As per SIAM data Honda reported a fall of 23 per cent in volumes in April-January even when the industry reported a growth of 9 percent during the same period.Its average monthly sales of 12,400 units this financial year has been only slightly better than its average monthly the year before at 11,200 units.“Spending a year in India is the same as spending three years elsewhere”, said the Kendo (Japanese swordfighting martial art) fighter in an free-wheeling interaction with Moneycontrol.“I learnt Kendo in Japan when I was 10, but a hard hit on my head during one of the bouts made me quit”, admitted Ueno immediately.Ueno is getting ready for his second bout and this time he is sure not the one to quit first. Under fire from competition Honda is going back to its strength of premium positioning which is also where unlikely players – Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai – have made threatening inroads in the last two years.Honda is looking to cement its premium position with the City, Civic (to-be-launched) and Accord while simultaneously reducing focus on mass market models like Brio, Mobilio and BR-V. With 7,500 bookings in two weeks the new City has brought consumers back to Honda showrooms.“I would not say it was a mistake entering the hatchback segment with the Brio however there was gap between the customer expectation of the Honda brand and what we thought the customers would like to have. May be in future the focus will be on the higher segment”, added Ueno.What has surprised Ueno and his sales team is the response to the top-end variant of the City (christened ZX) which cost more than Rs 15 lakh on-road Mumbai. From the western region alone 41 per cent of City buyers have opted the ZX variant even though its price tag puts it in the league of luxury saloons.The company further reports that quota of Accord Hybrids allotted for India became a sell-out not just in February but for March as well. The robust response is despite the steep price tag of the flagship sedan which is nearly Rs 50 lakh.“There is a family from Punjab who bought four Accord Hybrids. We are struggling to get more lots allotted to India”, said Raman Kumar Sharma, vice president, Honda Cars India.Next month (March 16) the company is lining up the launch of WRV, a urban-style crossover vehicle based on the Jazz platform. To be positioned in the premium segment of Rs 6.5 lakh and above, the WRV will be marketed as mini sports utility vehicle (SUV) to cash in on the growing popularity of such class of vehicles.The company is also studying the possibility of launching its luxury brand Acura in India. Honda will have to reengineer the Acura products and make them right hand drive to be able to sell in India. Acuras have sedans, SUVs and sports cars and are sold in US, Canada, China and Japan."

Bulls cheered up on government's decision of no long-term capital gains tax on equities and no tinkering of short-term capital gains tax. It was biggest Budget day gains for Nifty in 12 years. The 50-share index ended up 155.10 points or 1.8 percent at 8716.40 while the Sensex closed up 485.68 points or 1.8 percent at 28141.64.

Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO - HDFC securities feels the market is rejoicing that they can continue to enjoy the fruits of investment.

Stating that the growth oriented Budget will make the FIIs return to India, he also feels that there were few disappointments for the market. “There has been no mention about creation of a Bad bank or Public Sector Asset Rehabilitation Agency which can speed up solutions for rising challenges of NPA for Banks and loss making PSUs. Though a lot of funds have been allocated for public capex, very few initiatives are visible for kick starting private capex,” he adds.

Abolition of FIPB also boosted the market. Analysts feel the move indicates ease of doing business.

Ajay Bodke (CEO & Chief Portfolio Manager: PMS), Prabhudas Lilladher feels the medium term trajectory of the market would depend on the revival of earnings cycle that continues to remain tepid over the last few years, impact of remonetization and GST on India’s economic growth as well as challenging global headwinds in view of fierce protectionism, barriers to free trade, rising interest rates in the US and hardening of global commodity prices especially crude.

On the macro front, the government pegged fiscal deficit at 3.2 percent of the GDP in the fiscal 2017-18. Revenue deficit will be reduced to 2.1 percent for 2017-18 from 2.3 percent in the ongoing fiscal. Net market borrowing would be Rs 3.48 lakh crore in 2017-18 from 4.1 percent in the current fiscal. In stock specific action, auto, infrastructure and bank stocks made super rally on government's slew of measures. FMCG index also climbed 3 percent led by ITC. ITC gained over 4 percent as excise duty hike was within the analysts' expectations limit. Jaitley hiked excise duty by 2.5-6 percent on various lengths of cigarettes, which was below the market expectations of 8-10 percent. The government also increased additional duty on unmanufactured tobacco to 8.3 percent from 4.2 percent.Maruti, M&M, ICICI Bank and SBI Bank were other gainers in the Sensex.

Demonetisation notwithstanding car market leader Maruti Suzuki started the year on a robust note with sales growing 27.1 percent in January to 144,396 units as against 113,606 units clocked in the same month last year.

Domestic sales marked a growth of 25.9 percent to 133,934 units led by Baleno and Brezza which continued to attract buyers even months after their launch. Sales in the corresponding month last year stood 106,383 units.

January is traditionally considered to be a good month for automotive sales as consumers who hold back purchases in December generally prefer to buy a vehicle in the new year.

Sales of utility vehicles including Ertiga and Brezza doubled to 16,313 units during the month. Sales of its only executive sedan Ciaz grew by 20 percent to 6,530 units.

With the exception of the super compact segment where Maruti sells the Dzire Tour sedan, which fell by 15 percent, all other segments have marked growth. Segment with aging models like Alto and WagonR too marked a growth of 11 percent during the month.

Automotive companies are likely to report a sharp hit on their third quarter earnings on account of demonetisation, which has crippled wholesale and retail off-takes over the past two months.

New vehicle purchases nosedived in November and December after the government junked popular bank notes, while bookings and enquiries are understood to have fallen by half during the same period.

Automotive sales hit a 16-year low last month with steep drops witnessed in two-wheelers and passenger cars. Automakers sold 19 percent fewer vehicles compared to the same month last year. The drop was 5.5 percent in November, according to data shared by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. October remained a bright spot registering a growth of 8 percent during the festive period of Diwali.

“In Q3 of FY17, automobile industry witnessed slump in volumes on account of government’s demonetisation initiative,” said Karvy Stock Broking in its report. “Both November and December 2016 witnessed YoY decline across majority of the segments. Apart from cash crunch, negative sentiment and uncertainty on government’s policy also restricted consumption by buyers, despite better monsoon.”

Passenger vehicle sales grew mildly by 1.8 percent during the quarter to 749,480 units as against 736,253 units sold in the same quarter a year ago. The growth is largely due to robust sales clocked during October which accounted for 37 percent of total sales during the quarter.

Sales of two-wheelers were the worst hit, registering a fall of nearly 5 percent during the quarter to 3.95 million as against 4.14 million sold in the same quarter last year. In December alone, sales plummeted by 22 percent, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. More than half of two-wheeler volumes depend on the rural areas. Post demonetisation, the rural belt has been adversely affected, resulting in fall in retail demand.

Volumes of commercial vehicles, too, came under pressure during the quarter, posting a fall of 1.1 percent to 165,308 units as compared to 167,202 units sold during the same quarter last year.

To make matters worse, most commodity prices have gone up. “Commodity prices have moved up sequentially, with an increase of 10 percent (34 percent YoY) in global steel and 1 percent (6 percent YoY) in aluminum prices,” stated a report from Quant Capital. “In comparison, domestic rubber prices declined by 18 percent (4 percent y-o-y).”

In addition, companies were compelled to offer steep discounts to entice customers at a time when dealers were eager to push out their 2016 stock, given the reluctance to buy vehicles built during the previous year. Some older generation models were being sold at a discount of Rs 1 lakh or 15 percent lower than their value.

“Due to higher inventory push and liquidity issue, discount levels were high to push sales during the second half of Q3FY17,” stated the Karvy report. “Therefore, profitability of auto companies would witness dual impact of low volume and higher discounts. We expect YoY as well as QoQ decline in operating margins for our coverage universe.”"

Benchmark indices continued to be volatile with the Nifty hovering around 8250 level ahead of quarterly earnings season that will begin with Infosys, TCS and IndusInd Bank this week. Overall analysts will closely watch the impact of demonetisation on earnings and companies' outlook for March quarter.

Sanjay Mookim of Bank of America Merrill Lynch says while the consensus Sensex earnings growth expectation for FY17 has come down to 8 percent from 20 percent at the beginning of the fiscal, FY18 earnings growth expectations at 18 percent is still high.

Factoring the impact of demonetisation, on a top down basis, he expects Sensex FY18-19 EPS growth to be 12-14 percent.

This relatively robust earnings growth could drive Sensex to 29,000 by December 2017, Mookim feels.

The US Fed was expected to stay pat and that is what it did, he said. “There is incrementally no news.” He said he found two problems with Bank of Japan’s policy decision. BoJ has committed to overshooting the inflation target. He doesn’t think this is credible. It has instituted a bond yield target at about 0 percent. “Again, I find it to be not useful,” he said, adding that that BoJ is targeting the bond yield at a level higher than current market level. By signalling this, the BoJ is saying too low bond yields can be counterproductive. But according to common wisdom lower rates are good for the economy, he said.2:30 pm Upcoming IPO: L&T Technology Services, the subsidiary of engineering & construction giant Larsen and Toubro , will list its equity shares on September 23.

The markets, he said, are running on two engines: financials and consumers. Anything related to these two sectors are doing well, he said. But if one were to look outside these two, the market is beginning to struggle for ideas, he maintained. One fallout of this trend is that these two sectors will get expensive with every passing week. “Retail traders should dismiss notions of expensive [market] for now and stay with these two pockets.”

9:30 am Rate cute in Sept? The US jobs data was weaker than expected at 151,000. This has pushed back the expectation of Fed rate hike and so world shares rose on Monday but did not spark a huge rally. Ian Hui, JP Morgan AMC said the market is still pricing in a 30 percent possibility of a hike in September. So, the house does not entirely rule out a September rate hike by Fed. However, chances of December rate hike have enhanced because the Fed will have to maintain its credibility.

Although emerging markets (EMs) could continue to see a relief rally on back of a Fed rate hike being pushed forward and weakness in the dollar, the US people could be disappointed that their economy has not shown growth in jobs. Therefore, the cues are mixed and it may not be a straight positive for EMs, although near-term fears of dollar strengthening and hike expectations have eased off, said Hui.Don't miss: Investment tips: Here are 7 stocks for bulls & bears in market

Shares of telecom majors Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular took a beating in an otherwise lacklustre market after Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani signalled a price war in the telecom sector with free voice calls, cheap data and a free fouth-month trial for its telecom offering Jio.Bulls showed signs of fatigue after four straight days of gains, and benchmark indices remained in a narrow range right from the start of trade.

Index heavyweight Reliance Industries rose around 1 percent as the company's Chairman Mukesh Ambani spoke about Jio's plans at the annual general meeting. However, the stock failed to sustain gains.Market expert, Ambareesh Baliga is worried that Reliance Jio offerings will not only hurt the incumbents, but would not help Reliance Industries either for next 3-4 quarters.The sector will surely see a lot of consolidation and merger and acquisitions and only a maximum of four players may remain. Moreover, only post 12-18 months, the sector will get re-rated. Vodafone will also have to look at pushing its IPO further, says Baliga. “At present, Reliance is basically looking at maximizing its subscriber base and not ARPUs (average revenue per users) as such,” he adds.

However, auto and bank stocks were supporting the market. BSE Auto and Bankex were up 1 percent from previous close. Auto sales in August so far has been firm. Maruti Suzuki , the country's largest passenger vehicles manufacturer, has registered a 12.2 percent growth in August sales, driven largely by Vitara Brezza, Ciaz and some compact cars. It sold 1.32 lakh units during the month against 1.17 lakh units sold in same period last year.

Denso India, a subsidiary of the leading Japanese auto components maker Denso Corporation, is eyeing Rs 5,000 crore revenue by FY18.

""We are targeting sales revenue of Rs 5,000 crore by 2017-18. Last year, our sales stood at Rs 3,500 crore. But let me add this was revenue we had clocked way back in 2010 fiscal when the domestic auto industry was on a song,"" Denso India deputy Managing Director Tako Nojiri told PTI.

The company, which is the single largest supplier of components to domestic carmakers like Maruti, Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, and Tata among others, is expecting an annual revenue growth of nine per cent till 2020, he said.

The Japanese major entered India 32 years ago and now has nine manufacturing units and seven companies, employing over 4,000 people. It claims over 60 per cent market share car components in the country and also serves heavy vehicle-makers as well as the Railways.

When asked about capex plans to meet this higher growth target, Nojiri said nothing is in the pipeline now as the company has already installed capacity till 2020.

On the government plans to skip BS V and directly jump to BS VI emission norms, he said Denso is already Euro VI compliant and therefore no issues to meet the new deadline.

Japan-based Denso Corporation is an over USD 4.2 billion company and is a world leader in auto components.

Denso began operations in 1984 with a plant in Noida that produces starters, alternators, air conditioning systems, radiators, windshield wiper motors, ECUs, fuel pumps and fuel injectors for four-wheelers. It also supplies magnetos and CDIs to two-wheeler makers which are sold through over 190 service networks.

It has technical alliance with Subros and Lucas-TVS since the 1980s and in 2011 it established joint venture with Subros to design automotive ACs. Its technical center at Manesar (Haryana), set up in 2012, develops power trains, electric and electronic systems, information and safety systems, and small motors.

It acquired majority ownership of instrument cluster subsidiary of Pricol in April 2013 to increase its instrument cluster business and launched next-phase engine management system consisting of engine ECUs, fuel pumps and injectors that can comply with Bharat stage V norms in 2013.

Denso also has a JV with Kirloskar Group under the name Denso Kirloskar Industries."

""Earnings could grow 12-14 percent in FY17 and we won't be surprised to see rise by a similar amount,"" he said.

After a tumultuous ride, the market ended lower on Union Budget day. See-sawing around 849 points, the Sensex swings were quite heady for investors throughout the day. As Finance Minister Arun Jaitley read out his Budget proposals for FY17, investors’ knee jerk reaction eroded almost 660 points from the benchmark indices. However, that did not last long and the biggest culprits ITC and SBI erased losses to pick pace in the market. A lower-than-expected recapitalisation of Rs 25000 crore hurt PSU banks especially SBI while ITC was reacting to excise duty of 15 percent on tobacco products. Both the stocks recovered and ended with 1-2 percent gains.

At remaining hours of trade, ONGC, Infosys and Maruti dragged market. ONGC slumped 10 percent, Infosys fell over 3 percent while the auto car maker lost 5 percent at closing.

The Sensex ended down 152.30 points or 0.7 percent at 23002, and the Nifty slipped 42.70 points or 0.6 percent at 6987.05.

Samir Arora, Founder & Fund Manager at Helios Capital says the biggest disappointment is the recapitalisation of Rs 25,000 crore for public sector banks. Arora says that it is like “trying to say (we) don’t believe in the issue.”

What also hurt market sentiment today was increase in securities transaction tax (STT). Rate of STT in options is proposed to be increased from 0.017 percent to 0.05 percent.

Ramesh Damani, Member, BSE that the Finance Minister has chosen wisely by imposing STT and dividend distribution tax instead of tinkering with long-term capital gains tax and has also kept sales tax stable.

Post Budget, Citi maintains a positive view on India, with a 27200 December 2016 Sensex target. However, it says Budget is unlikely to fire the market or the mood. It says rating agencies and RBI should like the decisive call on fiscal consolidation.

Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's retained its sovereign rating on India despite the government sticking to its fiscal deficit target in Budget as it waited for further improvement in public finances. S&P said it would wait for the government to improve its net debt and fiscal consolidation and does not expect to change India's BBB- rating with a 'stable' outlook until next year.

Jaitley said that the government will be able to meet its FY16 fiscal deficit target at 3.9 percent of GDP and reiterated its commitment to containing fiscal deficit at 3.5 percent of GDP in FY17.

Buzzing stocks

Auto, capital goods and IT stocks were under selling pressure throughout the day. Auto stocks reacted negatively to FM’s proposal for a 1-4 percent infrastructure cess on cars across categories. There will be a cess of 1 percent on small petrol and CNG cars, 2.5 percent on diesel cars of certain capacity and 4 percent on other higher engine capacity vehicles and SUVs. Also, tax will be collected at source of 1 percent on purchase of luxury cars exceeding value of Rs 10 lakh.IDBI Bank jumped 5 percent, as the government will also consider option of reducing its stake to below 50 percent.

Oil marketing companies rallied while ONGC fell 10 percent as the FM did not make any proposal for a re-imposition of 5 percent customs duty on crude.

Mistry believes it is important to increase the tax exemptions on home loans and even a marginal increase will pep up the home-buyers sentiments. Considering the increase in house prices has been significantly higher than increase in exemptions, even a little raise of about Rs 50,000 will go a long way in improving sentiment, he says.11:45 am Macro outlook: Maintaining fiscal deficit at 3.5 percent of GDP is very important for the Indian economy, says Edward Teather, senior economist Asean & India of UBS Investment Bank. The current structure is such that the pressure of the 7th Pay Commission is much higher on the states rather than the Centre. In such a scenario, the Centre has to show the way forward, he says. However, there is also a need for investment lift-off and for that to happen, the government will have to mobilise the savings in the economy and make it available to the private sector, says Teather. He believes constraining consumption is the need of the hour. Meanwhile, Vivek Rajpal, rates strategist at Nomura India, says a 3.5 percent number will provide relief to the bond markets. A combination of 3.5 percent fiscal deficit, open market operations (OMO) and an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank will ensure that bond rates move closer to the 7.6 percent level.11:30 am Subsidy: Government plans to directly transfer the fertiliser subsidy to farmers and a pilot project for the same is also being considered in 20 districts.

The Indian rupee opened lower by 10 paise at 67.95 per dollar versus 67.85 Wednesday. The dollar was broadly lower after comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen gave investors no reason to change their minds that the next rate hike will be a long time coming.

Mohan Shenoi of Kotak Mahindra Bank said, ""Yellen's testimony to Congress acknowledges impact of global markets turmoil on US growth and inflation. Dollar continues to be under pressure against major currencies.""

As whispers mount that the Fed could implement negative interest rates as a way to goose economic activity, Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank has not completely researched whether that would be legal. Speaking during her semi-annual congressional testimony, Yellen said the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) discussed charging banks to hold excess reserves at the Fed but never fully researched the issue. Asked whether she foresees the Fed cutting rates after just hiking its interest rate target in December, Yellen said she did not expect that to happen anytime soon as she considers the risk of recession low.

Asian markets traded mostly down on Thursday as investors digested remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and oil remained volatile.

In the near-term, the Nifty can possibly rebound to 7550 and if the global rally continues then 7700 is also a possibility, says CNBC-TV18's Udayan Mukherjee. However, he adds that the current rally is only a relief rally. The trend, according to him, is on the way down with periodic upmoves. He believes the market is currently in the 'acceptance' phase. Earlier investors and traders alike were of the view that a China hard landing is unlikely, but now the market is slowly coming to terms with the fact that there are global problems, he explains. So, what the market is seeing right now is a bit of a dead cat bounce, he adds. Post this phase, comes the assessment phase, when the market will move in a range or a band. But after this phase, the market will either go into an overreaction, which is when prices can fall sharply, or it will be confident that the problems facing the market are manageable and hence consolidate.

Asian shares steadied in cautious early trade, as investors were reluctant to make any big moves amid volatile crude oil and before a widely anticipated US interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve later this week.

Markets were also focused on whether the People's Bank of China (PBOC) would continue to guide its currency lower, with traders wary about the central bank's intentions after it set the yuan/dollar official midpoint at 4-1/2-year lows in recent session.

Besides the direction of oil prices, the outlook for Fed monetary policy loomed large in the markets' collective consciousness. Investors have mostly priced in a rate hike this week, with the main question now hinging on how many increases will follow next year."

On Friday, the country's largest software services firm said that floods in Chennai are expected to have a ""material impact"" on TCS current quarter revenues.

Nomura has maintained neutral rating on TCS but slashed target price to Rs 2500 from Rs 2670 per share. It sees moderate second half of FY16. As per its estimates, its FY16 dollar revenue growth is seen at 7.8 percent from 8.4 percent earlier.

9:45 am Poll: The November Consumer Price Index (CPI) data that will be released today post market hours is expected to inch up as opposed to October. The consumer inflation has been rising for the past three months from 3.7 percent in July 2015 to 5 percent in October of 2015. November's expected CPI is likely to inch around 5.38 percent due to base effect of a lower October CPI (3.3 percent).

The core CPI is likely to come between 4.41 to 4.62 percent. Now the reason why we are expecting this inch up to continue will be one because of the base impact the CPI November of 2014 was 3.3 percent and food inflation was around 1.2 percent so because of that additionally because of pulses inflation which could possibly contribute or continue to rise would be one of the key reasons or the constituents in terms of what we could expect for the CPI data to inch up.

Dear Shareholder:For a company with as strong a manufacturing track record as Maruti has, to willingly cede ground to another manufacturer should be anathema - yet this is just what your company is proposing, by allowing Suzuki to own the Gujarat plant. Make no mistake, this vote is about the shifting power equation and whether shareholders will allow a manufacturer to continue to ‘manufacture and sell’ or let it shift gears, and ‘buy to sell.’ To put it simply, you - the shareholders of Maruti - need to decide whether Maruti will continue to remain a manufacturer of cars or will it become a glorified distributor. Equally important are the implications of this vote on family run firms and on other MNC’s. If shareholders agree to Suzuki doing owning the Gujarat plant, why should they not agree to the Tata’s, Munjal’s, Mahindra’s or the Bajaj families proposing the same? Will Glaxo or Nestlé or Holcim now set up fully owned subsidiaries and have their Indian arm only market the products? If so, it will spell doom for the Indian equity markets.Your company, Maruti currently has two facilities - in Gurgaon and in Manesar - which have a combined capacity to manufacture 1.55 mn cars. Your company planned to expand its capacities by setting up a third plant in Gujarat (1,500,000 cars annually – to be set up in a phased manner). However, in early 2014, Maruti took us all by surprise when it announced that, Suzuki (and not Maruti) will set up and own the Gujarat plant. Suzuki will manufacture the cars in Gujarat that will be purchased by Maruti at cost and be sold under the Maruti product portfolio. In order to execute this arrangement, your company now proposes to enter into two related party transaction contracts with Suzuki Motor Gujarat Private Limited (SMGPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corporation (Suzuki), and as required by the Companies Act, 2013, is seeking your approval for the following transactions:for manufacture and supply of vehicles for an initial period of 15 years. All goods will be sold at cost by SMGPL to Maruti with no profit or loss for SMGPL.for developing the plant on land owned by Maruti. As per the deed, SMGPL will pay Maruti an annual aggregate rental of Rs.49.9 mn for the land an initial period of 15 years.. Voting AGAINST this resolution means that Maruti will own the Gujarat plant and not Suzuki – it will not result in any stoppage of capacity creation at the Gujarat plant.IiAS has had reservations about this deal since it was first announced in January 2014 and continues to believe that the deal is not in Maruti’s long term interest. Its main contentions are in the open letter to shareholders that is attached.

So, both these items will be taken care of by this Rs 20,000 crore cushion. Hence, it is not necessary that OROP is going to have a sizeable fiscal impact, at least not in the current financial year.

10:20 am Oil volatile: The reason behind the fall and rise in oil prices yesterday, according to Miswin Mahesh of Barclays, is the fact that the Iranian nuclear agreement still needs to be approved within the Congress in the US. They have 60 days to do that. Despite US President Barack Obama firm statement that he will veto any opposition to it, it is still important. Secondly, even after the Congress approval in September, actual oil from Iran will hit the market only in the fourth quarter.

There are also a few other roadblocks to go through in terms of Iranian oil hitting the market. The first tranche that would hit the market would be the 40 million barrels of oil Iran has on oil tankers, says Mahesh. This will hit the market first after the European insurance sanctions are removed on tanker shipments, he told CNBC-TV18.

Iran has the fifth largest oil reserves in the world. Despite the fact that Iran will be opening its oil sector to foreign companies, oil contracts will play a key role here, he says. While foreign companies are extremely keen to go to Iran, a lot will depend on how attractive it will be for major oil companies around the world to go to there and start rejuvenating the oil fields, he adds.

New orders returned to positive territory at 50.3 and new export orders fell at a much slower pace, but companies stepped up layoffs, shedding jobs at the fastest pace in over six years, a trend which is sure to alarm Beijing.

The market saw some sharp cuts on Monday, dragged sharply by oil & gas, pharma, FMCG and banking stocks. The Sensex closed down 260.95 points or 0.9 percent at 27176.99 and the Nifty ended at 8213.80, down 91.45 points or 1 percent at 8213.80.

Poor performance by most companies in March quarter earnings has been wrecking investor sentiment. “Earnings have been disappointing so far. Investors should go through the earnings season and look for companies that show some sort of visibility,"" says analyst Dipan Mehta. According to him, at a fundamental level, even as many individual stocks have corrected 25-30 percent, there should be no urgency to buy stocks.

Market expert Ambareesh Baliga also feels one will see time wise correction and one must avoid catching the falling knife.

Meanwhile, earning specific stocks kept traders busy today with Maruti outperforming the market by its stellar March quarter numbers. The stock gained 3 percent as its Q4 profit rose a whopping 60.5 percent, supported by higher volumes and favorable foreign exchange. The profit increased to Rs 1,284 crore from Rs 800 crore in the year-ago period. Strong operational performance also boosted bottomline. Revenues increased by 12.5 percent to Rs 13,625 crore in the quarter ended March 2015 from Rs 12,101.4 crore in the same quarter last year.

Vedanta, Wipro, Bajaj Auto and Tata Motors were top gainers in the Sensex.

However, investors snubbed ICICI Bank on its worsening asset quality. It’s Q4 gross non-performing assets (NPA) jumped 75 basis points year-on-year (up 38 bps sequentially) to 3.78 percent. Though the private bank matched street expectations with the profit rising 10.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,922 crore in the quarter ended March 2015, the stock took a knock of 2 percent. Bank Nifty lost over 1 percent dragged by SBI and HDFC as well.

Kotak Mahindra began the day with some gains on listing on the bourse but soon lost steam thereafter. It has listed new equity shares of the merged entity on exchanges. As per the scheme of merger, shareholders of ING Vysya Bank received 725 shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank for 1,000 shares of ING Vysya Bank.

Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel slipped 3 percent ahead of announcing Q4 results tommorow. Analysts expect another lacklustre quarter for Bharti's Africa business; in fact this could be the weakest quarter historically.

Sharp depreciation of African currencies may impact the performance. Hence, dollar revenue may show a sharp decline. Citi estimates a 7.5 percent Q-o-Q decline while Kotak expects a 5 percent de-growth.

Midcaps and smallcaps also took a beating today as market fell sharply in the last few hours. BSE Midcap slipped 2 percent while BSE Smallcap fell 3 percent from previous close. Symphony, Strides Arcolab, Gujarat Gas, Vakrangee and Apollo Hospital were major laggards among the midcaps."

3:10 pm Banks to incur more cost: India's banks could see their lending-related costs rise by up to a fifth as a recent rule change means they must make bigger provisions for restructured debt, crimping their profits at a time when consumers and firms are starting to borrow more.

This could make banks cautious about lending, hurting an economy that is emerging from its weakest growth since the 1980s. The stricter provisioning norms may also affect the recovery chances of troubled borrowers as more loans are classified as bad instead of attempts to restructure them.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) ended last month what it called a period of ""forbearance"", dating back to the financial crisis. During this time, problematic loans that were being restructured required provisions amounting to only 5 percent of their value, instead of 15 percent for the loans classified as ""bad"".

""According to our calculations, a deficient monsoon, if it comes true, will shave off 0.50 percent from our GDP forecast of 7.9 percent for fiscal 2016,"" it said in a note.

Oil prices will reverse their recent gains as global crude inventories begin to increase again, with US crude likely to drop as far as USD 40 a barrel in the near-term, Goldman Sachs said.

Oil prices rose by almost a third between January and February on the back of Middle East supply disruptions, strong winter demand and high refinery margins. That followed a rout that had seen price falls of around 60 percent between June 2014 and January this year.

But Goldman said that ""the activity pull is sequentially weakening"" and that global crude inventories would therefore rise, pushing West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to $40 a barrel, levels last seen at the peak of the global financial crisis in late 2008, early 2009.

The rise in the provision of Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA), over which the ECB has control, is critical for Greece's banks, and gives Athens some leeway while it tries to negotiate a financing deal with European partners.

11:55 am India PMI: Growth in India's factory activity slipped in January from December's two-year high as new orders rose at a weaker rate despite factories keeping price increases to a minimum, a business survey showed on Monday.

Cooling growth and inflation could give the Reserve Bank of India reason to cut interest rates again in the coming months but any move may depend on the government's annual budget due on Feb. 28.

The HSBC Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, fell to a three-month low of 52.9 in January from December's two-year high of 54.5.

It has been above the 50 level, which denotes growth, since November 2013 but missed poll expectations for a smaller drop in January, to 53.5.

11:40 am Auto sales: Car market leader Maruti Suzuki sold 1.16 lakh units in January, a growth of 13.7 percent compared to 1.02 lakh units sold in the year-ago period driven by domestic as well as exports growth.

CLSA reiterates a buy rating and increased target price by 15 percent to Rs 2200 per share. It has also upgraded its FY16/17 EPS by 7/8 percent and feels that strong deals, hiring and margin levers, suggest continued earnings surprises and possibility of a re-rating.

Citi also maintains buy with an increased target of Rs 2175 from Rs 1980. Citing reasonable valuations HCL Tech is Citi’s only buy in the Indian IT services space.

The government will sell 31.58 crore shares with an option to sell additional 31.58 crore share, totaling 10 percent of the total paid up capital of the company.

The OFS will open on January 30 and floor price will be declared today.

JP Morgan feels that the short window for stake sale will save it from further erosion as it limits potential damage to the stock price to effectively one day, unlike in the past when the stake sale would be announced months before the actual sale, keeping investors away and pushing down the stock price in the run up to the stake sale.

However, the brokerage is underweight on the stock with a price target of Rs 325 per share as given the stake sale there is less room for a repeat of last year’s dividend.

In the February series, he sees continued correction or consolidation, but it may be a lot less volatile than the January series. He believes the Nifty can touch 9000, but not overshoot the mark.

Echoing similar sentiments, Parag Thakkar of HDFC Securities says most of the pre-Budget rally is already done with. He believes it to be a bottom up market. ""Within the same space there are winners and losers,"" he adds.

Rules have also been changed for asset finance companies, who until now could easily take public deposits -- they now have to obtain an investment-grade rating from a rating agency but this rule too is applicable from March 2016. The most important ones, though, are the changes in the bad loan rules. As of now, NBFCs mark a loan as bad loan only if the interest is not paid for six months while for banks it is three months.

The week ended October 31 punctured the hopes of fence-sitting potential investors that a correction might be underway.

Both Sensex and Nifty gained 3.5 percent this week ending at their all-time closing levels of 27,866 and 8,322, respectively. Despite sincere attempt, broader markets failed to match up to benchmarks; BSE small-cap and CNX mid-cap indices rose between 2.5-2.8% this week. Realty, metals, IT, capital goods and banking stocks were the top gainers.

Market experts across the spectrum are unanimous in their view that Indian market is poised for a long-term bull run helped by improving macros, easing inflation, falling crude oil prices and an improved sentiment.

Friday witnessed massive gains on bourses after Bank of Japan (BoJ) put the mojo back into stocks globally and on account of short-covering. BoJ unexpectedly announced an expansion in the pace of its quantitative easing program by 30 trillion yen to 80 trillion on Friday. Japan's key index Nikkei hailed the move with 5 percent up-move. Global markets also towed the line; London's FTSE index, French CAC 40 and German DAX rallied 1.1-2 percent higher. Asian markets were led by Japan. Globally, investors now expect Japan and Europe to fill the void in easy liquidity, created by US's exit earlier this week.

Back home, foreign investors re-emerged as net buyers in equities after selling in the past few weeks fretting over what US Federal Reserve's commentary might be on interest rate front. However, Fed in a statement later committed to keep interest rates at record low levels for a ""considerable period of time,"" which spurred a global rally. The US central bank also ended its historic bond buying program citing improved labour market conditions.

""FIIs have bought in quite aggressively in the index Futures. Their position as of now is about USD 1.7 billion, at the start of the October contract it was just about USD 900 million. In fact during the early weeks of October it had come down and thereafter they have really added on a lot. Similarly there was buying even in the underlying cash market yesterday. The Put protection which was about USD 3.6 billion at the start of the month for October remains more or less the same. It is spread quite nicely between 7600 to 8000 contract for Nifty strikes and therefore we believe that the momentum will continue as we head into November now,"" said Vineet Bhatnagar MD, PhillipCapital.

Also, Fed's hawkish stance on US economy eroded the safe haven appeal of gold and silver, which tumbled to multi-year lows.

Crude oil too continued on its downward trajectory; Brent crude was last seen trading at $85.48 down 0.9% at 1548 hours on Friday.

An improved outlook on US economy had it's rub-off on stocks of IT companies this week, which largely depend on US economy for their exports. Making a comeback, BSE IT index swelled 5 percent on improved sentiment; TCS, Infosys, HCL Technology and Tech Mahindra rallied 4-6 percent.

Top Nifty gainers this week were Cipla, L&T, Infosys, Tata Power, BHEL, Tech Mahindra, IDFC, Tata Steel, HDFC, Hindalco and GAIL, which surged between 6-10 percent.

Shares of realty stocks rallied this week after the government relaxed rules for foreign direct investment (FDI). BSE Realty index hoisted 4.5 percent this week; Sobha Developers, Oberoi Realty and DLF, HDIL rallied between 1-3 percent.

Among key earnings, from the FMCG space HUL, ITC, Nestle and Emami posted mixed September quarter earnings this week.

Credit Suisse thinks FMCG sector is in a sweet spot with an improving growth outlook, easing inputs and benign competitive intensity and hence HUL's personal care business should benefit from all these, valuations leave little room for upside.

HUL's EBITDA margin expanded by 50 basis points (bps) YoY despite a sharp 160 bps fall in gross margins, as advertising spend dipped due to benign competitive intensity. ""The fall in gross margins was unexpected and was driven by a low base for raw material costs and higher excise duty. With softening commodity prices now only starting to kick in, we expect gross margins to start improving from Q3,"" Credit Suisse said in a note.

ITC matched street expectations on profit front but topline and operational performance disappointed. Net profit climbed 8.7 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,425 crore supported by other income and higher revenue. The profit in the year-ago period was Rs 2,230.5 crore.

Among autos, M&M and Maruti posted strong results reflecting an improvement in the demand scenario.

Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) reported a 4.3 percent decline in standalone profit at Rs 947 crore for the quarter ended September 2014 compared to Rs 989.5 crore in the year-ago period; hit by weak operational performance despite higher other income

""Standalone numbers seem to be in-line with what I was expecting because there was muted growth on both auto and tractor side. So taking the cognizance of that fact, the revenue seems to be in-line with the numbers. However, on the PAT side, it is a beat,"" said Ajay Shethiya, VP - Auto & Auto Ancillary, in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

Maruti stock touched record high levels at Rs 3332.90 per share, up almost 3 percent intraday on Friday after analysts upped the target price post strong Q2 performance. Maruti Suzuki beat street expectations on Thursday with the second quarter net profit rising 28.8 percent to Rs 863 crore led by other income and higher revenue. Profit in the year-ago period was Rs 670.2 crore.

India's largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel's second quarter profit jumped 24.8 percent sequentially (higher-than-expected) to Rs 1,383.2 crore in July-September quarter, the highest quarterly profit since March 2011. Year-on-year growth in profit was 170.2 percent.

What's next

Economy is yet to match stock market’s stride, show September core sector numbers, released on Friday post market hours. The core sector comprising 8 industries like electricity, steel, cement, coal etc, grew 1.9 percent in September compared to 5.8 percent growth in August and 9 percent in the same period last year. This might give investors a reason to take some profits off the table on Monday.

In Q1FY15, credit growth was up 15 percent with retail up 26 percent Y-o-Y while corporate loan growth was 8 percent. Net interest margin is expected to be at 3.4 percent in Q2FY15, flat compared to previous quarter and up 10 basis points compared to same quarter last year.

9:30 am Cap infusion? The fiscal is likely to face pressure as demands for additional funds are already knocking at the government's door.

Hence, there could be a need for supplementary demand for grants.

Significantly, the Cabinet nod will also include further capital infusion over a four-year period into these banks.

Maruti Suzuki is caught in a race against time. The carmaker’s recent decision to let its Japanese parent set up a manufacturing plant in Gujarat has riled the country’s top fund managers who have invested in it, amid concerns that the move would impact the firm’s profitability.

But according to corporate-governance experts, the timing of the deal is such that, as it stands today, minority shareholders such as fund managers will have little say in the company’s business decision even if they believe it is against their interests.

In January, Maruti announced that Suzuki would develop a plant on a piece of land in Gujarat that Maruti owns and had intended to develop. According to the deal, Suzuki’s wholly-owned subsidiary would manufacture cars only for Maruti and as per its requirements and would sell the vehicles to the Indian company on a cost-plus-capex basis.

The move led to investor concerns that Maruti -- whose excellent financial shape would have enabled it to carry out the transaction by itself -- will end up funding the plant’s expansion without having its possession and news reports are abuzz that top fund houses have approached market regulator Sebi accusing Maruti of handing out favours to its parent company at the cost of minority shareholders.

However, experts are of the view that corporate governance norms -- as they exist in the Companies Act, 1956, which is in force today -- mandate that any “related party transaction” requires an approval only from the company’s audit committee.

Under the 1956 act, an RPT is one in which two companies share directors, according to a Business Standard report.

But Sebi’s new corporate governance norms, modeled on the Companies Act 2013, come into effect in October and require a company to seek a majority vote from minority shareholders on all material RPTs -- or more than half of votes from owners of the 44 percent stake Suzuki does not have in Maruti.

The Companies Act 2013 defines a material RPT as one which, in aggregate, exceeds 5 percent of the annual turnover or 20 percent of the net worth of the company during the financial year, whichever is higher.

Amit Tandon, managing director, IIAS, a corporate governance advisory told Mint: “It is expected that purchase agreements between Maruti and Suzuki Gujarat will exceed this limit and hence will come under Sebi’s purview.”

But it appears that if Maruti closes the deal before October, there will be little minority shareholders can do about it, except continuing to engage with the company to try and change its mind or, worse, sell the stock and exit.

Former Sebi director Gupta, who now runs a proxy advisory firm, told Business Standard that as a good corporate governance measure, Maruti should voluntarily seek minority shareholders approval.

But given Maruti’s obvious intent to go ahead with the deal even in the face of much investor chagrin, it looks unlikely."

1:50 pm FM meets PSU Banks CEOs: FM says growth in deposits and credit up to December-end is higher on yearly basis.. He has asked PSU banks to focus on sectors where growth is weak but feels that biggest challenge PSU banks are facing is non-performing assets (NPAs).

Here is what he said:



PSU banks' NPAs high in large corporate sector



NPAs have come down in real estate sector



NPAs higher as they are system generated, no longer hidden



PSU banks are focussing on recovery of NPAs



April-December actual bad loan recovery at Rs 18,933 crore



Govt will provide additional capital to PSU banks



Banks must look to retain earnings to infuse capital



Give more capital to help PSU Banks meet basel norms



RBI will issue bank licences before March 31



Tata Communications' stock advanced as much as 2 percent intraday on Wednesday as the company has signed a collaboration agreement with Turkey-based telecom operator Turkcell Superonline. Both will set up a multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) node in Istanbul.

In case the election results are positive then it could see a further run up but beyond that the market will focus on execution of policies that the new government will announce, he adds.

If a pro-growth government comes to power then cyclicals-trade would come into focus because some of the money that is focused on defensives like IT, Pharma etc would shift into cyclicals like cheaper private banks, larger PSU banks, capital goods, some oil and gas companies says Pai.

11:50 am Interview: The finance ministry’s approval of Rangarajan Committee’s suggestion on rescheduling the premium payments for road projects, although a good step, may not mean significant change for those projects that were bidded aggressively by the construction companies or those that have been unviable says KK Mohanty, MD, Gammon Infrastructure in an interview to CNBC-TV18’s Latha Venkatesh and Sonia Shenoy. “The premium rescheduling norms are too little too late”, he says.

According to him since the road sector is facing challenging times and is already in doldrums, most of the projects will go in for re-bidding even post new norms because out of 45 Projects awarded in 2011-13, only few have started work.

However, Gammon Infra can see additional cash flow for few more years if Vijayawada Eluru Gundugolanu project's premium is deferred, says Mohanty. The company pays a premium of Rs 57 crore per year for the project. The situation could get more clear post the new government coming in feels Mohanty.

The HSBC Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by Markit, rose to 48.8 in February from 48.3, but remained stuck below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for the eighth month.

India's services sector accounts for about 60 percent of gross domestic product. The weak PMI follows lower-than-expected GDP growth of 4.7 percent at the end of 2013, suggesting there may be worse to come for the economy as India heads into an election due by May.

2:00 Should Sebi intervene?Just as the dust was beginning to settle on the Fresenius Kabi delisting controversy, another MNC's action has reignited the debate on whether the delisting guidelines are being gamed by promoters looking for a cheap exit.

AstraZeneca Pharma today said that its board would be meeting on Wednesday to consider a proposal to delist the company. The foreign parent holds 75 percent in the company, having reduced stake from 90 percent in May last year through an offer for sale (OFS) to institutional investors at Rs 620 per share. AstraZeneca had taken the OFS route to comply with the Sebi rule mandating listed companies to maintain minimum 25 percent public shareholding.

To delist, the foreign parent now needs to buy an additional 15 percent from investors. Under current rules, promoters with less than 90 percent stake looking to delist, have to make an offer for minimum 50 percent of the outstanding equity and take their stake to 90 percent. For promoters holding 90 percent and above, the offer has to be for a minimum of 50 percent of the outstanding equity.

Crimea was gifted to Ukraine by a Soviet leader about 60 years ago, but tensions simmered in the region when pro-Russia leader Viktor Yanukovych was ousted on February 21.

Equity benchmarks gained 2 percent during the week, mainly helped by benign newsflow in global markets even as many experts cautioned that US equities may have peaked out. Brokers say global cues will decide near term trend, and a sell-off in the US could spell bad news for emerging markets including India. US Fed chairperson Janet Yellen said the central bank was likely to keep trimming monthly bond purchases, even as macro data would be watched to check if recent weakness in the economy was temporary.

The BSE Sensex ended the week at 21,120.12, up 419.37 points over last Friday, and the Nifty rose 121.50 points to 6,276.95.

Third quarter GDP growth of 4.7 percent released post market hours Friday, however, was way short of the 5.2 percent growth that the Finance Minister had predicted for the December and March quarters, in his Interim Budget Speech last week.

In key developments during the week, BJP leader Narendra Modi addressed industry captains at the India Economic Convention 2014 in New Delhi, assuring them of simpler laws and speedier decision making. But market experts said a NDA win was largely discounted by the market, though there could be poll-related volatility between now and till the results are out.

He says a little bit of election beta rally has picked up steam in the last three-four weeks. The portfolios need to add a bit of an election beta and reasonably priced election beta - investors don’t need to go out there and buy some high risk stuff but reasonably priced stocks, he adds.

“What one can expect and one should expect reasonably is 10-15 percent return at the index level. That would probably be election agnostic with accounting for some volatility in the middle of the year if we do not get a good election result,” he adds.

"February 28, 2014 04:32 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/shareholder-activism-are-fund-managers-finally-acting-1110983.html,"Indian mutual fund companies have been known to turn a blind eye when it comes to acting on shareholder resolutions put out by companies.

Despite holding significant proxy voting power in the form of stocks they own on behalf of individual investors, fund managers in Indian asset management companies are known to shy away from taking on corporates even if perceived-to-be-shareholder-unfriendly decisions are taken.

Consider this: a study by corporate-governance research firm, inGovern, showed mutual funds had voted against only 1.5 percent of all shareholder resolutions in 2013 while abstaining from more than half the resolutions (51.5 percent) on offer and agreeing with the rest.

But fund managers may finally be moving towards playing their part as caretakers of minority shareholders’ interest, if recent media reports are anything to go by.

A host of fund managers recently met with the Maruti management, highlighting their concerns on a deal that the automaker struck with Suzuki, and letting the parent company set up a manufacturing plant for the Indian automaker.

Reports said that the fund managers voiced their displeasure over the deal in a meeting that turned out to be a “stormy” affair.

More power to managers

While this is not the first time a domestic institutional investor has stood up against corporates over decisions it perceives as poor – in one instance, the Life Insurance Corporation had voted against Ambuja Cements picking up stake in ACC – such activism in the Indian mutual fund industry is relatively new.

The reasons for managers being apathetic towards serious proxy voting are many.

About three-fourth of mutual-fund industry assets are owned by corporates that invest their surplus cash in liquid/debt schemes, and so many fund managers are wary of rubbing company managements the wrong way.

Plus, fund managers cannot hope to exert enough influence over the way companies take business decisions or punch above their weight. After all, considering India’s market capitalization at Rs 70 trillion, about 70 percent (or nearly Rs 50 trillion) is owned by promoters. Of the remaining Rs 20 trillion, nearly Rs 2 trillion in assets are owned by equity funds. So Indian funds are too small to matter or wield any say in the way business decisions are taken.

Most managers say an easier way out for them if they entirely do not agree with a company’s decision is exit the stock than fight.

But matters like CEO compensation or other acts that do not necessarily warrant an exit but impact shareholder wealth should certainly be taken up with more gusto by fund managers.

Given the way shareholder activism has evolved in developing countries such as US where activist hedge fund investors have taken on behemoths such as Apple and Microsoft over business decisions and have even managed to obtain a seat on boards, one would feel Indian institutions are long way off from acting the way they should.

Perhaps the Maruti development could signal the start of a journey in that direction.

Tata Motors was in focus today ahead of its December quarter earnings, which were announced after market hours.

2:00 pm Market outlook: Concerns relating to Chinas economy and tapering will cause serious jitters in emerging market equities in the near-term, but India is on a better footing courtesy steps taken by the central bank and government to manage current account deficit (CAD), Saurabh Mukherjea, CEO, Institutional Equities, Ambit Capital said. Structurally, Indian equities will be driven by local events like general elections and macro-economic data in the second half of the year, he added.

Though broader EM jitters are likely to hold India back in the near-term, the downside in Indian equities looks modest from current levels, he told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.

Maruti Suzuki’s top management held a closed-door meeting with analysts recently to explain its recent decision to let its Japanese parent Suzuki set up a manufacturing plant in Gujarat but doubts continue to linger.Last week, Maruti announced its parent would set up a wholly-owned subsidiary, Suzuki Gujarat Ltd, that would build a Rs 3,000 crore plant. The unit would become operational by 2017-18 and produce 2,50,000 cars, it said.As per the terms, Suzuki would lease land from Maruti and would manufacture cars only for the latter as per its demands and sell them for “zero profit”, the company’s release said at the announcement.On the face of it, the move appeared like a win-win for Maruti. Chairman RC Bhargava likened it to “someone else putting up a plant free of cost for us,” when, in an interview with CNBC-TV18, he was asked why the company did not choose to build the unit by itself given its Rs 7,500-crore cash chest and debt-free status.Some analysts see this as a move by Japanese Suzuki to invest further in its subsidiary (since profits from the Gujarat plant would go to Maruti in which Suzuki owns 56 percent) and put to better use its own Rs 25,000-crore equivalent cash, given the slowness in its home market.

Also read: Guj plant will take only Maruti orders: Co tells analystsBut other complexities in the deal, including a key clause that says Maruti would pay “cost plus incremental capex” for cars produced at the Gujarat unit, have had analysts concerned though many are still maintaining a positive outlook on the stock.“There are doubts regarding the funding of future capacity expansion,” brokerage firm Nomura said in a note after meeting with the company.In essence, Maruti is getting only the first 2,50,000 cars at a cost that would have been the same had it chosen to produce them at its own plant. But by adding incremental cost of capex, cars produced beyond the initial capacity are being paid for by Maruti itself. “Essentially, Maruti is funding the growth of the Gujarat plant without owning the asset at the end of its 15-year agreement period,” Deutsche Bank said in a report.Also, if Maruti is billed for future capacity expansions, its own profitability could be impacted depending on annual capex requirements, Nomura said. This would also make it difficult for analysts to value the stock using traditional models such as price-to-equity or EV/EBITDA and may prompt the need to look closer into the company’s free cash flows, it added.“The specifics on how the second and third phases of expansion, where internal cash generation will not be sufficient, will be done are still not clear as the final agreement has not yet been signed,” analysts at Credit Suisse said. “While the move does raise some questions, Chairman Bhargava’s strong intent on protecting minority shareholders’ rights gives us comfort.”

The capital Maruti will save by not investing its own money initially can put to use in other areas such as marketing and distribution, Kotak pointed out, adding that it would not be overtly concerned about the deal as long as the company was earning a ""desirable"" return on capital."

11:50 am FM's opinion: The Finance Ministry on Thursday said the US Federal Reserve’s decision to trim its monetary stimulus will not affect the Indian markets and all steps would be taken by the RBI and the government to ensure financial stability.

“Both the government of India and the Reserve Bank of India will continue to remain vigilant and will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that there is stability in the financial markets,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement.

The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday decided to cut its bond purchases by another USD 10 billion. It has now decided to purchase USD 65 billion per month of mortgage-backed securities and longer-term treasury securities as against USD 75 billion per month earlier.

“This decision was expected and should not in anyway surprise or affect the Indian markets. However, it may be noted that $65 billion is not a small sum and will continue to infuse a large amount of liquidity into the world markets,” the statement added.

Continuing his bearish tone, Woods added that the Indian equity market could head to August lows. “The risk reward at the moment for holding Indian equities given potential upside and downside is skewed to the latter,” he added. He sees the Sensex finding support at 18,000 levels.

10:59am Gammon talks to CNBC-TV18

There is no demand for road investment or road project either from the lender or from the investor side. Aimed perhaps as a push to the sector, the government decided late last night to allow road companies to swap equity, to selloff their equity provided the lenders agree.

But KK Mohanty, MD, Gammon Infrastructure says these are just procedural simplifications. Before this an environment needs to be created where the road projects remain or become economically viable, he says.

He says if issues related to land acquisitions, collecting toll (what is happening in Maharashtra) and other such administrative hurdles continue to result in project delays, the present negative sentiment about growth projects will become a long term problem.

He does not think anybody is optimistic about the situation - there are no buyers. It can only help in internal reorganization within the group or companies, he adds. As far as banks are concerned, he feels they are already saddled with bad projects, so they may utilize this opportunity to improve their position with a better promoter, or a better structure. But he does not see a real transaction happening at this point in time.

While the US Federal Reserve will pay heed to macro data before taking a decision on tapering for the next few months, Grace Tam, global market strategist, JPMorgan Asset Management believes it will taper its quantitative analysis (QE) by USD 10 billion.

Speaking to CNBC-TV18, Tam says the market expects a very slow pace of tapering due to which US treasury yields are falling a little.

Meanwhile, Tam downplays the emerging market (EM) currency contagion. He says the fall seen is only restricted to Argentina and Turkey which have high inflation.

“But we still think this is not a really serious problem because those like Turkey, Argentina are very small EMs, they are not going to affect the whole world. It is more likely a fundamental affect,” adds Tam.

Equity benchmarks extended fall for the third consecutive session on Tuesday after the RBI unexpectedly hiked policy rates to counter inflation.

The 30-share BSE benchmark fell as much as 153 points intraday before recovering to close with 23.94 points loss at 20,683.51. This was in addition to 666-point fall in previous two sessions following global weakness on account of steep fall in emerging market currencies.

The 50-share Nifty declined 9.60 points to 6,126.25 after hitting an intraday low of 6,085.95.

The recovery in the market may be in anticipation of lower chance of further rate hike, experts believe, but they have not completely ruled out rate hike as the decision is depend on CPI inflation.

“The fact that the market has not reacted negatively is because the governor has hinted that we won’t need any more rate hikes,” Gautam Trivedi, managing director and head of equities at Religare Capital Markets said.

Reserve Bank of India in its third quarter monetary policy review hiked repo rate, the rate at which banks borrow money from RBI, by 25 basis points to 8 percent. Accordingly, reverse repo rate, at which RBI borrows money from banks, increased by 25 basis points.

It was against the consensus estimates of no hike in policy rates by RBI on January 28.

“The rate hike is a major surprise, given that industry as well as the market was looking for a pause. The only positive is that the move will help support the rupee,” Trivedi said. The rupee appreciated 59 paise to 62.51 against the US dollar.

The major reason for rate hike is that consumer price index inflation remains above 9 percent though vegetable prices have moderated in December.

Meanwhile, the RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has accepted the recommendations of the Urjit Patel committee, which targets CPI inflation below 8 percent by January 2015 and below 6 percent by January 2016.

The central bank also raised marginal standing facility rate, at which banks borrow funds overnight from RBI against approved government securities, by 25 bps to 9 percent while the bank kept cash reserve ratio, the amount of funds that the banks have to keep with the RBI, unchanged at 4 percent.

In case of further rate hike, Rajan said the extent and direction of further policy steps will be data dependent, though if the disinflationary process evolves according to this baseline projection, further policy tightening in the near term is not anticipated at this juncture.

Nomura expects interest rates to continue to inch higher and sees another 25 bps repo rate hike to 8.25 percent in January-June period of 2014.

Meanwhile, after the RBI policy, now all eyes are on FOMC meeting that will start today for two days. The street will watch out for tapering.

Bankex, which fell over a percent post rate hike, recovered nicely to close 0.3 percent down. Axis Bank was down over 3 percent and HDFC Bank slipped 0.7 percent while rival ICICI Bank gained 0.9 percent.

Maruti Suzuki was the biggest loser, falling 8 percent amid hefty volumes after the board approved Gujarat unit expansion. But chairman RC Bhargava clarified that the expansion will be funded by Suzuki and the company will not lose earnings on investments.

The third quarter numbers of the country’s largest car maker were higher than analysts’ expectations. Net profit grew 1.6 percent sequentially (36 percent year-on-year) to Rs 681 crore as against forecast of Rs 636 crore.

Shares of Infosys, Sun Pharma, Cipla and Hindustan Unilever were down between 1-2.5 percent.

However, metals stocks bucked the trend with the BSE Metal index rising 1.7 percent. Tata Steel, Sesa Sterlite and Hindalco gained 2-3.5 percent.

Auto, capital goods and realty stocks too rebounded on hopes of no further rate hike by RBI. Tata Motors climbed 2.4 percent and BHEL was up 1 percent."

3:55 pm Subsidy woes: The government has ordered Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) to pay a near-record Rs 13,764 crore as fuel subsidy for the December quarter, a move that will dent the firm's profitability, reports PTI.

Oil and gas producers ONGC and Oil India Ltd bear a portion of the losses that fuel retailers incur on selling some fuels at subsidised rates. The government also offers the oil refiners a cash subsidy as compensation.

The Oil Ministry this week asked ONGC and OIL to give Rs 15,937.59 crore to make up for 40% of the Rs 39,725 crore revenue that retailers lost on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene at government-controlled rates in the October-December quarter, official sources said.

3:35 pm Stock call on Maruti: SP Tulsian of SP Tulsian.com told CNBC-TV18, advises to remain invested in Maruti Suzuki India. ""I don’t think that one should go by the quarterly numbers every time because we have been hearing the news of Suzuki contemplating to increase their stake in the company maybe to 75 percent. If that doesn’t happen in the near-term, it is surely going to happen maybe in this next three-four months and again we will see some kind of news coming in,"" he said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

He says that though there maybe some shrinkage in the margin but overall the bottomline is likely to be better, topline is going to show the growth. ""We are seeing some kind of lull passing through the passenger vehicle segments but Maruti is the leader in that segment. If one wishes to go for the profit booking, Rs 1,800 and above could be the level where he/she can again review the investment,"" he added.

3:25 pm Commodity check: Brent futures rose to USD107 a barrel on Tuesday as the steepest fall in three weeks prompted fresh buying, with concerns of turmoil in emerging economies and a slowdown in China keeping the gains in check, reports Reuters.

Oil also drew support from expectations of a steep fall in US distillate inventories, which would indicate ongoing robust demand for heating oil because of bitter winter cold in northern countries. That helped crude futures diverge from Asian shares, which remained near five-months lows.

3:15 pm Bankers' take on the policy: Banks are unlikely to hike their lending and deposit rates on the back of the surprise rate hike by the Reserve Bank of India, says country’s largest lender State Bank of India. The RBI unexpectedly raised its policy interest rate on Tuesday by 25 basis points (bps) but said that if consumer price inflation eases as projected, it does not foresee further near-term tightening. Although the move was unexpected, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan softened its impact by saying he did not foresee further near-term tightening if consumer price inflation eases, according to a central bank statement.

Next to companies with dollar revenues, those that stand to benefit from rural consumption are turning out to be the flavour of the season.

They see the uptrend in September wage growth sustaining.""Real rural wage growth is now back to around 4 percent levels from sub-2 percent in July that it had dipped to. We expect it to stay at 4-5 percent for the next 1-2 years, and continue to drive strong rural consumption growth,"" write Mishra and Shankar in their report.While companies are bemoaning the state of the economy as a whole, they are happy with their rural market performance.""In our recently concluded CIO trip, we heard from almost all companies ( Maruti HDFC Bank ) that despite the broader weakness, the rural part of their operations had not seen any slowdown,"" says the Credit Suisse note.The brokerage rates Maruti as being “best placed among carmakers to withstand the sustained slowdown in middle-income consumption.” Other favourites include, ITC Marico and Godrej Consumer Products , which according to Mishra-Shankar, stand to gain the most from low-end consumption.And while there questions about the sustainability of rural consumption growth, given rising inflation, Credit Suisse feels the pick-up in real wages should alleviate such concerns.Last week, brokerage house Ambit had a similar bullish report on the rural economy.The rural demand story is likely to be a theme that is likely to persist beyond 2HFY14 owing to certain critical changes that have transpired in India over the past five years, wrote Ritika Mankar Mukherjee of Ambit in her wrote.Rising penetration of banks, electrification and sanitation have been catalysts of rural growth, but there are five fundamental triggers that have transformed the rural landscape, according to Mukherjee:* The road connectivity boom* The silent telecom revolution* The dramatic increase in land prices* The rise and rise of blue-collar wages* The increase in social spending by states and the Centre Bajaj Auto Ramco Cement , Bharti Airtel, Idea Dish TV , and Hathway are the stocks that Ambit sees benefiting from growth in rural consumption."

Snapping a nine-month streak of decline, domestic passenger car sales grew by 15.37 percent to 1,33,486 units in August this year, compared to 1,15,705 units in the same month last year.

Industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), however, played down the feat saying the growth was mainly due to low base effect as a result of the month-long lockout last year at the country's largest car maker

Maruti Suzuki

India (MSI) Manesar plant.

Toyota may consider a price hike starting Oct



""This (growth) is not a reflection of the market conditions. This is mainly due to Maruti's numbers compared to last year. The tough market conditions still remain. Interest rates are high, fuel prices continue to be high while sentiments are extremely low,"" SIAM Deputy Director General Sugato Sen told reporters here.



He said the positive growth seen in August is unlikely to be sustained in September and a recovery in the market is likely to happen only in the next couple of quarters.



""For this fiscal, we are staring down at a negative growth of car sales. If we have to match last year's 2.7 million units, we need to be selling over two lakh units each month but in the last three months, we have sold less than that,"" Sen added.



In August, market leader MSI doubled its domestic car sales at 63,499 units as against 31,653 in the same month last year. The company had declared a month-long lockout at its Manesar plant in August 2012 following a violent labour unrestin which a senior executive was killed.

Hyundai Motor India Ltd registered a marginal increase during the month at 28,281 units as against 28,192 units last year. Tata Motors saw its sales plunge by 50.57 percent to 8,761 units as against 17,727 units in August last year.



Another homegrown major,

Mahindra & Mahindra

, which mostly sells utility and sports utility vehicles, saw its domestic passenger vehicles sales decline by 25.45 percent to 18,137 units during the month.



According to the latest SIAM figures, motorcycle sales grew by 3.82 percent last month to 7,95,378 units from 7,66,127 units in the same month of previous year.



""The good monsoon has had an impact on rural sales of two-wheelers, specially that of motorcycles. We expect this to continue and the rural demand could also have a slight positive impact on car sales,"" Sen said.



During August this year, two-wheeler market leader Hero MotoCorp posted 1.61 percent increase in its domestic sales at 3,95,180 units as against 3,88,903 units last year.



Rival

Bajaj Auto

saw its bike sales decline by 22.6 percent to 1,50,989 units as compared to 1,95,093 units last August. Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India's (HMSI) motorcycle sales grew by 48.68 percent to 1,44,039 units as against 96,876 units in the year ago month."

The slowdown in the automotive industry is no longer just a bump on the road. And as manufacturers look to cut back on production to bring it in line with sluggish demand, they have also started cutting down on their workforce. CNBC-TV18's Ronojoy Banerjee and Sunanda Jayaseelan report that the effects of this are being felt by component suppliers as well.

The automobile sector is taking corrective action by cutting back on production to align it with slowing demand.It began in the passenger vehicle segment with Maruti halting production of petrol and diesel engines at its plants. M&M , which had been a little insulated due to its SUV product portfolio, is also feeling the pressure. In June, when sales fell, the company had to lay off close to 500 workers. Says Pawan Goenka, president - automotive business, M&M, ""After reducing employee strength by 400-50, more cuts in employee strength are due if shutdown in production continues after July.""The commercial vehicle space has not been spared either. Sales fell over 8 percent in June, making it the 16th straight month of falling sales. Commercial vehicle major Ashok Leyland was amongst the worst hit and responded by reportedly laying off around 1,300 temporary workers.No surprise then, that component suppliers are also feeling the heat. Says Sunder Rajan, CEO, Sona Koyo , ""We are sill watching. There could be correction in the form of layoffs in October for our company too. This correction is to be done in support functions not directly related to manufacturing.""So far, the damage has been restricted to contract workers. But Sona Koyo says most auto component manufacturers are staying away from any fresh hiring. And unless demand picks up, there seems to be no reversal on the cards."

Benchmark indices are likely to be rangebound in the near future, in the absence of any significant triggers, feels Kirti Doshi of Antique Stock Broking.""There is no case to be bearish, but till there is some clarity on the rupee and politics (because of the general elections), there is no case to be gung-ho either despite attractive valuations,"" said Doshi in a free-wheeling chat with moneycontrol.com.Doshi feels the first quarter corporate earnings season is unlikely to throw up too many surprises, positive or negative. Expectations from the June quarter numbers are low , with most analysts estimating aggregate sales growth to be at its lowest in many quarters.""An overwhelming majority of the stocks are already reflecting earnings expectations,” Doshi said, adding “…that explains why some stocks are still expensive despite the recent market correction and the rest are not finding any takers.""Doshi says there could be a few positive surprises, but the impact on sentiment would be limited.“A handful of stocks may surprise, but they are not the market,” he said, adding that investors were buying many shares at expensive valuations, as a defensive bet more than anything else.Attractive valuations in themselves may not be a trigger to start buying shares.""You may have stocks available at dirt cheap. But 85 percent of these stocks are dependent on government policy actions. Till you have some clarity on that front, investors are not going to bite,"" Doshi says.He points to the Jet-Etihad deal, which has not been approved three months after it was announced in late April.""Such inter-ministerial wrangling is further undermining sentiment,"" he says.Doshi, who has now been in the stock market for around 35 years now, says this is the worst bear market as far as he can recall.""Things were bad in the mid-90s, in 2001 and in 2008 as well. But what makes it different this time is the massive debt on the books of companies. That was not the case in the previous bear phases,”""Doshi says.And he says the key indices are not adequately reflecting the turmoil in the broader market.""You have a couple of dozen stocks that investors are focused on, and these stocks are not seeing any big moves on either side,"" he says.Doshi says he will selectively buy Hero Honda, Maruti, Bajaj Auto, TCS, HDFC and IndusInd Bank, and cement stocks.""None of these stocks are exactly cheap, but we will look to accumulate them at attractive entry points,"" Doshi said.He is among the minority who are bullish on the cement sector.""I would look at them as a replacement cost play than a pure earnings play,"" he says. santosh.nair@network18online.com"

Brokerage house Motilal Oswal sees HCL Tech and Hindalco as the key beneficiaries of rupee depreciation, while Bharti Airtel and Maruti Suzuki are seen the key losers.Following is the brokerage’s snapshot of how the companies stand to gain/lose* For Hindalco, rupee depreciation will bolster its standalone revenues which are mainly dollar linked, while most of its operating expenditure remains stable. Accordingly, our EPS estimates for FY15 is increased by 20 percent to Rs 20/share. HCL Tech has the maximum EPS sensitivity to movements in currency. This is partly due to the higher operating leverage, resulting in 11 percent change in EPS. Maruti Suzuki and Bharti Airtel will be negatively impacted due to rupee depreciation.* Maruti Suzuki has hedged 40 percent JPY (yen)/USD exposure (including indirect and royalty) at 95-98 levels for FY14 (90-92 for 4QFY13), while for INR/USD leg is open. The recent pull back in USD/JPY (thereby impacting rates for further hedges) coupled with INR depreciation would impact Maruti Suzuki’s FY14E/15E EPS by 6.8/7.7 percent"

Brokerage house Motilal Oswal Securities has downgraded its FY14 and FY15 earnings estimates for car-maker Maruti Suzuki by 11-12 percent, citing weak demand for its diesel variants as the key reason. The brokerage has retained its 'buy' rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 2033.

""While demand for petrol segment seems to be stabilizing (on a low base), demand for diesel segment has weakened, post correction in fuel price disparity. Adverse mix (lower diesel share) could impact Maruti Suzuki's (MSIL) margins,"" said the Motilal Oswal Securities note to clients.Analysts Jinesh Gandhi and Chirag Jain estimate 30-40 basis point EBITDA margin and 7 percent EPS impact for 5 percent change in diesel volumes.""Weak demand and lower diesel share to drive discounts higher by Rs 2,200/unit for 1HFY14E v/s 4QFY13 levels,"" said the MOSL note.Also, the brokerage feels that the recent steep depreciation in the rupee to the dollar would dilute benefit of favorable yen/dollar movement.""While MSIL has hedged around 40 percent of FY14 JPY (yen)/USD exposure, its INR(rupee)/USD leg is unhedged,"" said the MOSL note."

BE CAUTIOUS, with the change in planetary position, deception along with erratic behavior will continue. Deception does not necessarily mean - down trend, but going against the pace of market.

Lord Saturn is in retrograde position from 18th February to 8th July 2013.

Following sectors will be getting astrological support:

PAINTS sector will also receiving strong astrological support. Buy Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac Paints etc on decline.

LIQUOR & LEATHER sector will also continue getting astro support. Buy United Spirits & Bata India on dips.

New Vikram Samvat 2070 (Hindi/ Hindu New Year) have started from 11th April 2013. With commencement of new Samvat, astrologically, based on planetary position, some new sectors start out performing, while others remain laggard. According to our experience of last more than 13 years, stocks of such sectors outperform resulting in exorbitant gains, irrespective of the behavior of Market. They are called the sectors of Samvat. Last year when new Samvat started - Gem & Jewellery, Media & Entertainment & Paints sectors were sectors of Samvat 2069. In Gem & Jewellery – Gitananjali Gems, Tribhuvan Das Bhimjee & Vaibhav Global shot by 110-290 percent. In Media & Entertainment – Sun TV, Zee TV, Hathway, TV 18 & PVR moved up by 65-135 percent & among Paints sector – Asian Paints, Berger Paints & Shalimar Paints appreciated by 55-97 percent. Tata Global went up by 80 percent during last one year.

Take the case of Sugar sector, which has been continuously getting positive news since last more than 6 months & despite decontrol - failed to outperform, simply because this sector is not receiving any astrological support.

To know which sectors will outperform in current Samvat & to achieve maximum gains please contact us.

Always be very cautious, when some main planets i.e. Rahu, Ketu, Jupiter & Lord Saturn are changing their houses. It may be that certain sectors which were continue sly getting support for long time may stop receiving support due to change in position by above planets & stocks of those sectors starts coming down, resulting in losses. This is common reason, why most people loss money.

One should trade only in the stocks of that sectors which are getting very strong astrologically support. Sectors which get very strong ASTROLOGICAL support are not normally affected by downfall in the market."

said that, ""While Asia-specific factors look worse this time around like North Korea and portfolio flows moving to Japan instead of Non-Japan Asia, we believe European tail risks and a better US recovery compensate for those factors. For India, price-to-book has dropped to 1.94x. While this is well above the 2008-09 lows, we do note that India has more recently troughed at 1.9x book.""said that, ""Earnings should decline by 3.5% in Q4 with broad based growth deceleration.

Japanese auto giant Suzuki Motor Corp's stake in subsidiary Maruti Suzuki has gone up to 56.21 percent after merger of its engine and transmission maker Suzuki Powertrain into India's largest car maker.

In a filing to the BSE today, Maruti Suzuki India ( MSI ) said Suzuki Motor Corporation's (SMC) stake in MSI has increased to 56.2 percent from 54.2 percent due to a share swap agreement with the domestic car market leader to acquire Suzuki Powertrain India Ltd (SPIL).Prior to the merger, SMC held 70 percent stake in SPIL, while the rest was held by MSI.In June last year, MSI had announced plan to merge SPIL with itself in order to prepare itself to meet increasing demand for diesel vehicles. At that time, SPIL was supplying 3 lakh diesel engines and transmissions every year to MSI.As per the merger agreement, the swap ratio was fixed at 1:70, which meant SMC received one share of MSI of Rs 5 each for every 70 shares of Rs 10 each it held in SPIL.MSI made a fresh issue of 13.17 million shares to SMC in lieu of the Japanese parent's 70 percent holding in SPIL. As per the understanding, there was no cash outflow from MSI as the merger was effected through a share swap agreement.SPIL's turnover in 2011-12 stood at Rs 4,550 crore with a net profit of Rs 150 crore. It also had a debt of Rs 550 crore, which went into MSI's book.Shares of MSI were trading 0.10 percent up at Rs 1,281 apiece on BSE during late afternoon."

The violence at Maruti Suzuki India's Manesar plant in July was not instigated from outside, but was due to internal issues between management and workers, according to the chargesheet filed by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) formed to probe the incident.

Charges against 145 persons have been framed after interviewing 300 witnesses by the Haryana Police. ""The chargesheet was filed last week. It was found that the violence was not instigated from outside but was due to the union trying to show solidarity with workers,"" deputy commissioner of police Maheshwar Dayal told PTI.""It was more of an internal issue between the management and the workers,"" he said, adding that involvement of Naxal elements into the violence was also ruled out. When contacted, Maruti Suzuki India spokesperson declined to comment.Dayal further said: ""Chargesheets have been filed against 145 persons and a total of 300 witnesses were interviewed to file the report, which runs into 3,000 pages."" The main charges levelled include murder, attempt to murder and destruction of property. The finding of the SIT is contrary to what the company had stated at the time of declaring lockout at the plant that the ""orchestrated"" violence appeared to be instigated from outside as ""there were no pending issues with the workers"".MSI chairman R C Bhargava had said the violence was a handiwork of ""extreme Left wing elements"" and ""it was a conspiracy which was kept within a small group of people"" and even described the incident as a ""class attack"".The Haryana government had formed an SIT under Assistant Commissioner of Police Ravinder Tomar with six inspectors to probe the incident.A total of over 140 workers, including leaders of Maruti Suzuki Workers Union, were arrested by the police. On July 18, violence broke out at the plant following an alleged scuffle between a worker and a supervisor. MSI general manager(HR) Awanish Kumar Dev was killed in the incident and 100 others were injured.The company declared a lockout at the plant on July 21and was lifted on August 21. During the lockout the overall production loss was pegged at around Rs 1,400 crore. Following the incident, MSI had also decided to terminate services of 500 permanent workers, who were allegedly found tobe involved in violence inside the plant."

That is very much part of our budget plan in April 2012,” said, SY Siddiqui, Managing Executive Officer (Administration), Maruti Suzuki.

Lockout in the Manesar unit of Maruti Suzuki is costing the company over Rs 90 crore per day, industry body Assocham today claimed. It also said the lockout is affecting over 650 units and has threatened closure of many ancillaries in the 60 km Gurgaon-Manesar-Dharuhera belt employing nearly one million workers. About 270 auto component vendors, too, are facing losses, it said.

However, according to Maruti Suzuki, the plant rolls out about 1,600 units per day and in terms of value, the daily loss to the company is about Rs 70 crore (excluding excise). ""...There are very significant direct employment and production losses arising out of the lockout,"" Assocham secretary general D S Rawat said, adding a prolonged shut down would drive component supplier from that region to go out of business permanently.Particularly, the SME sector units would face the severe threat of closing down and go out of business, he said. As orders have been down drastically, firms are curtailing output as Maruti is the biggest customer for all component makers of the Gurgaon-Manesar industrial belt,"" it said, adding Maruti consumes about one-third of the total production of Rs 20,000 crore by the Indian auto component manufacturers.Apart from component suppliers, it said, transporters, manpower suppliers and logistics companies are also getting affected. The company had declared a lockout at its Manesar plant after the July 18 violence in which a senior executive was killed and several others were injured.Commenting about investment climate in Haryana, it said that about 3.3% of total investments announced by both public and private sectors in India as on June have gone into the state. The state has attracted Rs 457,490 crore investments out of a total of Rs 13,959,539 crore announced in India, it said."

Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda today said he expected Maruti 's Manesar plant to resume production shortly. ""Production will begin soon and we are trying to do it as early as possible,"" Hooda said today at an interactive session with MCC Chamber of Commerce & Industry.

He, however, could not give a time-line by which the production at the Maruti facility would resume. Maruti Suzuki on July 21 had announced a lockout at its plant at Maneswar after a senior official of Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) was killed and 100 others were injured in the violence and arson that erupted on July 18.

Hooda said the Maruti management was happy with the steps taken by the government, including the formation of a special investigating team. ""Maruti had already said it was not going away from Haryana,"" Hooda said. Hooda claimed the overall crime rate and man days loss in Haryana was the lowest among states and described the Maruti episode as a 'stray' case.

As police arrests connected to the July 18 Maruti violence in Manesar is increasing, Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) seems to be crying foul. CITU claims that there are loopholes in FIR registered against 55 workers, reports CNBC-TV18 quoting sources. The trade unions have also roped in lawyers to fight cases of arrested Maruti workers.

According to sources, CITU feels that FIR failed to highlight cause of fire as it could have been due to short circuit. The trade unions also say that majority of the workers arrested are innocent.So far, police have arrested a total of 114 in the Maruti violence case.Meanwhile, CITU officials are likely to protest lock-out of Manesar plant as nearly 30,000 workers may lose job as a fall out. CITU is also planning to lead delegation to meet Haryana CM and may lead mass rally to protest the lock-out."

In the absence of domestic or global cues, Indian equity benchmarks chose to follow a tight range throughout the week. But, Friday brought along some cheer as the market received the much needed fillip from global cues. As the European Central Bank assured to pull out all stops to ensure that the euro survives, markets got a new lease of life with hopes of another big stimulus coming their way.Although, the Sensex had shot up 300 points at mid-day with the Nifty gaining 100 odd points, the sheen was lost as the day progressed. The BSE Sensex fell more than 300 points over last week to close at 16,839.19, after touching an intraday high of 16,975.03. The Nifty ended the trading session at 5,099.85 against last week's closing of 5205.10.As the earnings season progresses, heavyweights from the banking FMCG, auto and power sectors came out with their numbers but, it was not enough to pull the market out of its slumber. Besides, the much awaited presidential polls too are over and the government is yet to announce reforms. Hence, as the mood remains somber, the RBI's policy move in its next review on July 31 will be closely watched.First quarter results of heavyweights like FMCG major Hindustan Unilever, engineering and construction major Larsen and Toubro surpassed expectations as they managed to post a robust performance in the quarter ended June. While others like IT major Wipro reported growth, but muted second quarter guidance disappointed the market.Companies like Idea Cellular, Cairn India and Dabur too reported decent growth. State owned power equipment manufacturer BHEL beat estimates, posting a 13% increase in net profits. Cigarette major ITC too met expectations reporting a rise in profit margins. However, companies like JSW Energy and JSPL's performance dropped in the first quarter. Bharat Electrical also reported a strong top-line growth in Q1FY13.From the banking space, Yes Bank, ICICI Bank and PNB pleasantly surprised with a good set of numbers. Though, Union Bank's net was up, it disappointed with its performance due to rise in NPAs. India's largest power generation company NTPC posted better than expected results in Q1.Petrol and diesel prices rose in seven Indian states including West Bengal and Maharashtra. As state owned oil firms recalibrated rates to reflect changes in local levies, prices were raised in some states while 11 states like Goa, Karnataka, Gujarat and Orissa benefited from a reduction in oil prices. LPG prices too dropped in the states of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Odisha among others.Last week's violence at Maruti's Manesar plant led to a lockout which has now extended for more than a week fueling concerns of a supply strain.

Support is pouring in for the Maruti management with employees and heads of Honda Motors and two other companies planning a protest on Wednesday to condemn last week's violence at Maruti Suzuki's Manesar plant. Maruti has claimed that the unrest was not a labour issue but a criminal act.

The Haryana government has already begun a probe into the matter but the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) on Tuesday demanded an inquiry by an independent agency into the violence in which one executive was killed last week.Expressing 'shock and concern' at the incident, the CITU said it must be ""inquired into by an independent agency instead of making a shortcut projecting it as a violence and arson by workers..."".In a statement, CITU general secretary Tapan Sen said ""mass-scale indiscriminate arrests and detention of workers, rampaging the worker's colonies"" were still continuing.""CITU demands upon the government to stop such witch hunt and terror on workers and institute an independent inquiry into the incident including the antecedents to bring the truth to light and punish the guilty,"" Sen said.The union said in last year's strike at Maruti ""there had not been a single incident of violence from the worker's side, neither any report of damage despite many provocations..."".During the violence on July 18, a senior company executive was burnt alive and 100 others were injured. Maruti Suzuki has declared a lockout at the Manesar plant. Prohibitory orders were also clamped around the plant on Tuesday."

At 11:47 hours IST: Nifty, Sensex in tight range; L&T, TCS, BHEL under pressure

The BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty continued to move in a narrow range since early trade due to lack of global and local cues. The market seems to have priced in Spain woes and lack of support to foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail. It is eagarly waiting for the Reserve Bank of India's move on July 31 and some more June quarter earnings.

Fast moving consumer goods major HUL remained top gainer among largecaps, rising 5.5% after its profit after tax doubled to Rs 1331 crore helped by property sale during the quarter ended June 2012. Cigarette major ITC was up 0.8%.

Wipro, country's third largest software services exporter tanked 3% after the company has guided for a flattish growth in the second quarter. It met street expectations on Tuesday, with a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,580.2 crore in April-June, up 18% year-on-year.

Top software services exporter TCS and commercial vehicle maker Tata Motors were down 0.6% each.

At 10:22 hours IST: Sensex, Nifty choppy; HUL gains 4%, Wipro down 3%

Indian equity benchmarks were completely lacklustre in trade today following mixed Asian cues. FMCG major HUL topped the buying list, rising nearly 4% after stronger than expected numbers in June quarter while third largest software services exporter Wipro fell over 3% as the company could not report stellar performance in the first quarter of FY13.

The BSE benchmark was up 32 points at 16,909.24 and the NSE benchmark gained 8 points at 5,126.20. The broader markets too were choppy in trade.

Siddharth Bhamre of Angel Broking believes that the global factors would decide the future course of the market. ""We will be more on the mercy of global cues rather than internals of markets because internal market statistics are not working accordingly,"" he said.

Though the direction of market is not very clear at this point of time, his outlook is not very bearish. He expects to see some bounce back in the Nifty till the July series expires.

Cigarette major ITC, private sector lender ICICI Bank and software services exporter Infosys gained over 0.5%.

Top car maker Maruti Suzuki gained 1.5% as traders covered their short positions. The stock fell more than 11% since last Thursday due to stoppage of work at its Manesar plant.

The violent labour unrest at Maruti 's Manesar plant has now hit production. The company is now saying that the production of its new 800cc small car has been delayed.

The new model, pegged to be Alto's replacement was due to start this month. Maruti had planned a Diwali launch for the car.

The Manesar plant had remained shut for the fourth day on Friday even as the management said it could move part of its diesel car manufacturing operations out of Manesar. But the Haryana government is still maintaining that production could resume next week.

Over 1,000 policemen have now been deployed at the factory and work has been suspended indefinitely.

One person died of burn injuries and sources say 85 others were injured in a scuffle at Maruti's Manesar plant on Wednesday. A case has also been registered against 50 workers for attempt to murder and damage to property.

The workers allegedly set property on fire and ransacked the premises. Sources say that a supervisor allegedly got into an altercation with a junior worker and passed some disparaging and casteist remarks. During that altercation the worker allegedly slapped the supervisor, following which the management took the decision to suspend the worker. The other workers protested against the suspension.

While the management was meeting in the conference room, the workers stormed in and there was a physical fight. At the same time sections of workers set fire at five places in the factory including the control room and assembly line.

Work at the Manesar plant had to be stopped following the violence. The Gurgaon plant continued normally.

While reports say the scuffle was because of differences over wages, the company said, ""The sequence of events began in the morning with a worker beating up a supervisor on the shop floor. The workers' union prevented the management from taking disciplinary action against the worker. They blocked the exit gates and held the executives hostage. To resolve the issue amicably, members of the senior management met the union. During the talks, the workers attacked the senior management.""

On the other hand the Workers' Union hit back at the managament. In a statement, the Workers' union said, ""The Maruti Suzuki Workers Union (MSWU) is anguished at the recent developments in Maruti Suzuki plant, IMT Manesar where the management has resorted to anti-worker and anti-Union activities in a pre-planned manner leading to the closure of the factory yesterday.""

The body of the dead will be identified only after DNA tests are done. The Commissioner of Police told CNN-IBN that two shifts of workers are involved in the agitation.

Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has also promised stern action against the culprits.

Meanwhile, the shares of Maruti Suzuki India tumbled more than eight per cent in morning trade on Thursday on the bourses after production at its Manesar plant got affected following the scuffle.

""It was a pre-planned attack, we weren't able to understand it at that time. After a meeting ended, they started beating us, vandalising the office, machines and even some cars,"" an injured Maruti Suzuki employee said.

Labour unrest is not a new phenomenon in Manesar plant which mainly produces Swift. The factory had witnessed three such instances last year causing a total production loss of about 83,000 units.

In reply to a question on skill development, he said the government of India under PPP mode has set up National Skill Development Council which would be a game changer in coming years.

""The NSDC is headed by a former CII official and would play a key role in enhancing employability skills of youths of the country by 2020.

Here is how Maruti shares fared during the labour unrest that began on June 4 last year, and which continued in phases before it was finally resolved on October 20. The stock shed around 13% and the company suffered an output loss of over 1 lakh vehicles. It is not clear how long the latest bout of worker problem will last. But it comes at a time when sentiment for the sector as a whole is weak because of falling demand. So far this calendar, Maruti shares have risen 21% compared to a 13% rise in the BSE Auto index."

Also read:

Nirmal Jain says it is good time to buy; bets on 3 sectors

Anisha Rudra: What is your year-end target for the Nifty?

Kaji: I believe the market has bottomed out in terms of valuations on price basis as well as time basis. So, inspite of challenging environment domestically as well as globally, the market will move up, but slowly. I expect the Nifty to be in the range of 5,600-5,800 by year-end.

Tina Basetia: Can you recommend the best stock picks?

Kaji: I believe it depends on your risk appetite and time horizon. If you are decent risk taker with one-two year time horizon then

L&T

,

SBI

,

IDFC

,

Maruti

look good to go long on for over 50% returns. If you are conservative then

Cipla

,

Hindustan Unilever

can deliver 20-30% returns in one-year time frame.

Gaurav Nyati: What is your call on a stock like

Kingfisher

?

Kaji: Kingfisher is for those investors who believe in betting on philosophy that if promoter group is strong and politically well connected then they can turnaround a company, even if it is sick. It does play out historically in cases like Jindals, and Adanis. But risks are very high. Unless aviation policy does not become favorable, the stock will find it difficult to go beyond 17-18.

Pallavi Sharma: What is your view on the cement sector, especially stocks like

Ambuja Cements

after the CCI penalty? Should one hold or sell?

Kaji: As the negative is out, the hangover is over. The market will factor the impact in prices. In the short-term, the ability to raise prices will definitely decline. But I believe most of them will go for appeal. So, for the short-term, one should avoid. If one is holding Ambuja Cements, he/she should hold on as Rs 190 can be achieved in the next six months.

Anurag Srivastava: Can

Bank of India

be held for a period of five years? What is your outlook?

Kaji: Bank of India is a good bet for three-five years as capital adequacy is good for it to capture growth without diluting in big way. One can look at CAGR returns of 15-18% over next five years.

Gautam Dudhoria: Is

Delta Corp

a long-term bet?

Kaji: Delta Corp is a long-term bet considering the sector prospects in which the company operates. But returns will mainly depend on company’s ability to capitalise on the potential of the sector. I would say it’s a concept stock. If you believe in the potential of sector, you hold for long term

Hitesh Rajpara: What is your call on

United Phosphorus

,

Orchid Chemicals

and

Biocon

?

Kaji: United Phosphorus is attractively valued at current prices. With fertiliser sector likely to be focus on policy front, positive can be expected from that angle too.

Orchid, I would avoid considering the corporate governance issues as well as high pledge of promoter holding increasing risk of margin sell-off, which had happened in past.

Biocon can be accumulated at current levels for a quarter slowly as it will take one more quarter to resolve fundamental issues. But I don’t see near-term upside.

Umesh Nangia: Open interest in

Infosys

is increasing. Should I hold it for some more time?

Kaji: Infosys is likely to consolidate gains of last couple of weeks in range of Rs 2,400-2,500. Next quarter numbers are likely to be subdued. But that is, more or less, factored in. Upside is limited in the near-term

Siddhartha Umesh Shah: What is your view on

Fortis

,

BEML

and

BEL

from a four-five year time horizon?

Kaji: In the long-term, all three are good. Among the three, BEL can give better returns followed by BEML and Fortis.

Vineet Kalra: What is your call on

3i Infotech

?

Kaji: It’s very difficult for company to grow, considering the leverage. It is more likely to be taken over by someone. If your risk appetite is high, with this thing in mind, one will make decent returns. If that happens otherwise, stock will languish around current levels.

Radhika Vishwanathan: I hold 150 shares of

ICICI Bank

at Rs 830. What is the future for banks in the near-term? Do I accumulate more?"

Ventura has come out with its report on auto sector. The research firm expects the auto sales in the near term to remain subdued.

Petrol price hike and slowdown in the economy accompanied with high interest rates further dampened the sentiments of the consumers. Though, the petrol car sales dropped significantly, car players with a diesel portfolio sustained the growth momentum partially benefitting from the hike in petrol prices. Two wheeler sales also remained sluggish with only the domestic market leader and unlisted players with a small base recording growth. Maruti ’s volumes fell by 5% yoy as the sales of its petrol offerings dropped by 29% yoy. M&M’s volumes (excluding tractors) were higher by 28.2% yoy supported by its core diesel portfolio. Tractor volumes remained flat and posted a marginal growth of 0.7% yoy reflecting the slowdown in the farm equipment sector. Within the two wheeler segment, Hero MotoCorp posted a growth of 11.3% yoy whereas sales of Bajaj Auto and TVS Motors dipped by 1.8% yoy and 5.3% yoy respectively.Neutral Despite the petrol price cut of Rs. 2/litre we expect the sales in the near term to remain subdued. Volumes growth will be largely contributed by the diesel portfolio of the major OEM’s. Two wheeler sales are also expected to remain in the lower growth trajectory; however a slight momentum may be witnessed with many new launches due in the current fiscal.The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Car sales in Japan jumped in February as government efforts to revive domestic sales and replenished inventories drew buyers into showrooms in the world's third-largest car market.

, posted steady growth in sales for February, the penultimate month in an otherwise disappointing fiscal year.

Maruti, 54.2% owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp, said it sold 118,949 vehicles in February, an increase of 6.5% from the year-ago period.

The company, which suffered significant production losses in 2011 due a strike, last month reported its first monthly sales rise since May 2011.

Shares in Maruti, valued at about USD 7.5 billion, jumped as much as 5% to Rs 1,317.60 in a weak Mumbai market.Tata Motors , which makes the Nano, the world's cheapest car, also posted a 19% jump in February sales.

Tata Motors also owns the luxury Jaguar and Land Rover brands, but their sales are not included in the company's monthly figures.Mahindra & Mahindra , India's largest maker of utility vehicles and tractors, said total vehicle sales for February jumped 29% to 43,087, while exports surged 86%.

Annual car sales in India are expected to drop in the year ending in March for the first time since 2002, as high financing and running costs deterred buyers in one of the fastest growing markets in the world.

New automobile sales in Japan surged 29.5% year-on-year to 519,626 vehicles in February, industry data showed on Thursday. Excluding 660cc minivehicles, sales jumped 31.9% to 333,213 vehicles, the sixth consecutive month of annual gains.Japanese automakers are expecting a standout home market in 2012 following the extension of tax incentives for fuel-efficient cars and the return of subsidies to encourage replacement of older cars with new, cleaner vehicles.""Customer understanding (of a recovery in supply and government incentives) is rising, so we have similar expectations for March,"" said Michiro Saito, an official at the Japan Automobile Dealers Association.In 2011, Japan's massive earthquake and tsunami then flooding in Thailand, a major manufacturing base, caused autoparts shortages and production suspensions, cutting inventories and sales.Japanese auto demand is expected to rise 19 percent in 2012, partly due to higher sales in tsunami-hit areas, where thousands of cars were destroyed, and thanks to government efforts to stimulate demand.The incentives especially favour hybrids, pure electric cars and other vehicles that employ advanced technology such as clean diesel engines. That particularly benefits Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co.Sales at top-ranked Toyota, excluding its Lexus brand, soared 38.2% last month, while those of Honda jumped 46.7%.Meanwhile Indian carmakers, led by top player Maruti Suzuki"

Short Hero Motocorp between Rs 1900-1960, says Anil Manghnani, Modern Shares & Stock Brokers.

Manghnani told CNBC-TV18, ""Bank Nifty already achieved 9100-9200 yesterday, which is the major significant target, given that it is rallying from 7700-7800. So I think the banking names first; I have already mentioned ICICI Bank on Wednesday. You can probably look at Axis Bank HDFC Bank , they have all run their course, and even IndusInd Bank has run its course. So many of these are at major technical resistant levels where I think you can look to short.""He further added, ""The other one, I am going out and saying my call for the whole year on auto sector is very clear. Every fall you look to add Maruti and Tata Motors but vice-versa you would look to short Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M), Bajaj Auto and Hero Motocorp. Hero has rallied all the way from Rs 1700 to 1900 plus that is a short now between Rs 1900 and 1960 and even M&M has rallied from Rs 630 so Rs 700-720 range is a sell for me."""

With a flashy new model of its best-selling Swift hitting showrooms and India's traditional festive car sales boom just around the corner, September was supposed to be a month to cheer for Maruti Suzuki, the country's biggest carmaker.

It didn't work out that way.Labour unrest that began on Aug. 29 has crippled production, sending sales tumbling and allowing rivals to eat into its market share in an industry fighting for customers as high costs and interest rates bite.Maruti's share of India's passenger vehicle market stood at 40% last month, sliding eight percentage points since labor unrest began in June.A failure to end the unrest, despite talks brokered by the state government of Haryana, where both plants are located, comes as Maruti feels the heat of rising interest rates and input costs that have hurt demand in the world's second-fastest growing major auto market after China.Maruti's flagship Swift hatchback, which was revamped in mid-August amid a flurry of publicity, has about 100,000 customers still waiting for their car to arrive.The two Maruti plants, which typically make 600 Swifts a day, assembled 300 of those models on Wednesday, resuming production on Tuesday after a complete shutdown of a week.Even if the carmaker is able to ramp up production to twice that figure on a daily basis, clearing the backlog of orders could take around six months.""There is no way market share can be secured when we don't have the cars to sell,"" a company spokesman told Reuters. ""Right now, all our efforts are to maximise production and get close to normal levels.""Maruti, which produced every second new passenger vehicle sold in India last September, accounted for only 40% of sales last month, according to data from the company and industry body Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.""Competitors have ramped up production and increased capacity, and that's really dented Maruti's market share,"" said Yaresh Kothari, autos analyst with Angel Broking in Mumbai.""It's particularly damaging that they have not been able to increase production during the festive season, which is when they need the extra cars the most.""Carmakers typically see a sales boost in October during the annual festive season, when Indians receive bonuses and big-ticket purchases are considered auspicious.LONG-RUNNING DISPUTEMaruti, 54.2% owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp, has suffered a total production loss of over 64,000 cars in 2011 due to strikes by its employees, a shortfall equivalent to around USD 400 million.Industrial action first flared up in June when a 13-day strike by workers demanding the firm recognise a new union lead to a production loss of USD 95 million.Maruti has lost 12%age points in the last 12 months. That looks set to skid further as the unrest rumbles on.Meanwhile, rivals are benefiting. South Korea's Hyundai Motors, India's second-largest passenger carmaker by sales, saw its market share jump almost 3%age points in September to 21.7%.Tata Motors' market share stood at 16.4% in September from 15% a year ago, while fellow competitor Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd's share rose to 11.7% from 10.4%.Suzuki has also had to deal with a halt in production at its motorcycle factory in Thailand since Oct. 12 due to floods in the country.Still, analysts suggested that Maruti could claw back some of its market share if it can end the labour dispute.""Cancellations from Swift customers haven't been that large, people are prepared to wait. That is a big positive for Maruti moving forward,"" said Vineet Hetamasaria, analyst at Mumbai-based PINC research.""When things calm down again, we're expecting Maruti to rebound back to a market share in the high 40s.""Maruti shares have fallen almost 25% since January, underperforming a near 18-percent fall in the broader market."

Talks continue as Maruti Manesar plant strike enters 14th day Marathon talks brokered by the Haryana government between the management and striking workers at Maruti Suzuki India's (MSI) Manesar plant are still on,with the stir entering its 14th day today.According to the company, the talks that began yesterday morning at 11 am continued through the night and were still going on this morning.""The tripartite negotiation is still going on since 11 am yesterday,"" a Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) spokesperson told PTI. Talks between the MSI management and workers in the presence of Haryana Labour Department officials resumed yesterday morning after they broke down on October 18.

""Hopes of an agreement were raised late last night, but an agreement could not be reached as both sides stuck to their stands,"" a source privy to the talks said. Meanwhile, shares of the company were being quoted 0.04 per cent lower at Rs 1,065.10 apiece at 0925 hours on theBombay Stock Exchange (BSE).In the meantime, the company said it will continue partial production at its Manesar plant with a limited workforce. The company has already resumed operations at the plant with workers who did not join the strike. It claimed that the strength at the plant has gone up to 600 and rolled out 200 cars yesterday.MSI Chairman R C Bhargava yesterday said the company was hopeful the impasse would end in the next 4-5 days. ""We have been talking to them for the last three days. We keep talking as a solution to these things takes some time. I cannot say when, but only I can hope that the issues will be solved in the next 4-5 days,"" he said."

The labour agitation at the Maruti plant in Manesar has intensified in its day 8 on Friday as workers have defied the Punjab and Haryana High Court order by protesting within 100 metres of the plant.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court had asked the workers to keep their protest 100 metres away from the plant.

Police sources say workers who have been protesting inside will have to vacate the premises. The police are trying to cripple the agitation by preventing the supply of food and water to protesters.

The Employees union is adamant and said that the strike will continue even if police resort to action.

Trade unions also joined the protests on Thursday and the dharna will continue till October 17. Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki has decided to suspend production at its Gurgaon plant for the next 48 hours.

Chairman RC Bhargava has refused to cede to the demands, warning more workers will be dismissed."

Twenty four hours after its parliament voted down a bill to expand guarantees, Europe's bailout fund, the EFSF, Slovakia's top political parties came to an agreement saying they would approve measures by the end of the week. The reason for the breakthrough was the promise of early elections.

Meanwhile, Greece's budget deficit widened 15% in the first nine months of the year. That is narrower than Athens' recently revised forecast. Nonetheless, Germany's finance minister has called for greater measures to reduce Greece's debt, including bigger participation by private investors.Responding to the cues, the Wall Street logged gains, but ended off-highs following a report that European banks may shrink to meet higher reserve targets. European markets finished higher as Slovakia reaches a deal to strengthen the euro zone rescue fund.There is news that US Securities and Exchange Commission is now seeking comment on implementing the so-called Volcker rule that would restrict banks from trading on their own account and also from investing in hedge funds.

The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers today condemned the alleged violence inside Maruti's Manesar plant, but said workers have a ""right of collective bargain"".

""Law-and-order situation arising out of the current situation (inside Maruti Suzuki's Manesar plant) is highly condemnable. Nobody can support any form of violence,"" the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) President S Sandilya told reporters here.SIAM ""hopes"" that the government will immediately intervene to bring the situation under control and will take action against the guilty, he added.Talking about the agreement that was mediated by the Haryana government and signed between the Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) management and worker representatives, Sandilya said both parties should respect it.""Commitments given by unions and associations, and then not abiding by them disturbs us a lot. In MSI's case, workers signed a pact that was brokered by the government and then broke it within three days. This is not a healthy sign. SIAM strongly protests violation of agreement,"" he added.Sandilya, however, said workers also have their basic rights and nobody should ""go beyond"" the law.""Workers have a right of collective bargain, but the management also have the right to implement the laws of the land... Rights come with responsibility,"" he added.Workers at MSI's Manesar plant went on stay-in strike on Friday afternoon completely affecting production at the plant.The number of workers, who went on strike, was around 2,000, including regular, contractual, apprentices and trainees.The number, however, came down to about 1,500 after the company ""rescued"" some workers, who were ""held under duress"".The company alleged that the striking workers attacked co-workers, supervisors and executives in multiple incidents of violence and damaged factory properties inside the plant.The workers, however, denied any such acts and said they were ""manhandled by company bouncers"". They have gone on strike demanding reinstatement of casual workers and 44 permanent employees, who were suspended during the 33-day-long standoff that ended on October 1 after signing an agreement.As per the agreement, the company had agreed to conditionally take back 18 trainees who were suspended.The workers in turn had agreed to sign the 'good conduct bond', which said that they would ""not resort to go slow, intermittent stoppage of work, stay-in-strike, work-to-rule, sabotage or otherwise indulge in any activity, which would hamper the normal production in the factory"".In June also, MSI had witnessed a 13-day-long strike at the Manesar plant by the workers demanding recognition of a new labour body -- Maruti Suzuki Employees Union (MSEU). The stir had resulted in a production loss of 12,600 cars, which were valued at about Rs 630 crore."

""The market has already slowed down. This latest hike will further dampen the auto sector. It will dampen demand during the festive season. It was never expected. The RBI should have given a break, at least this time,"" General Motors India Vice-President P Balendran told PTI.The Reserve Bank raised its key rates by 25 bps points to 8.25% - the 12th hike since last March, in its bid to batten down inflation which stood at an elevated 9.78% in August.""Usually, every year we target around 20% jump in sales during the festive season, but this year we expected only 5% spike due to repeated interest rate hikes.

The Haryana Labour department today said the agitating workers of Maruti's Manesar plant were adamant on not rejoining their duties, despite its best efforts to resolve the issue.

Asking workers to sign the good conduct bond as there is nothing illegal in it, the department said the ""problems of workers could aggravate"" if they continue to abstain from their work.""They (workers) are not ready to listen to us. I along with Labour Commissioner met them (last week) and appealed to them to rejoin their duties as we do not see any illegality in the good conduct bond (which the company is asking workers to sign it,"" Haryana Labour Secretary Sarban Singh told PTI today.Asked whether any body or organisation was instigating workers to continue shun work, Singh refused to be drawn into this matter.However, he said, ""We have not seen any evidence of workers being instigated by any body. But if they are getting instigated then it is their fault.""Maruti Suzuki India Chairman RC Bhargava few days back had termed the labour unrest as ""political issue"".However, the entire state machinery is on its job to resolve the issue at the earliest so that the production at Maruti Suzuki plant could turn normal.Labour Secretary said the Maruti management was making its own arrangements by hiring more people to avoid further production losses.""Management has already started recruiting new people (to run factory) ... problems of workers (if they continue to be on strike) could further aggravate..so they should accept what management says,"" he said.On the charge being leveled by workers that the labour department takes side of the management, Singh said, ""it is not true. We are talking to them (workers) ... we have even personally met them and our officers are still on their job to resolve the issue.""Trouble arose in Maruti Suzuki's plant at Manesar last month when management asked workers to sign good conduct bond before entering factory."

Emkay Global Financial Services has come out with its report on automobile sector. The research firm downgrade Bajaj Auto from buy to accumulate.

We have been overweight on the automobile sector post 3QFY11 with ~88% of the stocks having a positive view as compared to only ~43% in the preceding quarter. This was despite the near term concerns like higher interest rate/inflation, base effect, etc. Our view was primarily based on (1) Valuations (especially relative valuations), which were trading at a significant discount due to excessive focus on near term concerns (2) Strong cash flow generation and high ROIC business (3) Our FY11-FY13E estimates factoring in the slowdown impact.Our automobile universe has since then outperformed the broader market indices significantly with some stocks even posting absolute returns. Despite the strong relative outperformance, we still find the current valuations reasonable as our analysis reveals adequate near term positives as well as long term triggers. The near term positives emerge from (1) High base effect of inflation/interest rate (2) Favorable base effect for IIP (3) Good monsoon and (4) Easing of raw material cost pressures.Similarly, our long term analysis reveals ample growth potential across segments, which are enumerated below.."

New vehicle sales in Japan plunged by more than a fifth in August as production remained disrupted from the March earthquake, while South Korean brands kept growing thanks to solid gains overseas.

Excluding 660cc minivehicles, sales in Japan dropped 25.5% to 216,510 vehicles, marking the 12th consecutive month of declines and the second-biggest fall on record for August, the Japan Automobile Dealers Association said on Thursday.The sharp decline came from difficult comparisons from a year earlier, when consumers rushed to replace old cars and take advantage of government subsidies before they expired last September. Compared with August sales from 2009, sales grew 9.5%, an official said.""It was the first time since the (March 11) disasters that sales grew from 2009 levels, so there's a silver lining,"" said Michiro Saito, general manager at the association. ""Automakers are planning to ramp up production from now on to make up for the losses, so we'll see how that helps.""Sales at top-ranked Toyota Motor Corp, which started make-up production on Thursday, fell 22.7%. Nissan Motor Co's sales, excluding minivehicles, dropped 24.7%.Honda Motor Co, the slowest to recover from the supply disruptions, suffered the biggest decline, of 49%.In India, top carmaker Maruti Suzuki posted its third consecutive drop in monthly sales as high interest rates and rising vehicle prices deterred customers. Maruti's sales fell 12.7% in August after a record 25% drop in July.An ongoing labour dispute at its Manesar plant also hit sales for the month, Maruti said in a statement.Earlier this week, Maruti halted production at its plant in the northern Haryana state after it dismissed some workers and asked all others to sign a ""good conduct bond."" The plant, which produces about 1,200 cars a day, did not make any cars on Monday and Tuesday and made just 60 cars on Wednesday.Maruti, 54.2% owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp, expects to post single-digit sales growth this fiscal year, a far cry from the 25% rise last year.Total car sales in India fell almost 16% in July, marking the first drop in two-and-half years, as borrowing costs rose following multiple rate hikes by the central bank.

Hyundai, Kia stretch winning streak

South Korea's Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors stretched their current winning streak with Hyundai's global sales climbing 5%, driven by strong shipments from its overseas plants in China, India and the United States.Affiliate Kia saw its global sales jump 27%, although domestic sales slipped.Analysts said however, the Koreans may struggle to maintain the momentum in the face of an uncertain global economy and rising price competition from Japanese rivals.Toyota last week unveiled its all-new Camry in the United States, aiming to recover lost momentum with price cuts and a high-powered ad campaign for America's best-selling car.""The market expected solid sales for Hyundai and Kia for August. What's important are their sales in the coming months,"" said Park In-woo, an analyst at LIG Investment & Securities.""Hyundai and Kia have comfortably increased market shares and profits, but competition will be tougher next year with new model launches (by Japanese rivals),"" he said.Analysts are watching for US sales data due later on Thursday to gauge their resistance to rising competition."

Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp forecast a 2.9% rise in annual operating profit on Thursday even as the March 11 earthquake forced a limited start to production and demand slows in its key Indian market.

Japan's fourth-largest automaker sees an operating profit of 110 billion yen (USD 1.37 billion) for the business year ending in March 2012, easily beating the average forecast of 90.4 billion yen in a survey of 20 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The maker of the Swift and other compact cars sees net profit of 50 billion yen, up 10.7% from 2010/11.Suzuki's shares jumped on the news, trading up 3.6% at 1,765 yen in morning trade, while Tokyo's transport sector subindex was 1% higher.Suzuki last month posted a 51% drop in fourth-quarter operating profit to 14.48 billion yen (USD 180 million), citing a hit from the supply chain disruption after the magnitude-9.0 earthquake.Suzuki's majority-owned Indian unit, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd , last week ended a 13-day strike by employees that had crippled production and led to more than USD 90 million in lost output. About 800 workers had been on strike at the top Indian automaker's Manesar plant, demanding recognition of a new union specific to the plant. The company has one workers' union recognised by management.A Maruti spokesman has said it would not recognise a new union but would look into forming an individual entity at the plant.

The country's largest car-maker Maruti Suzuki India said production at its Manesar plant continues to be completely affected as the ongoing workers strike entered its twelfth day.

""The situation is the same as yesterday. There is no production going on,"" a company spokesperson told PTI. The company saw production hit by 10,200 units till yesterday, which translates into a loss of about Rs 510 crore.

On Wednesday morning, shares of

Maruti Suzuki India

(MSI) were trading 0.43% down at Rs 1,217.50 apiece on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

Yesterday evening, Haryana Labour Department officials held several rounds of separate meetings with the company management and the striking workers. However, a scheduled joint discussion comprising all parties during the late evening did not take place.

""We had a meeting with the Gurgaon Deputy Labour Commissioner in the evening. The Labour Commissioner was supposed to come along with the management, but they held their meeting at a different place. The joint meeting did not happen,"" the newly formed Maruti Suzuki Employees Union's (MSEU) General Secretary Shiv Kumar said.

No immediate comment could be obtained from the company on this issue. Meanwhile, the All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), which is leading the agitation from outside along with other unions such as the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said the five-member joint committee formed in support of Maruti's striking workers will meet in the afternoon today to decide on its future course of action.

Workers in the Gurgaon-Manesar industrial belt had planned a two-hour tool-down strike yesterday morning in support of Maruti's workers at the Manesar plant. However, after beginning the tool-down strike at some factories, workers postponed the symbolic stir by a day following an appeal from Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda.

""Keeping in view the current situation, we have decided not to hold the tool-down strike today. We will meet at 4 pm and will decide about the future actions then,"" AITUC Secretary D L Sachdev said.

On June 4, workers went on strike demanding the recognition of a new union, the Maruti Suzuki Employees Union, formed by those working at the Manesar plant, among other things.

While a company spokesperson said only about 600 people are on strike, MSEU's Kumar claimed at least 2,000 workers are on the sit-in stir at the plant.

Cracking the whip, the company fired 11 workers last week for allegedly inciting others to go on strike. Currently the company has one recognised union -- Maruti Udyog Kamgar Union -- which is dominated by workers at the Gurgaon plant.

The Manesar plant rolls out about 1,200 units every day in two shifts. The factory produces hatchbacks Swift and A-Star and sedans DZiRE and SX4."

Shares of Maruti Suzuki India fell over 2% to Rs 1227.90 at 1009 IST on concerns that an appreciation in Japan's yen following Friday's devastating earthquake would hurt the car maker's margins this year.

Analysts expect the yen will continue to strengthen against major currencies as more yen is withdrawn for rebuilding projects in Japan.

A 1% strengthening of the yen impacts Maruti Suzuki's margins by 27 basis points, as it imports technology and equipment from Japan, apart from the royalty payments it makes to its Japanese parent, Citigroup said in a report to clients.

Maruti Suzuki, India's largest passenger car maker by sales, saw its earnings drop as much as 18% in the Oct-Dec quarter to Rs 565.2 crore, even though sales rose around 27%.

Higher royalty payments, apart from increased raw material costs were a major reason for the earnings drop in the third quarter.

Maruti's royalty payment to its parent Suzuki Motor Corp, has gone up to 5.2% of sales from 3.6% a year ago, as royalty payments grew sharply in rupee terms, following yen appreciation.

""Maruti has 2% sensitivity to 1% move in the yen,"" according to a CLSA report."
