Despite growing awareness and a trend towards healthier lifestyles, a vast majority of Indian consumers continue to buy packaged food products that are deemed unhealthy. So much so that this category accounts for a third of total packaged foods revenue.

According to a report by Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI), a global not-for-profit organisation backed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Gates Foundation among others, of 1,901 products currently being sold by top 20 food companies in India, only 24 percent qualify as ""healthier"" products. These firms collectively represent 36 percent of the overall sales in the processed packaged foods sector in India.

ATNI's index methodology assessed companies using 58 indicators across seven categories, providing a comprehensive evaluation. The categories include product profile, governance, accessibility, marketing, workforce nutrition, labelling and policy engagement. In terms of “healthiness” scores among Indian companies, ITC emerged as the leader, followed by Hindustan Unilever, Nestlé India, PepsiCo India and Coca-Cola India.

A 'healthy product' is one that scores 3.5 or more out of 5 on a 'health star rating' model that rewards higher levels of fruits, vegetables and fibre, and penalizes higher sodium, saturated fat, and sugar content.

However, the overall healthiness of companies' products presents a concerning picture. The mean healthiness score was found to be 1.9 stars out of 5.0, consistent with the 2020 figures. Notably, substantial variation exists among companies, with over half (55.6 percent) of all products scoring 1.5 out of 5 stars or below. The report also highlighted that 12 percent of products were eligible for marketing to children, based on the WHO South-East Region criteria.

To conduct this evaluation, the index used the internationally recognised Health Star Rating (HSR) nutrient profiling model, endorsed by various governments. Products scoring 3.5 stars or more out of 5 in the HSR can be confidently promoted as healthier choices in public settings, according to ATNI's findings.

“This India index will serve as a powerful catalyst for driving positive change within the food and beverage industry in India. By focusing on private sector contributions to diet, nutrition and health, the index sheds light on what is working and what is not among the food industry.” said Greg S Garrett, executive director, ATNI.

This insight comes from a deeper dive into the efforts of seven out of the 20 indexed companies currently undertaking transformative journeys, aligning (re)formulation targets with dietary guidelines for sodium, saturated fat, and sugar.

Hindustan Unilever, ITC and PepsiCo India distinguish themselves by establishing targets to decrease salt, sugar and saturated fat in their products. Additionally, Hindustan Unilever and ITC have set goals to boost beneficial ingredients like fruits, vegetables and whole grains in relevant product categories, the report added.

Despite these initiatives, the study brings attention to a notable challenge—the absence of a universally agreed-upon definition of what qualifies as healthy food. Companies, it seems, are left to rely on their own interpretations, which may not align with each other or with internationally-recognised standards. The intricacies of defining and measuring healthiness in food products add a layer of complexity to the industry's journey toward offering healthier options to consumers."

Tobacco major ITC, which sells cigarette brands Goldflake, Classic, and Bristol, is seeing a slowdown in revenue growth. Revenue growth for ITC’s cigarette segment has slumped from 29 percent in Q1FY23 to 8.5 percent in Q2FY24. Should this be a cause of worry for investors?

After ITC's July-to-September earnings, brokerages said that volume growth for ITC's cigarettes was lower than expected. Motilal Oswal had estimated a volume growth of six percent, but the actual growth was four percent in Q2FY24.

Analysts Moneycontrol spoke to said that ITC’s revenue growth from cigarettes has been moderating since Q1FY24, albeit on a higher base. The growth rate was higher in the last one year on account of factors like moderating taxation, growing out-of-home consumption, and weak competition from other listed cigarette peers, said analysts. A high base in the last financial year is causing a lower growth rate this financial year, although growth levels this year are comfortable, say analysts.

One of the reasons for high growth in the last fiscal is a moderation in taxes. Excise duty had increased at a CAGR of 16-18 percent over FY13-18 and it moderated with a 3-5 percent increase over FY19-23, said an analyst. “An increase in taxes on cigarettes over FY13-18 made cigarettes expensive, which in turn lowered volumes of listed players like ITC,” said a consumer analyst. The period of FY22 had seen a recovery in cigarette volumes. So, FY22 and FY23 was the period where cigarette consumption picked up and boosted revenues for ITC.

Excise revenue collection fell sharply as excise duty on cigarettes reduced in that period.

In the previous budget, the government increased the NCCD (National Calamity Contingent Duty) on cigarettes by 16 percent, but this did not have much of an impact, with cigarette prices increasing by a mere 7-12 paisa per stick. NCCD is levied as a percentage of excise on certain manufactured goods, including cigarettes.

Secondly, in FY23 illegal cigarette players and some other larger players were facing challenges that diluted competition in the market and benefited ITC, said Preeyam Toila, FMCG and retail analyst at Axis Securities.

After the pandemic, the sales of cigarettes saw a significant rise due to the increased out-of-home consumption, said Vishal Gutka of Phillip Capital. He mentioned that in FY23, people returning to offices contributed to the noticeable increase in cigarette sales during the same period.

Volume growth is estimated to be in mid-single digits over the next two quarters, while revenue is estimated to be in double digits, said an analyst.

Emkay Global Financial Services, in a report on the sector, estimates that cigarette volumes will grow 3-5 percent over FY24. “From the core cigarette business perspective, we expect rational tax hikes ahead, given a higher share of the ad-valorem component leading to a build-up of volumes, which, along with an improving mix, would aid high-single-digit EBIT growth,” said the brokerage firm.

Analysts say that even though the growth rate for the cigarette business is slowing, it does not pose a concern for ITC.

Post Q1FY24 earnings, brokerages have maintained add/buy ratings on the stock. HDFC Institutional Research has an 'Add' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 450 per share. Motilal Oswal has a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 535 per share.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC EBIDTA growth at 3% was below estimates due to sharp decline in Paperboard segment EBIT by ~50% and moderation in cigarette volume growth to 4.9% on a normalized and high base. FMCG EBIDTA margins of 11% (36.8% EBIT growth) and 49.6% EBIT growth in hotels have been positive. We expect cigarette volume growth to moderate to 4-5% range in 2H24. FMCG business is expected to gain from festive season, expected uptick in rural demand and scale economies. We believe Paper and Paperboard business is near bottom and expect QoQ margin improvement in coming quarters. We expect strong growth from Hotels and FMCG to sustain given benign input costs and strong demand outlook for both domestic and foreign travel. We are largely retaining our estimates and introduce FY26 EPS. we estimate 9.7% EPS CAGR over FY23-26. We believe FMCG and IT services will add significant shareholder value over coming few years. ITC trades at 23.6x Sept FY25 EPS with ROE/ROCE of 32.8/42.3% and ~80%+ dividend payout.

Outlook

We assign SOTP based target price of Rs492 (Rs475 earlier) as we roll forward to Sept25. Valuations limit major downside, expect for any punitive cigarette taxes in future. We expect back ended returns post sharp appreciation over past couple of years. Retain Accumulate.

Motilal Oswal's research report on ITC

ITC's 2QFY24 results were in line with our estimates. The cigarette business posted ~4% YoY volume growth in 2QFY24 vs. our estimate of +6%. With no material increase in the Cigarette GST/National Calamities Duty, the volume growth outlook remains healthy. However, the near-term margin would remain under pressure due to cost inflation. ITC has posted only 8.3% revenue growth in the Other FMCG business due to subdued demand. It also faces heightened competition from local and regional players like the other large FMCG companies, in the backdrop of commodity price deflation. The Agri business, excluding wheat and rice exports, delivered a healthy performance driven by value-added agri and leaf tobacco. The Paper segment was hit by demand issues, competition from China, lower pulp prices, and higher input costs. However, there were signs of revival towards the end of the quarter. The Hotels segment reported a robust performance despite the flat occupancy YoY due to renovations and relatively smaller number of wedding dates.

Outlook

We retain our BUY rating on ITC as we believe its earnings visibility remains better than that of peers. Our TP of INR535 is based on 28x FY25E EPS.

“I think that most individual investors make great mistakes when they try and time the market, and try and think about what's the best stock to buy now.” - Bill Miller

The second-quarter numbers have not thrown up any nasty surprises yet, particularly from the small and midcap segment. That partly explains why the second line shares continue to fare better than their large cap peers in a falling market. FIIs continue to sell more often than they are buying, but then, does it really matter? Devina Mehra had recently tweeted that FII activity and market performance have no direct co-relation.

Polycab

Good set of numbers, but a muted price response - that's Polycab in the second quarter. No wonder as the stock has almost doubled in value in less than seven months. The management tells CNBC TV-18 its volumes will outgrow the industry average. That could, to an extent, justify premium valuations, but how much is the question.

Like ICICI versus HDFC in the banking sector and TCS versus Infosys in the tech sector, it is Polycab versus Havells in the cables and wires sector.

Will prospective investors switch to Havells, which has had a relatively modest run this year of around 22 percent? That may not look enough in a market like this! The issue with Havells is that it is quoting an even higher valuation compared to Polycab. And its earnings trajectory over the last many quarters do not appear to inspire confidence. The Polycab management says it will hit its Rs 20,000-crore topline guidance before FY26. For the moment, it appears to be, advantage Polycab.

Voltas

The stock has dished out another disappointing quarterly performance with its margins continuing to be under pressure. A burst of bargain buying after

the first quarter numbers had sparked a 21 percent rally in the stock between mid-July and mid-September, taking it past Rs 900. Some of the analysts bullish on the stock have been arguing that an improvement in performance of Voltas’s other line of business should help ease the pressure on its core cooling business. But the second quarter numbers show that regaining the lost market share in the core business is turning out to be harder than what bulls were expecting.

ITC

A good set of quarterly numbers but signs of moderation in the core cigarette business. Paperboard and agri businesses were the laggards, analysts say.

ITC was seen a rerating play, and that appears to have played out. Unless the company can announce some more restructuring of the business. Even if the second quarter numbers were stronger, there would not have been a rush to buy the stock.

HUL

Key takeaways from post-earnings commentary by the management: Rural growth remains subdued, competitive intensity remains high, turnaround in rural markets will be gradual, volumes in food and refreshment hit by high prices, volume recovery to be gradual.

IT Services

Invesco’s Taher Badshah is seeing a pushback from clients of IT companies. Business execution and ramp-up recovery has slowed, and could take a quarter longer than what most analysts were expecting. Not much upside from these levels in the short term, says Badshah.

End of short selling?

A US court has ruled that broker-dealers may be primarily liable for manipulative trading initiated by their customers because they serve as “gate-keepers” of trading on securities exchanges. The verdict was related to a case in which a broker’s client tried to manipulate a stock’s price through naked short selling, reports Oilprice.com. The ruling recognises that not only are broker-dealers the gate-keepers who can enable illegal naked short selling, but they are responsible, and thus liable for their customers’ actions.

Home sales

Home sales in the US fell to a 13-year low in September. High interest rates have hurt demand, but it is also limiting the inventory of homes on the market keeping prices high. That’s because homeowners with low rates are unwilling to sell and move, reports WSJ.

Interest rates

In a speech to the Economic Club of New York, Fed boss Jerome Powell acknowledged that inflation was showing signs of cooling, but reiterated that the central bank would be “resolute” in bringing down inflation to 2 percent. The good part is that he gave no indication of more rate hikes near term, but the not-so-good news is that interest rates are unlikely to come down anytime soon.

Shares of China’s tech heavyweights like Tencent Holdings, Alibaba Group and JD.com Inc are feeling the brunt of foreign money managers dumping Chinese equities, reports Bloomberg, quoting data by EPFR Global and Morgan Stanley. Foreign funds have net sold $1.6 billion this month on top a $3.5 billion net sales last month.

The zinc market’s shift to surplus after two years of supply deficit is because to weaker-than-expected demand and higher-than-expected production, writes Andy Home in mining.com.

Shares of ITC fell around 1.5 percent in early trade on October 20, a day after the hotels-to-cigarettes conglomerate reported its lowest cigarettes volume growth in the September quarter, its biggest source of revenue. Aside from that, ITC’s net profit and revenue were largely in line with the Street's estimates even as margins were a miss.

It was also after nine straight quarters of double-digit EBITDA growth that ITC reported mid-single-digit growth in the July-September period which also dampened investor sentiment.

At 09.37 am, shares of ITC were trading 1.1 percent lower at Rs 445.45 on the NSE.

Brokerages remain hopeful of seeing gradual growth in ITC's various verticals which makes them bullish over the conglomerate despite anticipating some near-term jitters like moderation in earnings, volume growth slowdown in the cigarettes business and high raw material costs.

ITC's strong growth in the September quarter was led by its FMCG, stationery, cigarettes and hotels business, while agri and paperboard segments remained weak.

The hotel business delivered record-high revenues on robust average revenue per room (ARRs) despite occupancy levels being flattish as compared to the previous quarter, the company said on October 19.

Brokerage views

The company also managed to claw back some volumes from illicit trade on the back of deterrent actions by enforcement agencies and relative stability in taxes. Despite that, cigarette volume growth moderated to a multi-year low of just 4 percent on year, brokerage firm Jefferies said.

Nuvama Institutional Equities, however, expects legal cigarette players to gain market share from illegal players (almost one–fourth of the market), given a nominal tax hike in the union budget for FY24 (followed by two consecutive years of no tax hikes). ""Being the largest legal player, ITC would be a key beneficiary,"" the firm said in a note.

Morgan Stanley also sees growth delivery in cigarette volumes as the key to ITC's outperformance in the coming quarters.

Follow our live blog for all the market action

Some moderation in ITC's earnings growth was triggered by the paperboard segment, which saw a 10 percent revenue decline along with a sharp margin contraction.

The company attributed the weakness to the demand slump in Europe and the supply glut from China, which impacted prices. The escalation in wood and coal costs also impacted margins.

Jefferies does not foresee this weakness sustaining for long, saying green shoots were visible towards quarter-end which should help demand in the second half of FY24.

Expectations for the company's FMCG business are also strong. Nuvama said margin expansion is on the right trajectory, as ITC aims for market share gains across FMCG categories.

Jefferies also drew attention to ITC's valuation, which comes at 25 times its expected FY25 earnings. The brokerage said ITC's valuations are palatable in a sector which enjoys excessive premium.

On that account, Jefferies retained its 'buy' call on ITC, with a price target of Rs 530, reflecting an around 17 percent upside potential from Thursday's closing price. Nuvama also has a 'buy' rating for ITC with a price target of Rs 560 which represents scope for a 24 percent upside potential.

Not just that, Morgan Stanley also has an 'overweight' call on the stock, as its forecasts a 10 percent upside to Rs 493 in the next 12-months.

Hotels-to-FMCG major ITC on October 19 reported a standalone net profit of Rs 4,926.96 crore for the September quarter of the current financial year, a growth of 10.32 percent from the year-ago period.

Revenue from operations came in at Rs 17,705.08 crore, up 3.17 percent from Rs 17,159.56 crore in the year-ago quarter, the company said in a regulatory filing.

The numbers more-or-less met estimates. According to a poll of four brokerages the net profit was expected at Rs 4,933.9 crore and revenue at Rs 16,870 crore.

During the quarter, FMCG excluding cigarettes segment revenue was up 8.3 percent year-on-year (YoY). Segment EBITDA margin expanded 150 bps YoY to 11 percent.

ITC said atta, spices, personal wash and agarbatti drove growth during the quarter amidst relatively subdued consumer demand environment. In the stationery business, Classmate notebooks and pens witnessed ""strong growth"" on YoY basis.

Cigarettes segment revenue was up 8.5 percent YoY. The company said it saw sustained volume claw back from illicit trade on the back of deterrent actions by enforcement agencies and relative stability in taxes.

""Sharp escalation in costs of leaf tobacco and certain other inputs, along with increase in taxes, (were) largely mitigated through improved mix, strategic cost management and calibrated pricing,"" ITC said.

Hotels business saw record high second quarter performance, the company said, with segment revenue and PBIT (profit before interest and taxes) up 21 percent and 50 percent YoY, respectively, on a high base. Segment EBITDA margin up 170 bps YoY to 30.7 percent driven by higher RevPAR (revenue per available room), structural cost interventions and operating leverage.

Agri business segment revenue was up 26.4 percent YoY (excl. wheat and rice exports segment)."

“People say the market is overvalued. But if you are only looking at certain names, you will always find times when those names are undervalued. That's what we're waiting for.” - Chuck Akre

Focus will be on the FMCG sector as Nestle, HUL, ITC and Tata Coffee gear up to report their earnings today. A host of others like PVR Inox, Metro Brands and United Breweries too should give some indication of the consumer mood. Rural demand remains on a shaky ground as stagnant incomes and erratic monsoon rain could again hinder consumers during the festive season, write my colleagues Adrija Chatterjee and Pallavi Singhal. FMCG companies that were battling low rural demand for several quarters are cautiously hopeful.

Bajaj Finance

The stock was down 3 percent on Wednesday despite strong numbers. The argument whether the company will be able to maintain its strong growth on a high base appears to be settled. The numbers over the last few quarters clearly show it can. But the market has been slow to reward the feat. This despite positive analyst rating outnumbering negative ratings by a mile for most part of the last couple of years. HSBC sees net interest margins contracting over next two-three quarters by 25-30 bps, as the company may not pass the higher cost of funds to clients. A sign that competition has begun to heat up with the entry of Jio Financial. That said, HSBC says the lower margins will be offset by strong growth in loan book and operating leverage.

Wipro

The stock fell 1 percent on Wednesday. Second-quarter numbers of the IT major has been unimpressive, according to analysts. CEO Delaporte says there is plenty to cheer about. Deal wins at a nine-quarter high, number of clients spending $100 million plus have doubled over FY21, the company is winning in the market place, margins are steady as the focus is on more of high margin deals, and because bookings are strong, the rebound when it happens will be swift. But analysts tracking the stock seem to be looking at it from a ‘here and now’ lens. This is what the folks at Nomura, Goldman Sachs and HSBC see: Margin expansion lower than peers, signs of market share loss, high valuations not supported by business growth, margin improvement unlikely this year, more market share loss likely near term.

Wipro shares saw the sharpest post-Covid rally among frontline IT stocks, with the price surging four-fold in 22 months and crossing the previous record high last seen in 2000. But since then it has also been the biggest underperformer among peers, down nearly 40 percent from those highs. Wipro’s earnings story over the last 20-plus years has been more of disappointments and the occasional flashes of brilliance. Wipro bears argue that the company’s peers offer a much more compelling case for investment in case one is looking to bet on the sector. Bulls say there is little to lose at these levels, and given that disappointment is so widespread, a slight improvement in earnings could easily make up for a few years of underperformance.

Hudco

The stock is down 11 percent as market appears unhappy with the government planning to offload more shares through offer-for-sale (OFS) than what it had proposed earlier. It will now sell 14 crore shares (7 percent), instead of 7 crore (3.5 percent). Was the correction purely because of the development? Remember, the stock has more than doubled from the March lows. Also, trading volumes over the last few sessions does not seem to indicate distribution (early buyers getting out). Appetite for PSU stocks in general continues to be positive. And housing is among the sectors that the market is hot on right now. And, right now, there are enough examples where the stocks have rallied even after the government selling shares, HAL being a prime example.

US bond yields

The 10-year US Treasury yield surged to a 16-year high of 4.902 percent and continues to dent enthusiasm for stocks. That is because if you can easily make 5 percent without losing sleep, risky assets such as equities need to deliver a much higher return. And that does not look easy at a time when valuations are already high and the risks of a slowdown are increasing, thanks to high interest rates.

Netflix

Netflix added nearly 8.8 million subscribers in the September quarter, beating analyst estimates. Highest addition in nine quarters when it gained 10 million subscribers during the June quarter of 2020. The stock is still 43 percent off its record high of $691 seen in November 2021.

From CNBC:

Still, it’s now clear that Netflix has entered a new chapter. It’s unclear exactly how long the password sharing crackdown runway is for growth in the coming quarters. Netflix previously estimated about 100 million households share passwords, but it’s still unclear how many of these moochers will actually subscribe to accounts of their own — and for how long.

Gold

Gold jumped to an 11-week high on Wednesday as the escalating conflict in the Middle East is prompting investors to flock towards the safe-haven metal. “Gold will pull back if the Middle East situation simmers down, but right now market expecting further escalation,” Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco Metals, told Reuters, adding the technical indicators were positive and that gold will push above $2,000 in the near term.

Crude

Some commodity experts are now saying the oil markets have underpriced the risk of an escalation of the Israel-Hamas conflict, and that oil prices could skyrocket if that happens, reports Oilprice.com. Commodity analysts at Standard Chartered say a medium-term reduction in Iranian oil exports as being the most likely consequence of shifts in the geopolitical landscape. According to StanChart, global oil demand has already exceeded the pre-Covid oil demand set in August 2019, averaging 102.33 million barrels per day (mb/d) and there are no signs of high oil prices hurting demand.

China

China’s third-quarter gross domestic product figures released Wednesday has surpassed expectations on strong consumer spending, but the housing sector continues to be a drag, reports Bloomberg. The strong data means the target of 5 percent growth for 2023 is within reach and more stimulus is unlikely for now. And yet the data points to difficult months ahead as the efforts to boost the property sector have not been effective so far."

ITC Ltd is likely to report a healthy 10.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in net profit in Q2 FY24, primarily led by sales of cigarettes, price hikes in FMCG products, and strong demand in the hotels segment. The cigarette and FMCG company will announce its Q2FY24 earnings on October 19.

ITC Ltd's Q2FY24 net profit is likely to come in at Rs 4,889 crore for the July-September quarter, per the mean consensus of four brokerage estimates. Standalone revenue for the quarter is expected to grow 4.6 percent YoY to Rs 17,216 crore. Operating profit margins are likely to rise moderately, by 68 basis points YoY to 37 percent.

Where is the growth likely to come from?

ITC’s cigarette segment is expected to grow 8.9 percent in value and 5 percent in volume considering a normal base and increased out-of-home consumption, said Shirish Pardeshi and Soham Samanta of Centrum Institutional Research.

The company’s FMCG segment is expected to report YoY revenue growth of 12 percent on the back of price hikes, said Kotak Institutional Equities.

The hotel segment may report a 12.5 percent YoY jump, with strong domestic tourism demand and heightened demand from corporate bookings, said Pardeshi and Samanta of Centrum.

ITC’s board approved the demerger of ITC Hotels in August. Under the terms of the demerger, shareholders will get one share of the hotel business for every 10 shares held in ITC. The new entity will be listed in about 13 months.

Raw materials

Prices of key raw materials for ITC, sugar and wheat, have increased on a (YoY) as well as on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis. Wheat prices have surged 5.4 percent and 8.1 percent on a YoY and QoQ basis, respectively, as per Prabhudas Lilladher, while sugar prices have gone up by 6 percent YoY and 3 percent QoQ in the July-to-September quarter.

The biscuit category has not seen any significant price hikes over the last six months. However, ITC’s Sunfeast Marie Light, Sunfeast Glucose, and Sunfeast’s Mom’s Magic biscuits have seen price hikes ranging from 5-15 percent.

“In the soap category, most companies took price cuts due to increasing competitive intensity. Except for Lux, other brands have taken price cuts in the range of 0-4 percent,” said BNP Paribas in a report dated September 25. Palm oil, a key ingredient in soap manufacturing, has corrected 4.2 percent YoY in Q2FY24, as per Prabhudas Lilladher.

Shares of ITC opened 0.40 percent higher on October 5, a day after the GST Council's Fitment Committee rejected a tobacco industry proposal to effectively cut tax rates. As of 9:40 am, the stock was trading 0.66 percent higher at Rs 438.85.

The tobacco industry had proposed a uniform additional compensation cess on cigarettes, bidis, smokeless tobacco products, and lower compensation cess on cigarette sticks up to 70 mm. Separately, auto component industry had also sought lowering of GST on electric vehicle (EV) batteries from 18 percent to 5 percent. according to a Moneycontrol report.

Sources told Moneycontrol that the GST Council Fitment Committee has rejected the EV batteries tax proposal too.

This move could impact stocks of cigarette-manufacturing companies like ITC. Cigarette continue to contribute to a majority of ITC's business, which is also involved in agri products, hotels, and non-cigarette FMCG products. In Q1FY24, ITC’s cigarette business saw a 13 percent growth in revenue at Rs 7,465.27 crore, year on year.

Currently, tobacco products such as cigarettes, chewing tobacco, gutkha, etc. attract GST, Compensation Cess, Basic Excise Duty, and National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD), while Bidis attract GST, Basic Excise Duty, and NCCD.

According to a CNBC TV18 report, sources said that considering that there is no compensation cess on bidis, the tobacco industry sought rationalisation of compensation cess on products such as 70mm cigarettes. However, the fitment committee felt that the change is not required as the bidi industry is a small scale industry and so it was kept free from cess.

The Nifty showed a strong recovery on September 27, finding support at the 50-day EMA (exponential moving average) of 19,550, and ended the day forming a bullish engulfing pattern.

On the upper side, the resistance is at 19,750. A clear breakout is necessary to anticipate a substantial rally in the index. A decisive move beyond 19,750 could potentially push the index towards 19,900. On the downside, support is established at 19,600.

Bank Nifty bulls displayed resilience by defending the key support level at 44,200, which coincided with the rising trendline support. However, the index is trading below its 20-day moving average (20DMA) at 45,000. A decisive break above this level could trigger significant short-covering.

The Bank Nifty is trading within a broad range of 44,200 to 45,000. A clear break on either side of this range will likely lead to trending moves. Within this range, the overall sentiment remains bullish, suggesting that a 'buy on dips' approach may be favourable.

Here are three buy calls for short term:

Motilal Oswal Financial Services: Buy | LTP: Rs 881.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 840 | Targets: Rs 920-960 | Return: 9 percent

The stock found strong support at the descending trendline, accompanied by a notable increase in trading volumes. It has surpassed its previous week's high with a significant surge in trading volumes, confirming a bullish reversal.

Key support is evident at Rs 840 levels, which is expected to act as a buffer for the bulls. The stock's potential upside targets are set at Rs 920 and Rs 960, indicating further room for growth.

ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 449 | Stop-Loss: Rs 440 | Target: Rs 465-470 | Return: 5 percent

The Bullish Engulfing candle formation on the daily chart, indicating a potential bullish reversal. Positive divergence is observed on the daily chart, confirming strength and a potential reversal. The stock has crossed above its 20-day moving average (20DMA) on strong trading volumes and has exceeded the high of the previous two days.

Key support is evident at Rs 440 levels, providing a solid foundation for potential upward movement. The stock's potential upside targets are set at Rs 465 and Rs 470, indicating scope for further price appreciation.

RBL Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 245 | Stop-Loss: Rs 239 | Targets: Rs 255-260 | Return: 6 percent

RBL Bank has experienced a symmetrical triangle breakout on the daily chart, indicating a surge in optimism. The stock has maintained its position above a critical moving average.

Furthermore, the stock's RSI (relative strength index) is showing a bullish crossover. On the upper side, it has the potential to move towards Rs 260. On the lower side, support is situated at Rs 239.

The combined market valuation of eight of the 10 most valued firms plunged by Rs 2,28,690.56 crore in a holiday-shortened last week, with HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries taking the biggest hit, amid an overall weak trend in equities.

Last week, the BSE benchmark fell 1,829.48 points or 2.69 per cent, and the Nifty declined 518.1 points or 2.56 per cent. Equity markets were closed on Tuesday on account of Ganesh Chaturthi. From the top-10 pack, Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Infosys, ITC, State Bank of India, Bharti Airtel and Bajaj Finance were the laggards while Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Hindustan Unilever were the gainers.

The market valuation of HDFC Bank plummeted by Rs 99,835.27 crore to Rs 11,59,154.60 crore. Shares of the company fell by nearly 8 per cent last week. The valuation of Reliance Industries plunged Rs 71,715.6 crore to Rs 15,92,661.42 crore.

The Sensex and the Nifty closed below their all-time highs on September 12 after rallying for seven sessions in a row. Midcaps and smallcaps saw a sharp fall, with 90 percent of stocks ending in the red. Midcap and small-cap indices recorded the biggest single-day fall of 2023.

The Nifty50 index showed profit-booking at the 20,000 mark after a strong rally from the 19,200 levels. This is not surprising as 20,000 is a psychological level and many investors may have taken profits at that point.

The next hurdle for the Nifty is 20,164. If the index breaches this level, it may move up to the 20,300 and 20,500 levels. However, if the index fails to break 20,164, it could come down to the 19,950 levels, which is the first and key support.

The overall trend of the Nifty is still positive and it is likely to continue to move up in the medium term. However, there could be some profit-booking at the 20,000 level and the index may consolidate for some time before moving up again.

Bank Nifty has also showed profit-booking in the last trading session after witnessing a breakout of W-formation above 45,000. The immediate resistance zone for Bank Nifty is 45,800. If the index can break this level, it could move up to 46,300 levels. However, if the index fails to break the 45,800 levels, it could come down to 45,100-44,900 levels, which is the immediate demand zone.

Here are three buy calls for short term:

Infosys: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,501 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,460 | Target: Rs 1,584 | Return: 6 percent

The counter has witnessed the breakout of an ascending triangle formation with huge volume. The breakout coincides with rising volume, and it manages to sustain above the breakout level despite weakness in the broader market.

It is trading above its all-important moving averages with a positive bias in momentum indicators. On the downside, Rs 1,475 will act as a strong support; below this, Rs 14,60 is the next support levels.

It is respecting its 9 and 20-DMA beautifully, which is a classic sign of trend strength.

Narayana Hrudayalaya: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,040 | Stop-Loss: Rs 970 | Target: Rs 1,160 | Return: 12 percent

The counter is in a classical uptrend where it is forming a symmetrical triangle formation after building a strong base at its 9, 20, and 50-DMA. A breakout will be confirmed when it crosses Rs 1,050.

On an immediate basis, Rs 1,050 is the horizontal resistance line; above this, we can expect a rally towards Rs 1,160 levels.

On the downside, Rs 970 is an immediate and strong support. Momentum indicators are positively poised to support the current strength of the trend.

ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 451 | Stop-Loss: Rs 435 | Target: Rs 476 | Return: 5.5 percent

After a classical move, the counter has moved into the consolidation phase, but it is trying to bottom out and will move towards Rs 460. The structure of the counter looks lucrative for long-term investors, as it is trading above all its important moving averages.

Both the RSI (relative strength index) and MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicators are supportive of the current strength in the stock's momentum.

On the upside, Rs 460 is an important psychological level; above this, we can expect a move towards Rs 476+. On the downside, a cluster of moving averages at around Rs 435 is a strong demand zone during any correction.

ITC Limited has been asked to pay Rs 1 lakh to customer for packing one biscuit less than advertised on a packet of Sunfeast Marie Light. The case of the missing biscuit unfolded when a Chennai resident, P Dillibabu, bought a packet of ITC’s Sunfeast Marie Light biscuits to feed stray dogs. The customer noticed that even though the wrapper mentioned 16 biscuits, there were only 15 biscuits inside the pack.

Dillibabu reached out to his local store as well as ITC for an explanation but did not receive a satisfactory response, according to Times of India.

He filed a complaint with a consumer court, noting that each biscuit costs 75 paise. In his complaint, he said that ITC manufactures 50 lakh packets of biscuits a day. Going by these numbers, the company is cheating consumers of Rs 29 lakh every day.

ITC argued that biscuits are sold based on weight, not number. The net weight mentioned on each packet of Sunfeast Marie Light is 76 grams. However, the court found that each pack containing 15 biscuits weighed only 74 grams.

ITC then argued that Legal Metrology Rules of 2011 allowed a maximum discrepancy of 4.5 grams in pre-packaged goods. However, the court rejected this explanation saying such exemptions are valid only in case of volatile products. The rule does not apply to biscuits since they don’t lose weight over time.

Moreover, the argument that biscuits were sold based on weight, not number, was also dismissed because ITC mentioned 16 biscuits on the wrapper.

The FMCG giant was ordered on August 29 to pay Rs 1 lakh to Dillibabu as compensation for adopting unfair trade practices. It has also been ordered to stop the sale of that particular batch of biscuits."

Diversified group ITC on Sunday said it will invest around Rs 1,500 crore to set up an integrated food manufacturing and logistics facility and a sustainable packaging products manufacturing facility at Sehore in Madhya Pradesh.

The two projects spread over an area of nearly 57 acres will give a boost to agricultural and manufacturing sectors in Madhya Pradesh, ITC said in a statement.

""The two projects, when complete, would entail a total investment outlay of Rs 1,500 crores which will support livelihoods across sustainable value chains,"" it said.

While the food plant will manufacture ITC's products including atta brand Aashirvaad, Sunfeast biscuits, and 'YiPPee!' noodles, the moulded fibre products facility will be a pioneer in sustainable packaging, contributing to plastic substitution in areas such as packaging for electronic items, FMCG, and the food and beverage sector.

""ITC's investment in the food processing sector through the facility at Sehore is poised to add value to the state's manufacturing sector and support inclusive agri-value chains.

""ITC believes that the food processing sector, being at the intersection of agriculture, industry and services, can make a multi-dimensional contribution to the state's economy by enhancing the competitiveness of the food value chain,"" it said.

Commenting on new investment projects at Sehore, Chairman Sanjiv Puri said ITC has, over the years, expanded its footprint across all three sectors of Madhya Pradesh's economy agriculture, manufacturing and services.

""In line with our commitment to contribute to the socio-economic development of the state, we are now investing in two world-class facilities including the Integrated Food Manufacturing and Logistics Facility and the Sustainable Packaging Products Manufacturing Facility at Sehore.

""This state-of-art facility will also be a landmark in sustainability with the unit being designed to IGBC green building Platinum standards.,"" he said.

A foundation laying ceremony was held on Sunday, in which Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was present.

As inflation is moderating, diversified group ITC is seeing green shoots of volume growth and expects the momentum to continue sequentially, its Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said on Sunday.

This will certainly lead to improvement in volume, but it will not happen overnight, said Puri in New Delhi on the sidelines of the B20 Summit organised by the CII.

Over the ITC's plan for the demerger of its hotel business, Puri said it is going to benefit the existing shareholders by incorporating a wholly-owned new subsidiary ITC Hotels Ltd.

""It will be a pure-play, focused on hospitality, which can leverage the institutional strengths of ITC. And ITC in turn will be able to leverage the synergy on its hospitality business, or its FMCG businesses,"" Puri told PTI.

It is a ""very robust"" model, which will help the business to make the hotel business accelerate progress, whilst retaining synergies and it will improve the financial metrics of ITC, he added.

Over inflation, Puri said this is mainly on account of two factors - the bigger one is more of the external factors in the geopolitical environment and the second is on account of the issues of climate change.

""However, now, India is much better placed in the rest of the world and I would like to compliment the government for stewarding management of inflation and being extremely proactive in taking the right steps to control that,"" he said.

In the recently concluded June quarter, ITC and several other FMCG makers reported volume gains and improvement in margins. ITC has 25 brands including Aashirvaad, Bingo, Sunfeast, YiPPee, Fiama, Vivel, Savlon etc.

When asked about the revival of consumer sentiments and volume growth, especially in the rural market, Puri said, ""So we are already seeing green shoots of pickup on volumes as inflation is moderating. I think as inflation moderates, we are also seeing the prices in the market growing or climate is improving."" He expressed concerns that the operating environment continues to remain volatile on the weather front.

""Right now, the El Nino is the monitorable. The rains in August have not been very encouraging. That's the facet we need to be watchful about. But overall, I think we have been able to manage it quite well,"" said Puri.

The Kolkata-headquartered firm reported a 16.08 per cent rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 5,180.12 crore in the June quarter. However, its revenue was down 6 per cent to Rs 18,639.48 crore, impacted by its agribusiness division.

Its revenue from the FMCG-others segment, which houses businesses such as staples, snacks, meals, dairy and beverages, apparel, education and stationery products, and personal care products was up 16 per cent to Rs 5,172.71 crore.

Over the agribusiness, Puri said, India has ""tremendous"" potential for the agriculture sector and the opportunity is immense.

""We have the largest arable land, we account for just about 3 per cent of the global trade on agriculture and because of... headroom to grow by vertical growth activity, and huge headroom to go through value addition and opportunities events, because by 2050, it is estimated that the world would need 70 per cent more agri produce to meet the needs of the entire planet,"" he said.

So it is an area of opportunity and we need to ""improve productivity, improve market linkages, and build resilience"" in the agriculture value system, he said.

""And those are really the three things that need to be done. In ITC, We are trying to contribute towards climate-smart agriculture and the first part on productivity and quality or market linkages to the ITC Mars system.

ITC expects the public listing of its hotel business, to take place in the next 15 months. Its hotels business clocked its best-ever Q1 at Rs 600 crore in FY24.

Under the scheme of demerger, ITC Hotels will issue equity shares directly to the shareholders of ITC in a manner that about 60 per cent stake is held directly by ITC shareholders, proportionate to their shareholding in ITC and the remaining about 40 per cent stake to continue with ITC."

Motilal Oswal's research report on ITC

ITC reported healthy cigarette volume growth of ~8% in 1QFY24 vs. our estimate of 5%. The 3-year/4-year average volume CAGRs stood at 21.7%/7.0%, indicating strong demand momentum. With no material increase in Cigarette GST/National Calamities Duty, the volume growth outlook remains healthy. Unlike its staple peers, ITC has consistently posted impressive performance in the Other FMCG business (16% revenue growth and margin improvement despite elevated RM costs compared to pre-pandemic levels). The Agri business faced setbacks due to export restrictions, while the Paper segment was affected by demand issues, competition from China, lower pulp prices, and higher input costs. However, the Hotels segment reported a robust performance. We maintain BUY on ITC as we believe its earnings visibility remains better than peers’.



Outlook

At a time when uncertainty looms over the industry, led by high inflation, unpredictable monsoons and continued weak rural sales, ITC’s recovery in Cigarette volumes offer decent earnings visibility at reasonable valuations and attractive dividend yield. We maintain our BUY rating with a TP of INR535, based on 28x FY25E EPS.

Cigarettes-to-hotel conglomerate ITC, which posted better-than-expected numbers for the June quarter and is demerging the hotel business, is all set to expand its cloud-kitchen operations to strengthen growth in the consumer business.

ITC forayed into cloud kitchen with three brands— Master Chef Creations, Aashirvaad Soul Creations and Sunfeast Baked Creations— which operated in Bengaluru.

“We are now gearing up to take the (cloud kitchen) offering to other cities,” ITC chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri said at the company’s 112th Annual General Meeting.

The company has over two decades built a strong packed foods portfolio across several categories including staples, spices, biscuits, confectionary, gums, snacks, noodles and pasta, beverages, juices, chocolate, coffee, frozen foods and ready-to-eat foods. Cloud kitchen is its latest push.

“Having established the product market fit successfully in Bengaluru with three brands, and delivered through 19 cloud kitchens, we are now gearing up to take the offering to other cities,” Puri said at the AGM on August 11.

A cloud kitchen uses a commercial kitchen for preparing food for delivery or takeout only, with no dine-in customers. Cloud kitchens enable restaurateurs to expand an existing restaurant or start a virtual brand at a minimal cost.

The Indian cloud kitchen market is expected to reach $1.9 billion by FY26, according to consultancy firm Wazir. In FY22 it was at $800 million.

In February 2022, ITC Master Chef Creations and ITC Sunfeast Baked Creations partnered with Kitchens@, a cloud kitchen brand for a pilot.

The partnership enabled ITC to enter the food-service industry while operating from several cloud kitchens across Bengaluru.

Puri also said that ITC was combining two big trends, digital technology and sustainability. ITCMAARS, a smart farming app, sustainable packaging, and food tech were the vectors borne out by combining the two big trends.

At 11.02 am, ITC was trading at Rs 442.40 on the National Stock Exchange, down 1.74 percent from the previous close.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC reported another quarter of strong growth across segments. Cigarette volume growth for 1Q was ~9.8% supported by stability in taxes, and volume recovery from illicit trade. Outlook remains positive although we expect growth to moderate to mid-single digits in medium term. FMCG growth was ahead of industry and margins got a boost due to improving scale, lower raw material costs and PLI incentives, we expect calibrated margin expansion to sustain in coming years. Hotel outlook is positive (despite planned renovations) due to G20 and revival in business & foreign tourist travel. Paper and Paperboard segment has started showing QoQ margin expansion and margins are expected to sustain around current levels. ITC has announced swap ratio of 1:10 for ITC Hotels demerger which is likely to be completed over next 15 months, it will improve ROCE and cash flows.

Axis Securities report on ITC

The company’s Q1FY24 results were robust as it remained strong in all segments. The Cigarettes segment continued its strong momentum with volume growth of 8% vs. our estimates of 7%, led by market share gains from illicit trade, targeted market interventions and new product launches. FMCG/Hotels maintained its strong growth momentum, while Agri/Paper board business declined due to the wheat ban and subdued demand in the paperboard business. Gross revenue (excluding agri-business) grew by 10.6% YoY. Demerger of the hotel business – The share entitlement ratio has been set at 1 share for every 10 shares of ITC. The demerger is expected to be completed by Sep'24, while the listing of the shares is expected to take place in Nov'24. We believe that the ITC business continues to strengthen as all businesses are on track: – 1) Growth in cigarette volume is stable, thanks to stable taxation, market share gains and new product launches; 2) FMCG business has reached the inflection point as EBIT margins continue to increase, driven by – the ramp up in the outlet coverage, effective implementation of localization strategy, premiumization, use of demand and supply side technologies, and moderating raw material input cost;3) Demerger of Hotel’s business will strengthen ITC’s balance sheet and improve return ratios; 4) Stable and decent performance in paperboard and agribusiness continues. In addition, the reasonable valuation provides a margin of safety.

Outlook

We estimate the company to post Revenue/EBITDA/PAT growth of 10%/12%/12% CAGR over FY23-26E and maintain a BUY rating on the stock with a unchanged TP of Rs 540/share. We value the company at 27x June-25 EPS. The TP implies an upside of 20% from the CMP.

Segment results

Revenue from cigarettes was up 13 percent YoY at Rs 7,465 crore in the April-June quarter. Steady cigarette taxes, coupled with strong enforcement measures, have aided the legal cigarette industry in reclaiming some volumes lost to illicit trade, said ITC in its Q1FY24 investor presentation.

Revenue from hotel business grew 8.1 percent YoY to Rs 600 crore in Q1FY24. The hotel business witnesses strong growth in average revenue per room across properties which led revenue growth for ITC.

ITC Ltd's board is expected to approve the demerger of the hotels business on August 14 when it gives the nod to Q1 results, unlocking value and sharpening the parent company’s focus as well as capital allocation towards the core businesses.

ITC will retain a 40 percent stake in the new demerged hotels entity, while the rest will be distributed among shareholders in proportion to their holding in the parent company. If an investor, for instance, owns a 1 percent stake, they will hold a 0.6 percent stake in ITC Hotels directly and an additional 0.4 percent through their stake in ITC Ltd.

The decision to not split the unit fully didn't sit well with the market. ITC share fell as much as 4 percent a day after the announcement nearly three weeks ago. However, domestic and international brokerages issued positive comments shortly thereafter.

Unlocking value

Global research and broking firms Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Nomura issued or maintained favourable calls on ITC stock, with target prices of just under Rs 500.

Morgan Stanley said the separation of the hotel business would alleviate concerns about the allocation of capital and the utilisation of cash flows from the cigarette business for other ventures.

The decision could assist ITC's hotels business in defining its distinct trajectory of growth. The brokerage maintains an “overweight” position on ITC, setting a target price of Rs 474, which encompasses Rs 17 designated for the hotels sector.

Also read: ITC Preview | Net profit may rise 4.6% in Q1, cigarette volumes likely to grow 8%

Goldman Sachs, too, was positive on the demerger, saying the hotels division was a capital-intensive component within ITC, contributing merely 2 percent to its EBIT but consuming 20 percent of the employed capital.

The firm assigned a value of Rs 12 to the hotels sector in its sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) evaluation, within its overall target price of Rs 470 for ITC.

Nomura regards the demerger as a strategic manoeuvre, potentially leading to the unlocking of latent value.

According to Nomura, the separation could facilitate enhancements in ITC's financial structure, capital distribution, and Return on Capital Employed (RoCE) metrics.

Another favourable aspect stemming from the demerger would be the surplus cash generated and an augmented dividend payout profile due to the elimination of capital expenditure requirements for the hotels segment, it said.

Nomura endorsed ITC’s decision to maintain control over the newly established entity. It has a “buy” call on ITC, with a target price of Rs 485.

Domestic brokerages Emkay and Nuvama’s target prices are above Rs 500.

Emkay Financial Services said it would await greater clarity regarding ITC's rationale behind retaining a 40 percent stake in the newly formed entity, the structure of royalties, potential tax implications and the principal criteria for securing a strategic investor or partner for the venture.

Emkay said it anticipates further value unlocking for ITC as the company looks to secure a strategic business investor. The brokerage retained its “buy” recommendation for the stock, with a target price of Rs 525.

Nuvama put the target price at Rs 560, saying the demerger would unlock shareholder value. Prabhudas Lilladher raised its target price from Rs 455 to Rs 478, while upholding its “accumulate” recommendation.

ITC's share price has fallen over 5 percent since July 24, when in-principle nod was given to the split, to Rs 449.20 on August 19. It has returned over 34 percent this year against the under 7 percent rise in the Nifty.

Cigarettes-to-hotels conglomerate ITC Ltd is expected to report a net profit of Rs 4,838.8 crore for the April to June quarter on August 14, according to the average of six brokerages polled by Moneycontrol. It shows a 4.6 percent increase over last year and a 10.3 percent growth on a sequential basis.

The company's revenue is pegged at Rs 17,326 crore for the first quarter of FY24, marking a year-on-year increase of 14.9 percent. Sequentially, revenue is likely to decline 4.8 percent.

Its operating profit margin is likely to be 36.2 percent, a 404 basis points expansion on-year, along with a sequential fall of 117 basis points.

Cigarette volumes are expected to grow 8.06 percent YoY in the April-to-June quarter. Kotak Institutional Equities expect the cigarette EBIT margin to contract 50 basis points sequentially and to remain flat on-year because of inflation in tobacco prices.

Kotak Institutional Equities said that ITC’s agri business is expected to decline 23 percent on-year in Q1FY24 on a high base. Another reason for the decline in agribusiness revenues is the banning of wheat exports."

Diversified conglomerate ITC Limited on Friday said the FMCG business has immense potential for growth with its brands commanding an annual consumer spend of Rs 29,000 crore.

Speaking at the 112th AGM of the company, ITC chairman Sanjiv Puri told shareholders in his address that the FMCG brands are being exported to several countries and the business vertical has immense growth potential due to the rising per capita income of the people.

""The ITC Next strategy for the FMCG business is to build a future-ready portfolio. With more than 25 brands at the moment, the annual consumer spend is around Rs 29,000 crore"", Puri said.

He said that the addressable market for the FMCG vertical of ITC is USD five trillion. ""The business has immense opportunity to harness this potential"", Puri added.

Regarding the hotel business, the ITC board had given in-principle approval to demerge the vertical and spin it off into a new entity.

Puri said that the business is well poised to capitalise on the growth potential of the tourism sector growing.

""We have pivoted to an asset-right strategy. With 120 hotels at the moment under ITC fold, managed properties comprise 55 per cent of the total rooms"", he said.

Regarding the cigarette business, he said the company has been introducing new brands with stability in the taxation regime, sales volumes are increasing.

The 'ITC Next' strategy - aimed to build a future-ready portfolio - will help prepare the FMCG giant for greater competitiveness and profitability in times of global uncertainty, said Sanjiv Puri, Chairman and Managing Director at the company’s 112th AGM.

“We recognise that this journey will be traversed in an era of unprecedented uncertainties, making it mission critical to be extremely agile, consumer-centric, competitive and resilient.” he said.

Puri said that ITC has seen a commendable surge in its gross revenue by 18 percent in FY23. Its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBIDTA) grew over 26 percent, with non-cigarette EBIDTA witnessing a sharp increase of 43 percent, reflecting strong growth across all business segments.

The non-cigarette business of ITC now accounts for 67 percent of the revenue, contributing to 28 percent of segment EBIDTA. From FY17 to FY23, the cigarettes-to-hotels conglomerate recorded a turnover growth of 1.8 times, while its EBIDTA margins expanded significantly by 770 basis points.

On the global front, since FY17, ITC's export earnings have exceeded $5 billion. Agricultural products, bridging Indian farmers with the international market, comprise over 60 percent of these earnings. Testament to their global reach, ITC’s FMCG brands are now available in over 100 countries.

In line with its expansion strategy, ITC rolled out five factories and a luxury hotel, and has lined up investments in four more facilities.

Underlining its commitment to sustainability, Puri said ITC completed 20 years of sustainability reporting in sync with the company's mission, supporting approximately 6 million livelihoods.

"August 11, 2023 10:28 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/d2c-consolidation-value-creation-for-fmcg-majors-wealth-creation-for-founders-11137551.html,"While these are strategic investments for large FMCG players, thanks to the tech capabilities and customer database they get in exchange, the deals have largely turned out to be a slump sale for D2C startups

Legacy fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are quickly moving away from selling just hair oil and other traditional products. As these giants diversify into health supplements, herbal products and other categories from the premium segment, founders of direct-to-consumer (D2C) companies are cashing in.

This year alone, FMCG giants such as Marico and ITC have announced several acquisitions. While ITC bought a stake in Yoga Bar, a healthy-snack startup, for Rs 175 crore, VLCC bought shares in men’s grooming company, Ustraa, for Rs 250 crore. More recently, Marico, continuing on its acquisition spree, paid Rs 369 crore for part ownership in Plix. In the past it has also invested in True Elements, Just Herbs and Beardo to widen its portfolio of digital brands.

While these are strategic investments for large FMCG players, thanks to the tech capabilities and customer database they get in exchange, they have turned out to be slump sales for D2C startups in most cases because founders were unable to scale up their businesses beyond a point and those businesses ended up being available at a steep discount.

“It’s a distress sale for D2C companies 95 percent of the time but a win for FMCG players. All these D2c startups are jumping for somebody to give a cheque to them,” said Ankur Bisen, retail head, consumer products and food, Technopak Advisors. He added that the industry now had “a problem of plenty, where not every investor is jumping onto the D2C bandwagon. They're selective and are cherry picking. It's a buyer’s market now, not a seller’s market.”

While scaling revenues from Rs 2 crore to Rs 20 crore is a 10X jump, the potential of the business cannot be gauged based on an increase that sharp.

“Any founder saying they’re selling for synergy purposes at the Rs 50-100 crore level does not make sense. There is no synergy there. At that scale, businesses don't even scratch 0.5 percent of whichever opportunity there is. D2C businesses start to mature only at the Rs 600-1,000 crore level, not before that,” Bisen added.

Interestingly, Plix, Yoga Bar and Ustraa individually had revenue below Rs 70 crore as of FY22, the latest available data on Tracxn showed. Even True Elements, Just Herbs and Beardo separately did not have revenues of more than Rs 70 crore in FY22.

Money matters

Each of the companies mentioned above, however, got a revenue multiple of anywhere between 3 and 7 while getting sold, which means investors and founders made money for themselves during the transactions.

“The primary decision to sell off Beardo was wealth creation. We now have enough money to sustain our lifestyle for the next couple of decades,” said Ashutosh Valani, the co-founder and former CEO of Beardo.

Marico’s acquisition of Beardo was among the first few instances where an FMCG player bet on a new-age D2C player, back in 2017.

“Every founder must have an end goal. Some of the deals happening now are with first-time founders so they’re still figuring out their end goal. A few of those deals are also distress sales where founders have been in the business for 5-10 years but are not able to bring an outcome. However, they’ve still been able to sell to a large FMCG player by chance, and that is probably the most positive outcome for them,” Valani added.

Not just Valani, another founder agreed that the sale to a larger player was driven by the money aspect of the deal.

“Look, I'm a young founder, I want to reap the benefits of what I’ve built. Rs 1,000 crore in the bank at the age of 70 is not as valuable as a couple of $100 mills (millions) in my bank account today,” said a founder, who sold their D2C startup to a large FMCG player, asking not to be named.

Last resort

While some D2C players like Boat and Mamaearth have been able to mop up funds and play the long game on their own, the smaller players have struggled to convince financial investors because of which they have sought refuge under the wings of traditional FMCG players.

Sreejith Moolayil, co-founder of True Elements, a snacks and breakfast company that Marico acquired in 2022, says that food D2C startups especially are on the backfoot when it comes to raising money from venture capitalists (VCs) or private equity (PE) players.

“When I was pitted against a personal care company in front of PE, they saw that the market here (food company) was still nascent, the margins are better in beauty and personal care (BPC); BPC penetration is higher than food, so we were always on the losing side of things,” Moolayil said.

The sale to Marico has opened up distribution channels and its offline reach helped True Elements grow.

Another founder agreed that it was difficult to raise VC money and that is when a large FMCG player provided support. “We could not get VC money. We saw good traction during COVID but then came the lull, when we realised that for the next 2-3 years, we wouldn’t get back that demand and if we didn't have deep pockets, we wouldn’t be able to scale up. Then a strategic investor came through,” the founder said.

Looking for an out

Founders also said it was important to time their exit and choose a strategic investor over a financial one, when it made more business sense.

“...one should decide and time their exit when they know the markets are so difficult that equity dilution makes absolutely no sense. There is a rule book, for every Rs 1 that you raise, it has to result in at least Rs 4 of stable revenue. If that multiple does not play out, one is better off selling the company today rather than continuing,” said Suhasini Sampath, co-founder of Yoga Bar.

The reach of her company’s products will go from 5,000 stores to 20,000 stores only because of the sale to ITC. It would have otherwise stagnated.

“For players like us, it makes sense to choose a strategic partner (ITC), because we’re not going to be constrained by the capital availability in the market now,” she added.

Different FMCG players structure their deals differently. While Sampath said in three years’ time, ITC will compulsorily acquire 100% of Yoga Bar, Marico has other ideas.

Marico has the first right to fully buy out its companies after three years and integrate with the larger brand, but it can also choose to let founders continue to run the business after that timeline.

“Marico is a strategic investor of choice as we believe in incentivizing the promoters to bring a company to its maximum potential,” a senior official from Marico said.

Large FMCG players take about double the time to create similar products in-house and hence an acquisition works better and cheaper for them, experts added.

“The acquisitions of digital-first brands are strategic in nature and help expand the addressable market within categories of interest. We don't acquire just for the sake of bringing more brands under our fold. The idea is to diversify our portfolio from traditional hair oiling and the mass segment to super premium segments” Marico's senior official concluded."

Indian conglomerate ITC is planning to list its hotels business ITC Hotels in the next six to nine months, a report by the Economic Times said, citing people familiar with the matter.

The report further stated that the next course of action is likely to be taken in a board meeting which is slated to be held on August 14.

ITC however did not comment on its decision to list ITC hotels in the next to six to nine months. The conglomerate cited an intimation to the stock exchanges from July 24 that states that the scheme of arrangement shall be placed for approval of the board at its next meeting to be convened on August 14.

The intimation to the bourses states that appropriate announcements and public disclosures in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Board of India's listing regulations and other applicable laws will be made as necessary.

The Board of ITC Limited granted in-principle approval for the demerger of the hotels business under a scheme of arrangement, the company said in a regulatory filing on July 24.

The proposed restructuring would pave the way for the hotel business to operate as a separate entity in the rapidly expanding hospitality industry, focusing on its growth path with an optimal capital structure.

Market participants were hoping for a split mirroring the shareholding pattern. ITC has decided to withhold 40 percent of the newly-carved-out hotel company, and distribute only 60 percent to shareholders.

Markets have been gung-ho about the de-merger because the hotels business has been a drag in ITC’s books. Since hotels are a capital-intensive business, it has always delivered significantly lower return on capital than ITC’s other businesses.

Investors have been excited about the possibility of a demerger so they have the option of staying with ITC’s high-returns businesses, without having to necessarily stay with a business that yields sub-optimal returns."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

We believe demerger of Hotel business is positive for unlocking shareholder value as 1) it solves capital allocation issue (given hotels business has seen capex of Rs75bn since it was merged into this entity) 2) de-merger will increase ROCE by 19ppt, as Hotels business has ROCE of just ~9.7% with 2.3% contribution to EBIT and 3) lower room additions in the past and low penetration makes outlook positive for medium term. Near to medium term outlook for hotel industry looks favourable with G20, revival in business & foreign tourist travel. Moreover, the new entity will continue to follow an asset light strategy for the business, while ITC will hold 40% stake and is open to further partnerships in the separated entity for long term.



Outlook

We believe strong growth momentum in cigarette business and steady margin expansion in FMCG are positives. ITC trades at 25.3x FY25 EPS with ROE/ROCE of 30%+/35%+ and ~80%+ dividend payout. We increase our SOTP based target price to Rs478 (Rs455 earlier, cigarette multiples increased to 22x). Retain ‘Accumulate’.

Only novel 'soft-shelled' ideas produce extraordinary returns, because the obvious ideas are already reflected in a stock's price. - Charles Ellis

One of the signs of trouble that market veterans keep an eye out for in a bull market, is of ignored stocks regaining favour with investors. That is an indication that the market may have run out of good ideas and is now willing to give a benefit of doubt to the stories it was not convinced about till a few months back. And that is now beginning to happen, they say. The good part is that such stories too have their day in the sun, before investors conclude that there are not enough stories available at a sensible price, even after accounting for a hefty growth premium.

Foreign funds were net sellers for the second successive day on Friday. Thursday’s huge negative figure was attributed to reversal of cash-futures arbitrage positions on expiry day. The street is unfazed by Friday’s net sales figure as well. The view is that mutual funds are sitting on enough cash, having sold shares when FIIs were on a buying spree since May. Should FIIs keep up with their selling, domestic funds would step in, say market players. Fundamentals, anyone?

What’s cooking?

Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) on Saturday reported a weak set of first quarter earnings. The numbers did not come as a surprise, given the hefty licence and maintenance charges it has been paying 63 Moons Technologies for extension of the contract for the trading platform. Net profit fell 52.7 percent even as the revenue for the quarter jumped around 34 percent year-on-year.

The net profit numbers are expected to worsen in the next couple of quarters, as MCX will be shelling out Rs 125 crore each quarter to 63 Moons,

compared to the Rs 87 crore it had paid for the June quarter. Licence and maintenance fees alone will work out to Rs 337 crore for this financial year, compared to the net profit of Rs 149 crore for the whole of last year.

Interestingly, the MCX stock has been resilient in the face of this massive a blow to its bottomline. The stock had corrected sharply in the trading session following the extension of the contract with 63 Moons. Since then, it has not just recouped the losses, but is trading higher than the levels pre-announcement of the deal. What could explain market enthusiasm for a stock that is not expected to report any meaningful profits for this year, and perhaps even a loss. There is chatter that MCX is in talks for a possible buyout by either NSE or BSE.

Market players say a deal with the NSE is highly unlikely because the bourse would then have a dominant position in both equities and commodities, something that won’t sit well with the Competition Commission of India (CCI). When asked for their comments, NSE denied that it was in talks with MCX, BSE declined to comment on market speculation and PS Reddy, CEO, MCX messaged: “It is not our policy to keep reacting to every rumour floated in the market. We will mind our business.”

A more straightforward explanation of the strength in MCX shares could be that investors are willing to look beyond the next few quarters of weak earnings, and instead focussing on the big picture story—that of MCX’s dominant market position in the commodity trading space, which does not appear to be under threat in the foreseeable future.

Benefits of under ownership

In December 2022, the Colgate India management met up with analysts and presented its game plan. Most of the analysts returned unenthused, terming the targets as too aggressive for a segment that was not growing fast enough. The stock drifted lower for a while, but since then has been climbing steadily, going on hit a record high on Friday. FMCG stocks, barring ITC, have not exactly been in the rage in 2023, but Colgate has quietly managed to tot up a 30 percent plus gain. The first quarter numbers announced last week were better than what most analysts had pencilled in. The company is slowing wresting back market share in the toothpaste segment, easing raw material prices have helped margins and there are signs of a recovery in the rural market as seen from the first quarter.

But analysts don’t seem convinced yet, and for two reasons. One, they are waiting to see if the first quarter number growth numbers can be sustained, and two, stock valuations are not exactly cheap. Citi has retained its 'sell' rating on the stock after the Q1 earnings, Motilal Oswal has a 'neutral' rating on the stock, Prabhudas Lilladher has a 'hold' while Sharekhan has upgraded its rating to 'hold'.

Most of the analysts raised earnings estimates for this year, but whether they want to hard sell the idea to fund managers is what will decide the rerating of the stock, which has been an underperformer for the last few years.

Analysts may be lukewarm to the stock, but the fact that most fund managers are underinvested in the stock appears to be working to Colgate’s advantage for now. The stock has rallied on heavy volumes despite cautious calls from analysts. As one of the market truisms go, the big profit from a stock call is not made by waiting till you see the proof of growth. And yet, it is hard to blame investors for not being adventurous enough, considering that growth has disappointed for the last many years. In a market where there are plenty of growth stories to choose from, investors can afford to be demanding in a few cases.

Street sees the red

Diagnostic stocks have been among the comeback stories of 2023, as concerns over the price war unleashed by recent entrants in the space appear to be fading. The worst seems to be behind for diagnostic stocks as investors appear to have made peace with the fact that the lusty growth numbers seen during the Covid phase were an aberration that could not have been sustained for long. Dr Lal Path shares have surged nearly 33 percent from the lows seen in February, raising hopes of a rerating. The price war may have abated, but pricing power is another matter.

Dr Lal Path Labs CEO Bharath Uppiliappan told CNBC-TV18 a few days back that competitive intensity remained high compared to pre-Covid levels, and that the company would hike prices only when input costs go up. He expects non-Covid volumes to pick up from the second half of this year. The outlook for the company is much better than what it was in 2022, but the question is if the market has already priced it in.

Kotak Institutional Equities analysts Alankar Garude, Samitinjoy Basak and Aniket Singh think so. “The increasing sanity in diagnostics pricing is well captured in the recovery built in our estimates,” the trio wrote in their earnings review note. “Despite recent moderation, pricing of incumbents such as Dr Lal Path Labs stays 2-3X higher than the cheapest organised alternative across cities, even for specialised and semi-specialised tests. While we have raised our margin assumptions post the 1QFY24 performance leading to a 4-6 percent raise in Dr Lal Path Labs FY2024-26E EPS, heightened marketing and tech investments could play spoilsport.”"

ITC’s proposed demerger of its hotel business has resulted in some uncertainty over how the new entity's capital expenditure will be funded.

Analysts say that the hotel business only accounted for four percent of the profitability while capital expenditure was around 20 percent. “Everyone was hopeful that if it gets demerged then the burden of capital expenditure on ITC would reduce,” says Sachin Bobade, Vice President - Consumer sector at Dolat Capital Market Ltd. “Now the main question is whether the capital expenditure of the new business will be funded by the new entity or ITC,” he adds.

ITC had announced in a regulatory filing on July 24 that its board had given initial approval for the separation of its hotel business via a scheme of arrangement. This restructuring plan is expected to allow the hotel division to operate independently in the fast-growing hospitality market, focusing on growth with an ideal capital structure.

“Ideally the company has enough cash position to take care of the capex which has already been announced,"" said an analyst requesting anonymity. The company can raise debt or equity going forward, he added.

The company has been implementing an 'asset-right' strategy for ITC Hotels, which ranks as the second largest publicly traded hotel chain. This approach aims to optimize capital use by reducing direct asset ownership, while increasing emphasis on management contracts or different partnership arrangements for the growth of the hotel business. Analysts suggest that through this method, ITC seeks to enhance its investment returns and minimize the risks related to substantial capital expenditure in the hotel industry.

Analysts say that after the separation ITC can put its money into the hotel business on a need and time basis, either through loans or other forms of investment. It would be seen as negative for the company depending on how much money ITC invests but ideally it would not invest more than it already has, they add.

It would be negative for the company if they extend huge financial support to the demerged company, says Shobit Singhal, research analyst at Anand Rathi Institutional Equities. “ITC has a 40 percent stake even after the demerger just to prevent any hostile takeover,” he adds.

As per the approved scheme, the majority ownership of the new firm, approximately 60 percent, will be directly held by the company's shareholders, with ITC Limited keeping about 40 percent.

The demerger not being a 100 percent vertical one as investors had expected is not necessarily a negative development, but capital allotment is something investors need to look out for, analysts say. The quantum and how much capex ITC provides for the hotel business will be the future metrics to assess, they say.

The aim of this strategic decision is to ensure ITC's ongoing commitment to the hospitality industry, offering long-term stability and support to the newly formed entity for rapid growth and consistent value generation. The company has scheduled an investor meeting on July 27 where they will discuss further details of the demerger. Analysts are likely to seek more clarity on the new entity's funding plans."

Everything else is noise. - Martin Whitman

Invest first and investigate later - that seems to be the mantra right now for investors zooming in on mid, small and micro-cap stocks. News flow in terms of order wins, corporate restructuring, deals and collaborations has been positive, but the stocks are now pricing in earnings that is likely to be seen two or three years out.

In the months following the Covid lows, rookie investors fared better than experienced players because the new entrants asked fewer questions and blindly bought into a rising market. But now it could be the turn of the battle-scarred veterans. Investors who have seen the mid and small-cap meltdown of 2000, 2008, and 2018 have turned cautious on the rally in second line shares. They are willing to let go of the potential 10-15 percent gains from these levels, only too aware of how it will all end.

The strategy of many of the HNIs/operators have been to hold on to the good names, gradually liquify positions in iffy stocks and veer that money into large-caps. With fund managers already slowing their purchases of mid and small-cap stocks, the support of smart money for these stocks is as good as over. But with the overall mood still upbeat, the large investors are now turning their attention to large-caps that have underperformed so far.

The more things change…

“It is a win-win situation for all shareholders, the timing of the amalgamation is particularly appropriate as the travel and tourism industry in India is poised for rapid growth,” former ITC chairman (late) YC Deveshwar had said back in August 2004, when ITC had merged its subsidiaries ITC Hotels and Ansal Hotels with itself. The market cheered the move briefly and investors moved on.

Cut to the present day: the hospitality sector is again in the midst of a major boom that looks to persist as the ITC board has given an in-principle nod

for the demerger of the hotels business. The market greeted the news by knocking the stock 4 percent lower as the re-rating story now appears to have climaxed. Besides, the contours of the proposed demerger are not exactly what the market had been looking forward to, though it partly addresses shareholders’ grouse of ITC not generating enough returns on the money it was pumping into the hotels business. But more importantly, the ITC story is now fully priced with its market capitilisation not too far from that of industry leader Hindustan Unilever. To argue for a valuation higher than HUL at this point looks to be a stretch.

View on the street is that hereon ITC is a compounding story and no longer a rerating story. In other words, gains will be steady than spectacular. The derating began in 2014-15 when the ESG (environment, society, governance) fad began to take hold and some FIIs started paring stake.

That no longer seems to be a concern, considering that FIIs have increased their holding in the stock by over 10 percentage points over the last six quarters. In market parlance, the stock is now ‘widely-owned’ by institutions.

What could drive the next round of re-rating, if at all. “Possibly the company announcing a demerger of some of its other businesses as well, like FMCG. But if the hotel demerger has been in the works for five years, it is anybody’s guess how long the next demerger could take,” a long time watcher of ITC said.

Rolling stocks

Shares of railway companies are on the move once again as order flows remain strong. Titagarh Rail’s top boss Umesh Chowdhury said his company’s quarterly revenues should stabilise around Rs 900 crore, going forward. Just a couple of years ago, it took the company two quarters to gross that much. Choudhary expects margin in the passenger train business to improve significantly, and the order pipeline to keep on building.

The street is hanging on to every word as it pushed it to a fresh record high on Monday. Domestic fund houses have so far been cautious on the rail story as they feel over-dependence on a single customer comes with a high risk. But foreign investors seem to be slowly warming up to the story. The Smallcap World fund recently picked up a 6 percent stake in Titagarh. The narrative for rail stocks in general is that the cycle has decisively turned for the railway sector.

But investors would do well to have a look at the long-term charts of railway companies going back 10-15 years. These companies have been the flavour of the season, but it was then followed by a long spell of brutal price correction. For instance, Titagarh shares plateaued in the 150-180 range between 2015 and 2017 and then corrected more than 70 percent over the next couple of years even before Covid struck.

A similar trend was seen in Texmaco as well, which is yet to regain its highs seen in 2015. There may be a compelling story in rail stocks right now, but investors should also realise that risks have also gone up significantly after the recent run-up. A lot will depend on how well the companies are able to execute and how fast they are paid.

Indus Towers

A group of HNIs led by the Silent Operator have piled on to Indus Towers over the last couple of months. Shares of the country’s largest mobile tower installation firm, whose fortunes are closely tied to that of Idea Vodafone, has been a underperformer for a while now, in line with Idea’s poor financial health.

With Kumar Birla having rejoined the board of Idea, a section of the market is betting on a fund infusion in Idea. The story is that if Idea does well, it will be able to repay its dues to Indus Towers. The longer-term picture for Indus Towers looks a bit hazy given that its business model is under threat from the new technology that will reduce reliance on mobile towers for expanding connectivity.

Old school players are betting that the transition could still be some way off, and there are gains to be made in the interim

The recession debate

The US economy may have surprised investors with its resilience to high interest rates, but a section of the market remains convinced that a recession cannot be ruled out entirely. JP Morgan AMC’s head of fixed income Jonathan Liang said in an interview to CNBC that he expects the US economy to tip into recession either by the end of 2023 or early 2024.

The main driver, according to Liang, would be the balance sheet problems at regional banks. These banks will need to first repair their balance sheets that took a blow during the banking crisis in March and this means credit costs could get tighter, hurting small businesses.

Liang may have a point. According to a WSJ report, regional banks are cutting back on lending as it eases the pressure on them to raise deposits in a high interest rate scenario. A smaller loan book also means lower capital requirements. These moves helped stabilised earnings in the quarter gone by, but they also have repercussions.

“This puts things like auto loans, home mortgages or commercial-real estate financing in banks’ crosshairs for cutting back. That could be felt by banks’ customers and ripple through the economy, affecting car dealers, home buyers or big-city office districts.”"

Tobacco-to-hotels conglomerate ITC briefly tipped HUL, India’s largest consumer company, as the leader in the stock markets on Monday, during intra-day trade. Moments later, the excitement over what was meant to be a shareholder-friendly move – the much anticipated de-merger of the hotels business - turned out to be a dampener. Has ITC peaked out?

ITC has been the subject of much criticism among investors as its stock severely underperformed between 2013 and 2020 while consumer companies flourished. However, since March 2020, the stock defied expectations by rising steadily, drawing attention from investors and analysts alike. As the stock price soared, more analysts turned bullish and more investors joined the bandwagon, propelling the stock even further.

Veteran value investors explain that such languishing periods are inherent in stock markets, and the sentiment often drives short and medium-term performances. However, in the long run, earnings hold the key to stock price movements. In the case of ITC, five factors have contributed to the recent turnaround.

First, the changing perception for cigarettes. For a decade, ITC faced erratic sales volumes in its cigarettes segment, leading to negative perceptions about its potential. Tax hikes too impacted sales. But ITC's volumes have rebounded remarkably in the past two years due to rational taxing that helped it regain the market share and stabilise profits.

Second, ITC's non-cigarettes FMCG business witnessed growing profitability, moving from negligible EBIT margins in FY17 to around 8 percent in FY23. Although lagging behind FMCG peers, this segment's improved profitability is contributing positively to ITC's overall performance now. These two were important fundamental factors that have forced investors to take ITC’s growth seriously.

There are two more market-related factors that too helped the stock. One is the fading away of the anti-ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) narrative and the comeback of value trades. Companies that showed resilience in earnings, irrespective of what businesses they were operating in, were preferred. Cash piles and cash flows were preferred over growth projections. Be it fossil fuel, or sin businesses, investors are now more focused on economic opportunities rather than strictly adhering to ESG standards.

Additionally, ITC's defensive characteristics made it an attractive choice for investors seeking stability amid uncertainties in the market. The company's predictable revenue and profit growth, bolstered by robust cigarette volumes, add to its appeal as a defensive stock.

Amid all this, the management is also raising the pitch on being shareholder friendly. One of those measures that was talked about was the de-merger of the cash-guzzling hotels business, which was announced finally on July 25. Markets would have liked a vertical split, so the hotels business was completely out of ITC’s books and there would be no ambiguity over future capital allocations, or about lower return on invested capital.

But the management has chosen to retain a 40 percent stake. The only way this can be justified is if the management sells this stake to a strategic investor at a higher price at a later stage, but it complicates the matter anyway. If the remaining stake is sold, the new strategic investor would have to shell out more by making an additional open offer which will make it costlier. That being the case, the sell-out option could have been exercised at any time including now when the hotels business is on a high.

Either way, the most ambitious analyst estimate for the hotel business is not more than Rs 23 per share. The stock closed 4 percent down, losing Rs 21 on July 24. The deal is done, dusted and impact digested in the stock price.

Now what? All the triggers for ITC’s re-rating have played out. The stock still appears undervalued compared to other consumer companies. Its P/E ratio of 31 times trailing earnings versus 60 times for HUL. Nonetheless, ITC's heavy reliance on tobacco, which contributes 75 percent of its overall EBIT, despite representing only 37 percent of revenue, remains a concern.

The perception of cigarettes being a declining business which will always face the wrath of the government will prevent investors from valuing the business highly despite its superb economics. Cigarettes requires absolutely no capital – around 800 percent return on capital - and thus the entire cash flows of cigarettes can be utilised to create new businesses that will have lower profitability but higher longevity.

If the ITC management enhances the return ratios of its consumer businesses – current the FMCG business produces a return on capital of 15 percent - investors can easily justify a higher multiple for ITC from current levels, not equal to what other multinationals command though.

For now, ITC's near and medium-term earnings story looks promising. Besides, the company's strong dividend yield, close to 3 percent, provides some cushion."

The demerger of the hotels business of ITC Limited into a separate entity will boost the capital efficiency ratios of the diversified conglomerate, equity analysts said on Monday. ITC announced that the board of the company has accorded in-principle approval to demerge the hotel business into a new entity to be listed pursuant to a scheme of arrangement.

""It is a great demerger. It will boost the return on capital of ITC and its capital efficiency ratios will go up by almost 20 percentage points,” IIFL analyst Nemkumar said. Under the scheme of arrangement, ITC will hold 40 per cent of the new entity and the balance will be held directly by the company’s shareholders proportionate to their holdings.

""The demerger process will take around nine to 12 months and every shareholder of ITC holding 100 shares will get 60 scrips of the new entity,” Nemkumar said. The market was of course expecting the demerger, he added. Another analyst said that the demerger process will unlock the value for the shareholders by giving them a direct stake in the new entity and help in a sharper capital allocation policy as outlined in the asset-right strategy of 'ITC Next’.

""With ITC holding 40 per cent in the demerged hotels business, it will provide stability to the new entity while continuing with the focused vision to improve margins, profitability and competitiveness of the company’s businesses. The reorganisation is a sensible approach that will provide long-term stability and allow the company to have a continuing strategic interest to leverage synergies for its fast-growing foods business,” another analyst said on condition of anonymity.

This move also demonstrates the intent of its chairman Sanjiv Puri’s 'ITC Next’ strategy, which redefines investments for future growth with sharper capital allocation policy, and better profitability while at the same time providing structural advantages to enhance competitiveness, company officials said. Brokerage firm Sharekhan said that post-demerger of the hotels business, the return profile of ITC will improve substantially in the coming years. ""The improving margins in the non-cigarette FMCG businesses will also add to the improvement in return ratios and valuation multiples of ITC Limited”.

The demerger of the hotels business will also bring a large focus on the growth of the company's cigarette and FMCG businesses to generate high cash flows, it said. The ITC scrip closed at Rs 469.35 on the NSE on Monday, registering a fall of 4.30 per cent."

Emkay Global Financial's research report on ITC

From the core cigarette business perspective, we expect rational tax hikes ahead, given higher share of the ad-valorem component leading to build-up of volumes, which along with improving mix would aid a high-single-digit EBIT growth. In non-cigarette operations, we continue to see profitable growth and improving return profile, where segments are self-sufficient to address their growth needs. Amid the enhanced demand setting in F&B, Agri export and Paper, we see execution to be key. We continue to see ahead-of-time capex as a business moat, which enhances the company’s structural prospects. Value unlocking in Hotels operations remains a near-term catalyst.

Outlook

We maintain our BUY recommendation on ITC with Jun-24E target price of Rs525/share, as we see firm structural prospects.

New Delhi, Jul 11 Diversified conglomerate ITC's FMCG business has recorded a 21 per cent rise in annual consumer spend to nearly Rs 29,000 crore in 2022-23, according to the latest annual report of the company.

ITC operates in the FMCG space with 25 home-grown brands.

The company measures annual consumer spend as the sum total of what the consumer spends on buying the goods of the company. It is the net sales turnover of the brands along with channel margins and taxes.

""Your company's vibrant portfolio of over 25 world-class Indian brands, largely built through an organic growth strategy in a relatively short period of time, represents an annual consumer spend of nearly Rs 29,000 crore and reaches over 230 million households in India,"" ITC said addressing its shareholders in the report.

This is around 21 per cent higher than the financial year 2021-22. In the last annual report, ITC said its FMCG business had an annual consumer spend of over Rs 24,000 crore.

In terms of distribution reach, ITC said in FY23 its products reached 230 million households, up from over 200 million households in FY22.

In FY 2022-23, gross revenue from the sale of products and services stood at Rs 69,480.89 crore, in which its cigarettes business contributed Rs 28,206.83 crore and FMCG business was at Rs 19,122.50 crore.

Its ITC e-Store, a D2C platform, is now operational in 24,000+ pin codes and continues to receive excellent consumer response.

The company operates in the food space with brands such as Aashirvaad, Bingo, Sunfeast, and YiPPee, while in the personal care, it has brands such as Fiama, Vivel, Savlon etc.

ITC is well poised to address value-added adjacencies and categories of the future by leveraging the 25 powerful mother brands it has established over the years.

""Recent examples of such brand extensions include Aashirvaad to Dairy, Ready-to-Eat, Vermicelli, Salt and Spices; Sunfeast to Dairy Beverages and Cakes; Bingo to Namkeens; ITC Master Chef to Frozen Snacks and Cooking pastes; Classmate to Writing instruments; Savlon to Sanitisers, Wipes and Disinfectant sprays etc,"" it said.

Besides the domestic market, ITC FMCG business also continues to expand its export footprint, with a reach now spanning over 60 countries.

In personal care, the company witnessed a surge in inflation, which led to moderation in demand, especially in rural markets. However, progressive improvement was witnessed during the course of the year, said ITC.

""Portfolio premiumisation, the launch of an innovative and differentiated range of products and agility in mitigating the impact of commodity inflation enabled the business to strengthen the core and grow emerging categories during the year, in spite of a challenging operating environment,"" it said.

ITC has invested in modern ICMLs near major demand centers to improve product freshness, market responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the automated AMLFs in Pudukkottai and Kapurthala offer inventory optimization and operational efficiency, contributing to overall cost reduction and improved market servicing.

At the Kapurthala ICML plant, direct buying of wheat offers substantial benefits to farmers including transparency in grading, weight and pricing, other than delayering operations and enhancing sourcing & logistics efficiencies. This initiative is being scaled up through focused crop development in the area to upgrade crop quality.

Earlier, ITC chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri had said that the demerger of the conglomerate's hotel business is “very much on the table” after the sector recovered after Covid-19.

Recently, foreign broking firm Jefferies raised ITC's target price to Rs 530 from Rs 520 on shift to asset-right strategy for hotels.

""ITC Hotels is the second largest listed chain. We apply 18x EV/Ebitda multiple pegging at a discount to our fair value for the leader, Indian Hotels at 23x. Accordingly, we raise ITC's target price,"" said Jefferies in a report dated June 27.

The hotel business has contributed less than 5 percent to ITC's revenues and EBIT over the last decade. Meanwhile, it has accounted for over 20 percent of ITC's capex in the past. Investors have always been concerned as this guzzling of cash has not generated good returns.

But the conglomerate is slowly turning things around. ""ITC has been increasingly focusing on an asset-light strategy and today, slightly over half of the room inventory is through management contracts, while the rest comes from owned hotels,"" the report said.

In the quarter ended March 2023, ITC Limited reported a 21.4 percent on-year growth in standalone net profit at Rs 5,086.9 crore for the March quarter. Its revenue from operations (excluding excise duty) also increased 5.6 percent to Rs 16,398 crore, exceeding estimates of various analysts. Hotels business revenue for the quarter doubled to Rs 781 crore.

Foreign broking firm Jefferies has raised its target price for ITC to Rs 530 from Rs 520, indicating a 19 percent upside from current levels. The upgrade comes on the back of ITC considering an alternate structure for the hotel business.

""ITC Hotels is the second largest listed chain which has been focusing on an 'asset-right' strategy. We apply 18x EV/Ebitda multiple pegging at a discount to our fair value for the leader, Indian Hotels at 23x. Accordingly, we raise ITC's target price,"" said Jefferies in a report dated June 27.

The hotel business has contributed less than 5 percent to ITC's revenues and EBIT over the last decade. Meanwhile, it has accounted for over 20 percent of ITC's capex in the past. Investors have always been concerned as this guzzling of cash has not generated good returns.

The hotel business' RoCE (return on capital employed) has also been in single digits for most years. The hotels business has seen high volatility with 15-year revenue CAGR of only 6 percent, Jefferies noted.

But the conglomerate is slowly turning things around. ""ITC has been increasingly focusing on an asset-light strategy and today, slightly over half of the room inventory is through management contracts, while the rest

comes from owned hotels,"" the report said.

A management contract is essentially a contractual arrangement for the management of a part or whole of an entity.

The premium ITC Hotels are entirely owned while 'Fortune' and 'WelcomHeritage' are under management contracts. In fact, 50 percent of rooms added in the last three years in the standalone entity have been through management contracts.

ITC Hotels CEO Anil Chadha has also said that the plan to add 20 new hotels in the next two years will be dominated by these contracts. ITC also plans to enter the Middle East market for adding new hotel properties.

""As profitability improves in the hotels business, we shift to EV/Ebitda valuation for the hotel business versus EV/Invested capital earlier. Thus, we raise the target price,"" Jefferies said.

At 11 am, ITC stock was quoting at Rs 447 on the NSE, about 0.4 percent higher than the previous close. The stock has gained 34 percent in 2023 so far.

As markets flirt with all-time high levels, the Nifty FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) index has also been on a roll.

The index hit its peak of 52,540.50 on June 16 and is now 2 percent below that level. Since March, the index has rallied almost 18 percent. Heavyweights ITC, Hindustan Unilever and Britannia have also gained close to 15 percent. ITC, which commands over 30 percent weightage in the index, has contributed to most of this rally.

But now, technical indicators suggest that the rally is done and dusted. ""At the current juncture, the index has given a bearish divergence pattern in the weekly time frame. Weakness is possible till 48,000 if it fails to hold 50,500. Currently, it has huge resistance around 52,500,"" technical analyst Dinesh Nagpal told Moneycontrol.

On the higher side, the index may fail to sustain above 52,500 levels. ""Many components of the index are in the overbought zone, including Britannia and ITC. Only a decisive move beyond 52,500 will have bullish medium-term implications,"" believes Anuj Dixit, Executive VP- Equity Research, Sovereign Global said.

Not just technical levels, fundamental factors too are not working in favour of the consumer pack. Here's why:

Price growth tapers off

FMCG companies clocked double-digit sales growth in FY23 as they hiked prices to mitigate the rising cost of raw materials, especially palm oil. Volume growth took a backseat as price hikes helped FMCG companies protect their topline.

Now, raw material prices have tapered off. Palm oil prices are down over 20 percent from the highs hit after the Ukraine-Russia war. According to Elara Capital, palm oil comprises 10 percent of HUL's raw material cost, 23 percent of Godrej Consumer's and 16 percent of Britannia.

This means margin comfort is here but price-led benefits will fade. ""The FMCG sector seems well poised in H1 FY24 with raw material cost tailwind. However, in H2 FY24 we expect revenue growth to moderate as pricing benefits should fade and growth would have to be volume-led,"" according to Kunal Vora, Head - India Equity Research.

Moreover, mature categories like hair oil and oral care have seen only 3-4 percent revenue CAGR over the last 7 years.

Can volume growth show the way?

Over the past few years, rural volume growth has remained elusive for FMCG companies. Premiumisation and urban markets have led the way. Going forward, the picture for rural volumes does not look too bright.

""Commentary on rural remains underwhelming, and pick-up

may take time, with El Niño also posing a threat in the short term,"" according to Jefferies.

The FMCG market (urban and rural) registered flat volume growth in the March quarter, as per Nielsen data. In a Q4 earnings concall, Hindustan Unilever's managing director and chief executive officer Sanjiv Mehta said that the overall FMCG market's volume growth should be 4-5 percent while commodity prices remain steady, only then the volatile scenario can turn a corner.

The risk of El Nino

When it comes to the impact of El Nino, surveys conducted by different brokerages suggest different results. For instance, ICICI Securities did an empirical study of 4 decades of monsoon patterns and came to the conclusion that discretionary demand (car and especially tractors) is more linked to rainfall than agri and consumer staples.

According to economists, an intense El Nino that severely disrupts the monsoon could push inflation up by 15-20 basis points by boosting food prices. A slight delay in monsoon has already pushed Kharif sowing by 10 to 15 days, as per Skymet.

In this regard, it is important to monitor the management commentary of FMCG companies after Q1 FY24 earnings.

Ye dil maange more - That's what foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are saying to Pepsi bottler Varun Beverages. They don't want Pepsi; they want the shares. From 19.82 percent in March 2020, FII stake in this consumer stock increased to 26 percent by the end of March 2023.

According to a Moneycontrol analysis of the top 10 consumer companies by market capitalisation, FIIs have increased stakes in seven. The biggest jump has come in Varun Beverages, Britannia, and Tata Consumer Products.

For Varun Beverages, the optimism largely comes from the company expanding its high-margin businesses. One example is Sting. The energy drink Sting has been positioned at a favourable price point, attracting the masses.

Due to the higher mix of Sting, the company's net realisation per case came in at Rs 174 for Q1 CY23, up 10 percent year-on-year (YoY). Sting, along with other energy drinks, will soon be 15 percent of the portfolio, said Chairman Ravi Jaipuria in the latest earnings concall.

""VBL has seen 15 percent organic volume growth in the last three years, led by distribution expansion in underpenetrated territories and new launches (Sting, milk-based beverages, etc.),"" according to ICICI Securities.

For Britannia, FIIs seem to have taken heart from the fact that the Good-Day biscuit maker managed to defend its margins during the pandemic. While the operating margins of most FMCG companies slumped due to high raw material prices, Britannia's remained consistent at 16-17 percent over the past three years.

Morgan Stanley, which has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, with a target price of Rs 5,300, said Britannia's March quarter beat on estimates was entirely margin-led. The management’s focus is to build for the next 100 years, unlike investors who may overemphasise short-term margins, it added.

Moreover, consumer preference is towards large, trusted, and organised brands in times of hyperinflation.

""Investors with long-term bias and patience are likely to be rewarded as formalisation will be more visible in the food space, given a higher share of the unorganised sector, who are themselves grappling with supply chain challenges,"" according to analysts at Philip Capital.

Tata Consumer Products, too, saw a jump in FII stake over the past three years ― from 18.15 percent in March 2020 to 25.04 percent in March 2023. During this period, the stock gained over 150 percent.

While the company's international coffee business was reeling under inflationary pressure, its India food business held fort. The India business has a higher margin, especially the branded business at around 14 per cent and international business at 11 per cent.

Recently, the company's Chairman N Chandrasekaran said that they are open to acquisitions and expanding into new categories. ""India’s business growth would continue to outpace that of the international market, with the percentage of revenue from the Indian market expected to increase,"" he said.

What about ITC?

FII stake in retail favourite ITC has remained steady at about 14 percent, despite the 150 percent rally in the stock price over the past three years. While the company is firing on all cylinders ― cigarettes, FMCG, and hotels, the perception of a 'sin stock' is hard to shake off. That said, FIIs' stake in the company is at a historically high level.

When asked what made him most happy about investing, legendary investor the late Rakesh Jhunjhunwala had once replied in jest, ‘When the dividends come in June’.

Most retail investors though when buying stocks focus more on capital appreciation than the potential of sustained dividend. That is why they should pay special attention to brokerage CLSA’s latest edition of Bits and Pieces by Damian Kestel.

In its weekly newsletter, the foreign broking firm reiterates that dividends make a significant contribution to total return over time. The classic example that it cites is Warren Buffett’s dividend bonanza over the years from Coca-Cola.

In 1994, Berkshire Hathaway received $75 million cash dividend from Coke. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million. Given the total cost of purchase was $1.3 billion, the dividend yield comes to ~50 percent for 2022.

Noting this, CLSA calculated what the yield in 2023 would be on some Asia Pacific large caps if an investor was lucky enough to buy at a 15-year low and receive a 2023 dividend.

In the past ten years, the MSCI Asia Pacific index is up 18.8 percent in price. ""But, if dividends were re-invested then the index would have been 57 percent higher,"" according to the latest Bits & Pieces report.

Among names like Samsung, TSMC and Macquarie, India's Tata Consultancy Services and ITC find a spot in CLSA's list.

If an investor had purchased TCS stock at a 15-year low of Rs 103.5, he/she would stand to receive Rs 124 in dividend, indicating a yield of a whopping 120 percent.

Similarly, ITC fetches a yield of 36 percent on its 15-year low price which, in Kestel's words, is ""not bad for a sin stock"". ITC's dividend per share keeps rising under an improved capital allocation policy, which offers good support to the stock, according to the broking firm.

Another Indian stock that catches CLSA's eye is PowerGrid. The company raised its dividend by 26 percent year-on-year to Rs 14.75 in FY23. Moreover, it also said in an analyst call that it does not intend to hoard cash which only means consistent dividend growth in coming years.

Though Vedanta is one of the highest dividend-paying stocks in India, CLSA highlighted in its report that it is more to do with cash requirement at the parent level to pay off debt rather than rewarding investors.

The bottom line: a dividend is a gift that keeps on giving. ""Financial magic can occur when you invest in a company with a policy (and the operational means) of increasing its dividends and then go to the beach,"" writes Kestel.

Shares of tobacco-to-hospitality conglomerate ITC continued to build on the previous session’s gains and edged up 1.3 percent in morning trade on May 30 – the record date for its FY23 dividend.

CMD Sanjiv Puri on May 29 told The Hindu that the company’s plan to demerge its hotels business, which had been put on hold due to the Covid pandemic, was likely to be revived this year and taken forward in line with the industry recovery. He also hinted at the possibility of the Infotech business being spun off, but said the timing would be the crucial element.

Earlier this month, ITC Limited reported a 21.4 percent on-year growth in standalone net profit at Rs 5,086.9 crore for the March quarter. Its revenue from operations (excluding excise duty) also increased 5.6 percent to Rs 16,398 crore, exceeding estimates of various analysts.

On May 30, ITC declared a final dividend of Rs 6.75 per share and a special dividend of Rs 2.75 per share of Re 1 each for the quarter ended March 2023.

The conglomerate had previously declared an interim dividend of Rs 6 in February 2023. The total dividend for the financial year ended March 31, 2023, amounts to Rs 15.50 per ordinary share of Re 1 each. The dividend shall be paid to entitled shareholders on or before August 17.

Head-to-Head: HUL and ITC stake equal claims to India's FMCG crown

The positive financial results and the announcement of dividends have boosted sentiment for the stock, brokers said. The company's diverse business segments, which include cigarettes, FMCG products, hotels, and agri-business, have continued to perform well, contributing to its overall growth.

ITC shares hit a record high of Rs 451.75 on Monday, before closing at Rs 449.10. The stock was trading at Rs 445.55 at 10.55 am on Tuesday.

The maxim ‘form is temporary; class is permanent’ would be an apt description for India’s largest FMCG firm – Hindustan Unilever. Despite a muted Q4 show amid lingering inflationary headwinds, the analyst community’s love affair with the market heavyweight has only increased.

Its more diversified peer ITC, on the other hand, posted stellar numbers, propelled by both cigarettes and staples. With more earnings visibility than its peers, ITC remains firmly ensconced at the top of market participants’ buy lists.

But is there a case for choosing one over the other? Or does the ideal portfolio need the twin engines of both ITC and HUL? Here’s how these two stalwarts stack up -

Financials: HUL’s Q4 numbers were marginally below expectations on most fronts, but it was the volume growth of just 4 percent which disappointed the Street. In fact, the 3 percent contraction in rural volumes accentuated the underlying pain points in the economy. Most analysts expect the trend to continue in the coming quarters.

""We remain cautiously optimistic, expecting mid-single-digit volume growth as the near-term operating environment continues to be challenging. Considering price cuts and increased royalty rate at 3.45 percent, we trimmed our earnings and retain 'ADD' rating,"" Centrum Broking said.

No such problems for ITC, whose FMCG business posted impressive figures on both growth and profitability fronts. Cigarette volumes shot up 12 percent YoY, helped also by clawback from illicit trade, while the hotels segment was lifted by the post-Covid revival in travel, which offset the weakness in paperboard and agribusinesses.

""Unlike its staples peers, ITC has reported consistently impressive performance in its Other FMCG business (19 percent revenue growth and margin improvement despite elevated raw material costs), along with robust performance in Hotels. ITC’s earnings visibility remains better than peers,"" analysts at Motilal Oswal said.

Market Moves: ITC shares have been hogging the limelight since the past year, and have emerged as the top Nifty gainer. HUL’s performance has been sedate in comparison. But a bit of context may be useful here -- HUL edges past ITC when it comes to their five-year returns.

Analyst Views: Very little to choose between the two, as both companies feature prominently on ‘buy’ lists. With zero ‘sell’ calls, ITC has a near-perfect score on the sentiment meter, though HUL has reasserted its position with an increase in ‘buy’ ratings post the Q4 results.

Valuations: HUL has traditionally commanded a higher price multiple than ITC, in line with most consumer staple firms. At a 1-year forward P/E of 52.69, HUL is trading well above its 10-year average of 46.5x.

ITC’s price multiple of 25.4x too is above its 10-year average of 22.16. Incidentally, ITC has among the lowest P/E ratios in the Nifty FMCG index, mainly due to the tax overhang on cigarettes, though the situation may be turning favourable for the company.

“The key challenges for ITC – an extremely punitive tax regime of the past, Covid-related disruption and commodity cost inflation – now seem to be receding,” according to Motilal Oswal.

However, analysts said the ITC stock’s recent run-up limits its further rerating potential, which means the P/E gap with HUL is expected to remain in the medium term.

The two finalists leading the race to buy Mumbai-based Capital Foods are giants Nestle India Ltd, the Indian subsidiary of Swiss multinational Nestle SA, and ITC Ltd, reported Mint. The winner of the race could shell out anywhere between Rs 4,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore in a deal to acquire the maker of Ching’s Secret and Smith & Jones food ingredients, the report quoted sources as saying.

“Nestle’s bid is the highest. ITC’s bid is very close to that,"" according to a source who is in the know of the deal.

Nestle SA has been in talks with Capital Foods for a deal for the last few months, and the number floating around was around $1 billion. But they weren't the only suitors as Capital Foods, one of India’s largest culinary food ingredient maker, also saw interest from Kraft Heinz, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Tata Consumer Products, and ITC.

Also Read: Nestle eyes $1 billion deal for ‘Ching’s Secret’ owner Capital Foods in India

A Nestle India spokesperson did not want to verify the potential deal, stating, “We do not comment on rumours and speculations. We do not comment on market speculation.""

The bids

A source in the know said ITC has put in a bit around the Rs 4,000 crore mark, while Nestle values Capital Foods a bit higher between Rs 4,000 crore and Rs 5,000 crore. The deal is in the final stage and the source says an acquisition is likely to be announced within a month.

Nestle India's portfolio in the country includes products in food, beverages, chocolate, and confectioneries. Its most popular brand is Maggi, which sells seasonings, instant soups, and much-loved noodles. The company has over 60 percent market share of India’s Rs 11,600-crore instant noodles segment.

The deal, if concluded, may be one of the largest buyouts of a homegrown consumer brand in the food space.

Should Nestle clinch the deal, it will give the company an immediate entry into the fast-growing Chinese food ingredient space, where it currently lags.

Ching’s Secret makes chutneys, instant soups, Chinese masalas, Chinese sauces, hakka noodles and flavoured noodles, catering to the demand for so-called ‘Indian Chinese’ food products. Meanwhile, Smith & Jones makes pasta masala, pizza ketchup and cooking pastes.

According to an analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity, Capital Foods likely clocked FY23 revenue of around Rs 840 crore, and at a deal size of Rs 4,000-5,000 crore, it will be valued at 4.5-5 times its earnings. The company currently has a revenue run rate of Rs 1,000 crore, the source added.

Should ITC win the race, it will expand its presence in the consumer goods and ready-to-cook food ingredients space.

ITC’s food offerings include Aashirvaad multi-grain atta, Farmlite range of biscuits, Sunfeast protein shake, and Nutrilite B Natural beverages, among many others."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

Cigarette volume growth for 4Q was 12% supported by broad based premiumisation in longs and king size cigarettes. Near term looks favourable with expectations of mid-single digit volume growth. Although FMCG margins got a boost due to PLI and state incentives, FY24 should gain from benign input costs. Hotel outlook is positive due to G20 & revival in business and foreign tourist travel. Paper & Paperboard segment was impacted due to weakness in market coupled with expansion related shutdowns, expect margins to recover from 4Q levels. While near term outlook is strong, we estimate 10.7% EPS CAGR over FY23- 25. ITC has scope to increase cigarette profitability as current EBIDTA margins are 5ppt lower than peak margins. ITC trades at 22.8x FY25 EPS with ROE/ROCE of 30%+/35%+ and ~80%+ dividend payout. Retain Accumulate.

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

ITC’s Q4FY2023 performance was ahead of our expectation, largely on account of better-than-expected OPM at 38% (expanded 423bps y-o-y), while net revenue came in-line with expectation at Rs. 16,398 crore.

Despite strong run-up in ITC’s stock price in recent times, valuations at 24x/21x its FY2024E/FY2025E EPS look attractive in the backdrop consistent earnings growth visibility and good dividend payout (dividend yield of 3.7%). We maintain our Buy rating with a revised PT of Rs. 485.

ITC - 19 -05 - 2023 - khan"
"May 20, 2023 06:55 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mc-long-view-itc-will-the-momentum-continue-10625511.html,"Currently, trading at Rs 417, the stock commands a market-cap of Rs 5.17 trillion.

It has been the most damned stock for the last few years, but last month the stock hit Rs 400 attracting an unfair share of attention. No other stock in recent memory has been so talked about on crossing a psychological mark, which, by the way, is of little significance to investors. But then, ITC has been a subject of much ridicule as the stock underperformed miserably over the past few years when the rest of consumer companies were going through the roof notwithstanding their already high valuations. ITC was trading at around Rs 340 in July 2017, tanked all the way to 160 in March 2020 (laid low by Covid), and this year it scaled past its 2017 peak to cross Rs 400 levels in April. Currently, trading at Rs 417, the stock commands a market-cap of Rs 5.17 trillion.

What has really changed for the tobacco-to-hotels conglomerate?

If you ask ardent value investors, they’ll tell you that this is simply in the nature of stock markets, that stocks can languish for a long time before they catch the market’s fancy. Perception plays a big role in performance over the short and medium term, but in the end, earnings are the key driver of stock prices and sooner or later, if the earnings story remains intact, the stock price will catch up.

ITC’s underperformance for the longest time and its sudden surge is a blend of both perception and reality. There are at least five factors that have contributed to the turn. And the Q4 numbers announced yesterday only support the change in sentiment. ITC’s Q4 numbers beat analyst expectations on all counts: it reported a 21.4 percent year-on-year growth in standalone net profit at Rs 5,086 crore, much higher than the analyst expectation of Rs 4764 crore, revenue went up 5.6 percent to Rs 16,398 crore, against an expectation of Rs 16,152 crore. Even more, Ebitda margin showed an impressive up move at 37.9 percent, up from 33.6 percent in the year-ago period. Most analysts have re-iterated their ‘buy’ on the stock.

But let’s get back to the larger triggers beyond the recent numbers that are powering the rally in ITC.

First, the growth perception for cigarettes has changed decisively. If you look at the sales volume in cigarettes, it has been quite erratic over the past decade. Till FY20-21, cigarette volumes either showed negative or lower single digit growth (see chart). Obviously, if volumes are so erratic in a segment that is your biggest driver of profits, who is going to touch the stock?

Cigarettes contributed 68 percent to ITC’s revenue in FY13, which had come down to 60% by FY17 and 40% in FY22. It’s contribution to EBIT has also come down from 86 percent in FY17 to 78 percent in FY18. But why was the volume declining? For two main reasons. One, the government was continuously increasing the duty on cigarettes, which was eating into sales. Second, of course, Covid had an impact on sales because lockdowns meant that pan shops were shut, and availability was a problem. All outdoor businesses were affected and so were cigarette sales.

These two domestic factors only cemented the already-negative perception around tobacco companies world over, as smoking rates have been on a continuous decline due to health concerns, tighter regulations, and companies having to perennially fight litigations, especially in the US. Litigations are not a problem in India, but the negative perception has been building.

But over the past two years, ITC’s volumes have been robust. In FY21-22, cigarette volumes were up 17 percent, and in FY23 the volume is estimated to have grown 18 percent. One of the reasons for this volume comeback is that taxes have not increased much. In fact, once GST was introduced and cigarettes were kept out of it, there was a fear that the government would meddle with taxes too much and cigarette volumes would go for a toss again. But that did not happen. Instead, the reverse happened.

The rational taxes helped ITC gain market-share. First, it helped the company take away share from the unorganised segment — some of the beedi smokers now smoke cigarettes. Second, cigarette smuggling has been coming down, helping sales further.

Higher volume has obviously helped the company clock robust growth in profits. Now, will this trend continue?

The thing is that smokers will continue to smoke and pay more for their cigarettes as long as they don’t feel that they are paying double the money for half a puff. A modest price increase below the general inflation level is very much acceptable because smokers are addicted anyway. So modest price increases are okay. Volumes tend to take a hit only if taxes are increased too much.

A lot of market participants now believe that the company has productively engaged with the government to impress upon them that taxes should be kept under check because as long as sales are robust, the government can earn better in terms of tax revenues as well. By hiking taxes on cigarettes, they only end up encouraging beedi sales and cigarette smuggling, neither of which contribute to the tax kitty.

Thus, if tax increases are modest, then cigarette sales should be steady, which lends stability to ITC’s overall growth, although there is no argument about the fact that tobacco is a declining business in the long run.

That’s about cigarette sales.

Second reason for the comeback is the company’s growing profitability in its non-cigarettes FMCG business. In FY17 EBIT margin for this segment was negligible (0.25%) and that has now moved to about 7.19%. It’s still way behind its FMCG peers but there is at least some semblance of profitability emerging here.

Now, the third reason for the stock to be back in favour is the fact that the anti-ESG trade around the world is now fading. In fact, it is as good as over. Over the last few years, if a company was into a business that was environment-unfriendly, like fossil fuels, or in socially undesirable businesses like tobacco, investors would be hesitant to touch them.

Fact is, while as a concept ESG is a noble idea, there was never any altruistic motive behind ESG investing. Here is why: if governments perceive that certain businesses or practices are undesirable, they will levy additional taxes and punish them economically or make life difficult for them in terms of regulations. So, from an investment standpoint ESG essentially means a tax on the future which will hit cash flows and profitability.

But post-Covid supply disruptions have thrown this theory out of the window. The markets do not care about ESG anymore, because markets are greedy, and they will go wherever there is money. Since they saw oil and coal prices go up, they latched on to those stocks once again. Ditto for tobacco. This fading of the ESG narrative has actually helped bring some of the unloved businesses back in favour, and ITC is one such.

Even more, news that some high-profile investors are buying into the stock creates its own momentum. For instance, last quarter’s shareholding pattern showed that Rajiv Jain of GQG Partners, who was in the news recently for buying into Adani stocks, has picked up a stake in ITC. Now, in investing be it individuals or institutions herding is quite common and as the stock gains traction it will attract more institutions.

A fourth reason is that ITC is still seen as a good defensive play. When investors want some kind of defensive positioning in their portfolio when markets look uncertain, where do they go? They load up on a stock like ITC. The fact that it is not over-owned makes it less vulnerable to any kind of drawdown. It is a consumer company where revenue and profit growth look kind of predictable now, especially as the cigarette volume story looks good.

Yet another trigger for the stock could be the de-merger of the hotels business. Hotels is a business with low return ratios and is a drag on overall ROE. The management has said it will de-merge the business, and if it does, the stock could see another round of re-rating. Not counting that, even if the company refrains from deploying incremental capital into the hotels business and takes on management contracts, as it has committed already, and keeps its balance sheet asset-light, the financial complexion will still aid the stock.

Even as the narrative turns overwhelmingly positive for ITC, it continues to be super cheap compared to other consumer companies. A P/E of 28 times trailing versus 55-80 for rivals in the consumer space — the gap is substantial, leaving room for further re-rating.

But despite the recent optimism, ITC cannot be compared to a consumer company. Currently, 37% percent of ITC’s revenue comes from tobacco, but it contributes more than 75% percent to its overall EBIT because it enjoys a margin of 63 percent. Thought the growth pangs seem over for now, it is not perceived as business that has great potential for high growth over a long period, and increasingly regulators will only look to penalise such companies. On the other hand, the rest of the businesses which contribute 63 percent of the revenues have a 11 percent margin and contribute 23 percent to profits.

Of course, as noted earlier the non-cigarette FMCG business is showing growth in profitability, which is a surely a positive. Still, the irony of ITC is that the business which enjoys superlative margins and constitutes the bulk of its profits is perceived to be a shrinking business, while the fast-growing business rivalling Levers and Britannia suffers from inferior margins and return ratios.

Still, ITC is really not a bad bet at 28 times earnings. The stock has already jumped 150 percent since the Covid lows. But be under no illusion: at the end of the day ITC is primarily a tobacco company, because that is what still brings the bulk of its profits. Thus, the valuation gap between ITC and other FMCG companies is unlikely to be bridged fully.

On the flip side, the company pays good dividends — yield is currently around 3 percent, the tobacco growth story is looking good for now, which means the near and medium-term earnings story is on track, and the sentiment has now turned in its favour. Markets have a tendency to overshoot at both ends, so it is unlikely this momentum will fade soon."

Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post March quarter earnings:

Prabhudas Lilladher

Broking house increase FY24/FY25 EPS by 1.6%/1.4% and target price to Rs 455 (Rs 444 earlier) as it rolls over to FY25. Cigarette volume growth for 4Q was 12% supported by broad based premiumisation in longs and king size cigarettes.

Near term looks favourable with expectations of mid-single digit volume growth. Although FMCG margins got a boost due to PLI and state incentives, FY24 should gain from benign input costs. Hotel outlook is positive due to G20 & revival in business and foreign tourist travel.

Paper & Paperboard segment was impacted due to weakness in market coupled with expansion related shutdowns, expect margins to recover from 4Q levels.

While near term outlook is strong, it estimates 10.7% EPS CAGR over FY23-25. ITC has scope to increase cigarette profitability as current EBIDTA margins are 5ppt lower than peak margins. Retain Accumulate.

Motilal Oswal

There are no material changes in broking house estimates.

ITC posted a healthy ~ 24% EPS growth in FY23 and Motilal Oswal expect an EPS CAGR of ~15% over the next two years. ITC's earnings outlook is better compared to other large-cap staples players in FY24 and FY25.

At a time when uncertainty looms over the industry due to high inflation, unpredictable monsoons, and continued weak rural sales, ITC's earnings performance in the last couple of years has shined like a beacon.

ITC's dividend yield is healthy at 3.5-4% despite the stock price appreciation.

The key challenges for ITC - an extremely punitive tax regime of the past, Covid-related disruption and commodity cost inflation - now seem to be receding. We maintain BUY rating with a Target Price of Rs 485.

Sharekhan

With no significant increase in tax on cigarettes, will help ITC to maintain volume growth momentum in the cigarette business in the coming quarters. Strong growth in the non-cigarette FMCG business and stellar recovery in the hotel business will drive double-digit revenue and PAT growth over the next two years.

Despite strong run-up in ITC’s stock price in recent times, valuations at 24x/21x its FY2024E/FY2025E EPS look attractive in the backdrop consistent earnings growth visibility and good dividend payout (dividend yield of 3.7%).

Sharekhan maintain Buy rating with a revised Price Target of Rs 485. The company remains one of the preferred picks in the large-cap FMCG space.

Nirmal Bang

Brokerage house continue to remain positive on ITC on the back of (1) Better earnings visibility compared to peers over the next few quarters with consistent volume delivery in the Cigarette business, improving performance of FMCG-Others segment and higher ARR in the Hotels business (2) Healthy RoE in mid-30s and (3) Valuation comfort as ITC is trading at inexpensive multiple of ~22x on FY25E.

Dividend yield for ITC also continues to stay higher (over 4%) and changes to the model have led to 5.4%/7.6% upward revision in FY24E/FY25E EPS.

Considering strong return ratios and consistent delivery by the company, Nirmal Bang assigns a multiple of 25x on March’25E EPS, giving an unchanged target price (TP) of Rs 485. Maintain Buy rating on ITC.

On April 2o, ITC became the 11th listed Indian company to cross Rs 5-trillion market capitalisation after its shares touched a record high with a 21 percent surge so far this year.

Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services, HDFC Bank, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Life Insurance Corp Of India, State Bank of India, HDFC and Bharti Airtel have earlier achieved this milestone.

In fact, ITC's recent surge is slowly narrowing the gap in market capitalisation with India's second largest IT services company Infosys. The IT major's market cap currently stands at Rs 5.07 trillion.

ITC's 110 percent rally over the past two years has come on the back of consistent financial performance by its cigarettes, FMCG as well as hotels businesses. Volume growth in cigarettes has especially been stellar over the past two years. In FY22, it was up 14.5 percent year-on-year. In FY23, analysts peg the number at about 18 percent.

""Cigarette tax stability, backed by deterrent actions by enforcement agencies, allows for continuous volume recovery. On the technical setup, ITC is also showing a positive trend on the daily chart. In the following sessions, investors may retain their holdings with a goal of 420 levels,"" Ravi Singh, head of research at Share India, said.

GCL Broking has a target of Rs 470 on the stock for the next one year. ""ITC has given 52 percent returns in comparison to HUL which has given 19 percent return in 1 year. We still think ITC will outperform over HUL,"" the firm said.

For Q4 FY23, the Street expects ITC's revenue to rise 9.3 percent on-year to Rs 16,972 crore and net profit to jump 17 percent on-year to Rs 4,907 crore.

"April 21, 2023 06:11 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/itc-the-one-indian-conglomerate-thats-in-no-hurry-to-win-10450421.html,"ITC can stay around and compete, provided it can lift the unit’s 9 percent return on assets.

The erstwhile Imperial Tobacco Co of India is a powerful creature even in the post-colonial world — except that it has been kept in a cage for too long by diffused, competing interests.

British American Tobacco Plc, the single-largest owner, has always wanted ITC Ltd, as the firm is now known, to focus on cigarettes, and funnel the profit back to its own shareholders. The local management successfully fought to keep the proceeds of addiction at home with the backing of state-run financial institutions, which together control roughly the same stake as BAT’s 29 percent. As a result of those past battles, ITC is today into everything from hotels and wheat flour to soap, paper and information technology.

Several of those forays have been unimpressive so far, though that is beginning to change. The stock has returned nearly 100 percent in the past 16 months, the best performer on the benchmark Nifty 50 Index. Meanwhile, other Indian conglomerates have stumbled. The tycoon Gautam Adani’s debt-laden infrastructure empire has soared and crashed, while rival Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd has disappointed investors despite aggressive expansion in everything from retail and telecom to green energy.

By contrast, the unhurried pace of ITC, not controlled by any business family, has been reassuring. Rather than launch a fresh empire-building spree, Sanjiv Puri, who rose through the ranks to become chairman four years ago, has focused on long-term sustainability of the existing portfolio. A year before Covid-19, ITC sold its menswear brand John Players to Ambani’s Reliance Retail, and started shuttering Wills Lifestyle, a premium apparel business that never had a chance against e-commerce.

The question now is about other non-tobacco consumer goods in Puri’s stable, such as wheat flour, biscuits, noodles, dairy and beverages. Making food more profitable is ITC’s short-term challenge. The trickier part is to build a low-carbon supply chain around it, connecting tens of millions of farmers with hundreds of millions of consumers.

The country’s eighth-largest publicly traded firm has a market value of $60 billion; it’s sitting on nearly $2 billion of net cash. The 93 percent of profit ITC returned to investors in the last financial year — after steadying its pandemic-ravaged hospitality division — is a welcome relief from the blistering growth family-run Indian businesses have pursued, without much to show for their efforts.

ITC’s sweet spot won't last forever. Even in a nation of 1.4 billion where one in four adults still uses tobacco, the smoking habit must ultimately fade into the sunset. Right now, it’s a great franchise because ITC controls nearly 80 percent of the cigarette market. In the nine months through December, the unit’s revenue grew 22 percent, three times faster than ITC’s own historical average. That’s because of surprisingly stable taxation over the past five years.

With illegally imported sticks losing their price advantage over tax-paid cigarettes, profitability has gone through the roof. On an annualised basis, return on depreciated cigarette assets is approaching a staggering 240 percent, three times the level two decades ago.

A responsible public health approach would require a quid pro quo. The state would ask ITC to start investing in noncombustible products such as heat-not-burn sticks and Swedish snus, helping to counter the sway of bidi — cheap tobacco rolled in coarse leaves — and crushed betel nuts mixed with nicotine, or gutka, an addiction that leads to mouth cancer.

ITC has the technology, but the onus of pushing for harm reduction is on the government. New Delhi’s current policy is the exact opposite: It has imposed a complete ban on e-cigarettes out of a fear that they would become a gateway device for the youth. Those concerns exist everywhere. Even the US Food and Drug Administration has faced criticism for not doing enough to curb flavored nicotine vapors.

But in India, traditional products are a far bigger health risk than new technology. The lobby behind chewable tobacco is formidable. Bidi, the poor man’s preferred option for nicotine delivery, is sparsely taxed because it supports 4 million jobs in rural and semi-urban areas.

Cigarettes give ITC unmatched access to general trade, or the network of millions of mom-and-pop stores that reach buyers across the country’s vast geography. Now that commodity-price inflation following Russia’s war in Ukraine is easing, consumer-goods makers are optimistic of a revival, particularly in rural areas where demand slowdown has been both brutal and protracted.

ITC can stay around and compete, provided it can lift the unit’s 9 percent return on assets. With less mature brands, ITC is lagging behind multinationals like Unilever Plc and may soon have to face new competition in general trade from Ambani. Still, staples provide a natural outlet for its other big bet: agriculture.

One way to meet niche consumer demand for gluten-rich grain is to select it from the wheat crop ITC buys. A more efficient alternative is to help farmers’ collectives grow higher-gluten varieties in areas where it makes the most sense.

From quick soil-test results on mobile phones to hyperlocal weather forecasts, pest predictions, and crop-monitoring by drones, Puri is building a super-app for farmers with climate at its core. The company is already at the receiving end of extreme weather: After a heat wave damaged last year’s wheat crop, India banned exports, hurting ITC’s revenue. Cutting emissions in the food supply chain and protecting farmers from global warming are business imperatives.

Once the new spice processing factory in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, and the upcoming medicinal nicotine export unit in Mysuru, Karnataka, start paying off, the 24 percent return on agricultural assets could start to push against the 30 percent mark. The business is undoubtedly a keeper. So is the paper division. ITC got into cigarette-packaging nearly 100 years ago, and expanded into paperboards in 1979.

Puri is now investing in technology that will cut plastic use in smartphone boxes. (Think of it as a paper-pulp egg tray for electronic devices, only sturdier.) After cigarettes, the paper unit already garners the second-highest margins for the conglomerate.

That brings us to hotels. A strong post-pandemic recovery is under way for nearly every player in the Indian hospitality industry. Beyond that, however, an asset-heavy business that has historically struggled to garner even a 5 percent return doesn’t make sense. ITC's popular restaurant brands will add heft to the cloud-kitchen services it has piloted, while the real estate has its own value.

The first 12 hotel buildings anywhere in the world to be certified as net-zero-carbon by the US Green Building Council are ITC properties. Hiving them off into an investment trust might attract interest even from those institutional investors who won’t go anywhere near tobacco companies.

By disallowing new foreign direct investment in tobacco in 2010, India has practically closed the door on a takeover by British American Tobacco. Unless the government has a change of heart, ITC won’t even do a share buyback that could potentially raise BAT’s stake.

However, Puri can use the window provided by India’s nationalist tobacco policy to extract the most juice out of the capital he’s allocating to more sustainable businesses — while keeping investors hooked with lavish dividends. With time and money on its side, ITC’s best strategy is to be that Indian conglomerate that’s in no hurry to win."

Cigarettes-to-hotels conglomerate ITC Ltd became the 11th listed Indian company to cross Rs 5 trillion market capitalisation after its shares touched a record high with a 21 percent surge so far this year.

The stock hit a record high of Rs 402.60 on BSE and gained as much as 1.1 percent intraday. At 9.30am, the stock traded at Rs 402.30, up 1.2 percent from its previous close, while its market cap stood at Rs5.01 trillion.

Earlier, Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, HDFC Ltd, Infosys Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Life Insurance Corp Of India, State Bank of India, HDFC Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have achieved this milestone.

ITC's impressive performance across all its business segments, including FMCG, paper, and hotels, has made it an attractive choice for investors, especially given the current market challenges caused by high inflation, unpredictable monsoon, continued weak rural sales, and delay in commodity costs decline.

Investors see ITC as a defensive option due to its stable cash flow and dividends. Moreover, the company's strong operational performance, backed by double-digit growth in cigarette volume and a robust recovery in its hotels business, has further enhanced its appeal from a fundamental standpoint

According to analysts, despite facing an uncertain demand environment and persistent inflationary pressures on margins, ITC has demonstrated a resilient performance in the past few quarters. This resilience can be attributed to several factors, including the successful recovery of its core cigarette business in the post-Covid era, consistent double-digit growth in the non-cigarette FMCG business, and accelerated expansion in the hotel and paperboard, paper, and packaging (PPP) business.

According to Motilal Oswal Securities, ITC’s earnings performance in the last couple of years and in FY24 shines like a beacon. The brokerage house expects ITC has demonstrated a healthy 23 percent EPS growth in FY23 and we expect a likely EPS CAGR of 15 percent over the next two years as well. ITC’s earnings outlook is better than other large-cap staples players both on a two-year CAGR ending FY23 as well as FY24 earnings growth expectations.

The Finance Bill 2023 has recently been amended, capping the maximum compensation cess on tobacco products at Rs 4,170 per 1,000 sticks plus 290 percent ad-valorem. Fortunately, ITC's cigarette business is not expected to be adversely affected by this change, analysts added.

""We expect volume growth momentum in the cigarette business to continue in the quarters ahead. Going ahead, the non-cigarette FMCG business is expected to grow in double digits and its OPM (10 percent in Q3) is expected to consistently improve, while the hotel business will benefit from strong industry tailwinds in the coming years. Hence, compared to other large peers, ITC has much better earning visibility (15 percent CAGR over FY2022-FY2025),"" Sharekhan said in a recent note.

Analysts said the ITC is predicted to sustain its volume growth momentum in the cigarette business due to the absence of any price hikes in the foreseeable future and the government's efforts to curb illicit cigarette sales. Additionally, the company's non-cigarette FMCG business is expected to continue its robust growth, the hotel business is set to experience a remarkable recovery, and the PPP business will maintain steady growth. As a result, ITC is anticipated to achieve double-digit revenue and PAT growth over the next two years.

""The stock currently trades at 25.5x, 22.8x, and 20.6x its FY2023, FY2024, and FY2025 EPS, which is at a discount to some large consumer goods companies. With an improving growth outlook for its core cigarette business and margin expansion in the non-cigarette FMCG business, combined with strong cash-generation ability and robust dividend payouts, ITC is expected to enjoy a strong earnings visibility. These factors are likely to result in consistent improvement in the company's valuations over the next few years,"" the Sharekhan report added."

Somewhere between despair and dividends, lies ITC.

For many years, there were three paths available to someone looking to develop the virtue of stoicism – buying an under-construction flat in Delhi-NCR, becoming a litigant, or investing in ITC.

While the first two options still retain their charm, those who went for the third are now finally reaping the rewards.

The cigarettes-to-FMCG giant has at long last woken up from its slumber, crossing the psychologically important milestone of Rs 400 on April 17.

Also Read: ITC tops Rs 400, analysts see 10% upside while investors eye Rs 500

It has posted gains of 48 percent over the past year – making it the top performer in the Nifty 50 pack.

Once the proverbial under-achiever, ITC is today clearly marching to the beat of a different drum, comfortably outperforming not just its domestic peers but also its global counterparts on the MSCI ACWI Tobacco Index.

With more and more investors beginning to filter their stock picks through the prism of corporate governance following the Adani Group crisis, ITC has emerged as a clear beneficiary of this “flight to quality”.

Just that this flight has come after an interminable wait on the runway.

Patience

A joke doing the rounds in traders’ WhatsApp groups during 2021 was that the government was contemplating demonetising the Rs 200 banknote and replacing it with the ITC stock.

Like most good quips, it amused some and infuriated the rest – chiefly the ITC shareholders.

Not without reason.

The stock had first touched the Rs 200 mark in early 2013, and like a recalcitrant tenant, refused to budge from that range for the next almost 10 years (barring a few freak sessions in 2017 and 2018 when it crossed Rs 300).

This, even as the rest of the equity universe was churning out one multi-bagger after another in a steady stream of bull-market exuberance.

In a moment dripping with cosmic irony, 2013 was the year when ITC adorned its logo with a new tagline – ‘Enduring Value’. Since then, the investors had largely endured the stock’s underperformance.

The listless show had become a running gag on social media, polarising opinion in a way no stock had done in recent times.

Many ITC shareholders were spending more time doggedly defending the company on Twitter than doing their actual jobs.

Others simply gave up and quietly exited their positions, though retail ownership of the stock continued to remain elevated.

Maybe the ITC stock was more addictive than its cigarettes.

Investors may not have realized it then, but their company was displaying the inexplicable tendency of champions to flounder for an extended period of time despite their best efforts. Think GE, Wal-Mart and Proctor & Gamble in the 1990s. Or Sachin Tendulkar in the early 2000s. Or Aamir Khan currently.

A host of reasons were conjured up in an effort to explain the stock’s sluggishness – outsized reliance on cigarettes, susceptibility to increased taxation on ‘sin goods’, misallocation of capital, the cash-guzzling hospitality business, rising competition in the FMCG space and even the management’s allegedly indifferent attitude towards the capital market community.

The last one was perhaps a tad unfair.

The company leadership had repeatedly highlighted ITC’s strong business performance, a runway for further growth and a debt-free status, though the arguments imploded with painful predictability on Dalal Street.

Addressing shareholders at its AGM in 2021, the company’s chairman Sanjiv Puri said the board was concerned about the share price not appreciating despite its operational performance and over Rs 50,000 crore of dividends payout in the past five years.

Dividends, in fact, were one area where ITC consistently outshined its compatriots.

Some analysts had even labelled ITC a pure dividend play, notwithstanding all the narrative about post-tobacco diversification.

Not to be outdone, a few Twitter prodigies classified the stock as a fixed deposit (and dividends as interest payments) because there was no capital appreciation whatsoever. This set-off yet another round of mockery and memes-fueled savagery online.

The naysayers were once again having all the fun, but it was the investors, who would have the last laugh.

Turnaround

Sometime in 2022, the gods of fate began smiling on ITC.

That, or the seemingly endless stretch of frothy valuations finally forced the algorithms to hunt for alternative avenues of capital deployment in the bluechip space.

Whatever the reason, ITC staged a phoenix-like turnaround, making its long-suffering investors almost airborne with delight.

Suddenly, the horde of detractors vanished in a puff of smoke and the online commentariat pivoted to hearty appreciation.

Analysts had always viewed the company favourably, but even they were taken aback when the stock started to return the affection.

Most brokerages, including JP Morgan, Nomura, Jefferies, Motilal Oswal and ICICI Securities, currently have a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, with target prices in the range of Rs 450-Rs 475.

While analysts and market watchers are tripping over themselves trying to explain the stock’s recent breakout, the fact is that most of these rationales – cigarette volumes growth, robust FMCG sales, margin expansion etc – were true even during the previous years without any corresponding up move in the share price.

True, the post-Covid pent-up demand is providing additional tailwinds to ITC’s businesses but that may hardly be enough to shake off a decade-long lethargy.

Markets may also be salivating at the prospect of the company finally hiving off its hotels and IT verticals – something the management has repeatedly hinted at without giving any concrete timeline.

Purely from a business perspective, investors can expect the good times to continue.

The company accounts for three out of every four cigarettes sold legally in the country, but the legal market itself is just 8 percent of the tobacco consumed in India.

On the FMCG front, it is seeking to straddle two strong and divergent trends driving consumption – premiumisation and downtrading (where consumers shift to lower price packs).

In an interview with CNBC-TV18 in September 2022, Sanjiv Puri said the company has six brands in the Rs 1,000-crore club and intends to scale these further.

The hotel industry is also seeing never-before demand and ITC is looking to capture a slice of the overseas pie as well.

Clearly, the company has considerable leeway for growth.

But as its investors know so well, the correlation between business performance and stock appreciation can be thinner than the delectable rice vermicelli served in ITC Maurya.

This means that while the stock may be having its well-deserved moment in the sun right now, another period of prolonged consolidation cannot be ruled out.

So what should investors do in that case?

Maybe just sit tight, count the dividends, and enjoy the memes on Twitter."

Diversified conglomerate ITC shares finally went past the Rs 400 mark on April 17, having gained more than 20 percent in 2023. Meme community's favourite and a darling of investors, ITC's 48 percent rise over the past year has made it the best-performing Nifty 50 stock.

At 1.45 pm, the stock was quoting at Rs 401 on the NSE, higher by 1.3 percent from the previous close even as the benchmarks were down almost a percent each with IT stocks pulling down the market.

Follow our live blog for all the market action

ITC is above all its key moving averages. Strong cigarette sales, a rebound in the hotel segment's earnings and a consistent performance by the FMCG portfolio have kept the stock upbeat.

After hitting a low of 28 percent in June 2020, ITC's operating margins have steadily improved to 38 percent as of December 2022.

The stock did take a beating on February 1 intraday when the budget hiked the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) on cigarettes by 16 percent. The reaction was overdone as the Street soon realised that the total tax component (of which NCCD is a small part) on a cigarette stick would go up by only 1-2 percent, said analysts.

Analysts at JM Financial said, ""We expect ITC to accordingly adopt an approach that could also drive its premiumisation agenda and further increase its relative positioning in the industry.""

For Q4 FY23, Kotak Institutional Equities is modelling a 15 percent year-on-year cigarette volume growth and 17 percent cigarette EBIT growth. The FMCG segment revenue is expected to grow at 21.8 percent and hotels' revenue by 72 percent.

Technical view

Soon after ITC topped the Rs 400 mark, calls for Rs 500 started getting louder on Twitter. ""Investors' dream!!,"" tweeted a user.

""No major bearish reversal pattern visible yet. Hence, we suggest a Hold with a closing stop loss below Rs 350 levels. Higher resistance is placed around Rs 435,"" said Awanish Chandra of SMIFS, a research-based financial services firm.

Anuj Dixit of Sovereign Global agrees. ""A 10 percent upside in the coming three months is possible. Meanwhile, Rs 360-375 looks like a good support level,"" he said.

For AR Ramachandran of Tip2Trades, an upmove to Rs 410 should be used by investors to book profits. ""Then, wait for a dip near support levels of 360 to initiate fresh buy positions for much better returns in the months ahead.""

Fast moving consumer good (FMCG) companies confront the risk of below-average monsoon rainfall hurting rural incomes and, consequently their sales, but Jefferies remains overweight on the sector.

Reason: a silver lining in state government budgets that the securities firm says are “exhibiting a populist trend” although overall state expenditure may decline.

An analysis of the budgets of 15 states, which make for 85 percent of India's Gross Domestic Product, shows that spending growth is set to decline from 21 percent in FY23 to 11 percent in FY24.

“But, the bias towards populist spending is visible in the state budgets with a surge in income transfer schemes in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh etc. Big promises have also been made ahead of Karnataka state elections,” Jefferies said in a recent report.

Such announcements can help revive rural consumption and so its conviction on the potential of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies stays firm. Thus, the overweight rating on the FMCG sector.

El Nino

To be sure, not all on the Street share the optimism about FMCG companies, who have been battling steep consumer price inflation that prompted many households to tighten their belts and cut spending.

On top of that, concerns abound about the impact of the El Nino weather phenomenon that causes a warming of temperatures in the Pacific and is associated with lower-than-average rainfall in the subcontinent.

Weather forecaster Skymet predicts a “below normal” monsoon in India at 94 percent of the Long Period Average (LPA) rainfall. In the backdrop of the prediction, many fund managers are turning underweight on FMCG stocks.

“Base-level FMCG consumption is stressed. On top of that, valuations are still expensive across the board,” said Mayur Patel, who manages IIFL Focused Equity Fund.

State sops

Jefferies is unfazed.

It cites the fact that Rajasthan has announced a doubling of free units of electricity to 100 units for all households. Maharashtra has announced Rs 6,000 per farmer direct income transfer at an expenditure of Rs 6,700 crore.

Madhya Pradesh is providing Rs 1,000 per month income transfer to women at Rs 8,000 crore annual cost. And, Chhattisgarh will give Rs 2,500 per month to educated unemployed youth and Rs 6,000 per annum to landless laborers, Jefferies noted.

These announcements, it says, can help revive rural consumption, reinforcing its conviction about the potential of FMCG companies. Rural consumption which makes for 45 percent of the sector’s revenue.

In an earlier report dated January 4, Jefferies analysts had noted that government's focus on launching large new social schemes in pre-election years. Be it the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) scheme in the last election cycle or the national food subsidy scheme prior to that.

“Given the greater presence of the economically weaker sections in rural areas, these schemes tend to benefit the rural economy disproportionately,” the analysts said.

This, coupled with rising activity in the construction sector, the largest employer of unskilled labor, can boost sales volumes in the rural market. Cooling of raw material inflation is also set drive gross margin expansion by 200 basis points and Jefferies expects about 18 percent Earnings Per Share growth for consumer staple companies in FY24, the highest in nearly a decade.

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) authorities are soon going to complete their probe into availment of ineligible input tax credit and will send out more show-cause notices to private insurance companies, sources said.

“The GST authorities are soon completing the investigation and will then issue show-cause notices. Some notices are already issued. Almost all private insurance companies are under investigation,” an official told Moneycontrol.

In case of insurance companies, the issue is that additional commission is being passed on to the agents where there is no supply.

“The GST authorities have booked cases for recovery of input tax credit on the supplies which are not there. To garner more business, the companies have been giving higher commission to agents. Some recoveries have also been made,” he said.

From April 1, the internal cap on commission has been removed, which can now be within the overall ceiling of expenses. “Going forward, this issue should not arise.”

The Director General of GST Intelligence had detected Rs 824 crore wrongful availment of input tax credit by life and non-life insurance companies.

Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary had said that over the last five years, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has filed 106 cases of tax evasion involving Rs 7,581.8 crore against insurance companies. About Rs 1,347.2 crore has been recovered in availment of ineligible input tax credit and other cases."

Another quarter, and the same script for consumer companies. The Street is expecting between 8 and 11 percent revenue growth for packaged consumer goods makers in the quarter ended March 2023 on subdued sales by volume as rural demand continues to lag.

“With no clear signs of recovery in rural demand, sales growth in staples would be led by value growth and premiumization, both of which are also tapering down,” analysts at securities firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services wrote in a note.

Business updates of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) companies are a clear indication of the trend. Dabur, to whose sales rural India contributes 47 percent, said the segment has “fallen short of a full recovery”.

Marico’s management says a visible and sustained recovery is expected only in the coming quarters.

That said, analysts believe Hindustan Unilever, Britannia, ITC and Godrej Consumer Products are expected to outperform peers.

Hindustan Unilever’s revenue growth at 15 percent is expected to be driven by its laundry segment. HUL said on Friday that n February, its Surf Excel brand had crossed the $1 billion turnover mark.

Britannia’s solid run is set to continue on the back of demand resilience in the biscuits category. For ITC, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities are modelling a 15 percent year-on-year increase in volume growth and 17 percent cigarette growth on an Earnings Before Interest and Taxes basis.

Godrej Consumer Products is expected to report good growth on a low base and its entry into low unit packs of hair color cream and premiumization of air freshners.

Volume growth and margins

Sales volume declines may be behind FMCG companies, but projections for growth are not gung-ho. Most companies are expected to post mid single-digit volume growth in Q4, with Kotak pegging the range at 0-6 percent.

In Q4, consumers in rural India remained cautious before buying staples or a discretionary products as has been the case in previous quarters, analysts said.

To bring back volume growth, advertising and promotional spending has been ramped up by most consumer companies and this, in turn, will affect operating margins.

Companies did not have the liberty to increase ad spending over the past few quarters because high raw material inflation was pinching their gross margins. With palm oil prices and Brent crude prices having dipped in Q4, companies took a step ahead in this direction.

There is a huge divergence in EBITDA, or Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization margin growth across companies, Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

Nine of nineteen stocks under its coverage are likely to report flat or lower EBITDA margins year-on-year. ITC, Asian Paints, Britannia and Nestle are likely to report margin expansion of 180 basis points-250 basis points Year-on-Year (YoY). One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Discretionary

Elara Securities’ checks indicate muted demand for paint companies post January and a slowdown in the Business-to-Business (B2B) business vertical.

“Industrial paints, too, are likely to be muted due to flat auto OEM production,” wrote Elara analysts. Asian Paints is expected to report 9 percent YoY sales growth with 6 percent domestic decorative volume growth.

In the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) space, revenue is expected to have declined sequentially since the previous quarter was a festival season. Prices of dairy and flour, two key raw materials for fast food chains, remained elevated in the quarter, which will cause margins to contract further. Jubilant Foodworks’ Same Store Sales may have contracted 2.5 percent.

The one company where analysts are projecting strong double-digit volume growth is Varun Beverages. Kotak Institutional Equities expects 27 percent revenue growth and 20.3 percent volume growth for the company, once again propelled by the energy drink Sting.

In the alcobev segment, United Spirits, Radico Khaitan and United Breweries are seen reporting average growth, but elevated ENA (extra neutral alcohol) prices, which make up 65-70 percent of raw material costs, will adversely affect margins in the quarter. ​

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

Recent amendment in the Finance Bill 2023 on tobacco/tobacco products is unlikely to have any material impact on tax rates on cigarettes. Volume growth momentum in the cigarette business is likely to sustain in the quarters ahead. Consistent good growth in the cigarette business, strong tailwinds in the hotel business and scale-up in non-cigarette FMCG business makes its earning visibility better compared with peers. ITC will continue to invest approximately Rs. 3,000 crore p.a. to support its key businesses and accelerate growth in the coming years.

Outlook

We reiterate Buy on ITC with an unchanged PT of Rs. 450. Attractive valuations at 23x/21x its FY2024/FY2025E EPS and double-digit earnings growth visibility make it our preferred pick in the large consumer goods space from a medium to long-term perspective.

Eight of the top 10 valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 1,03,732.39 crore in market valuation last week, with Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank taking the biggest hit amid an overall weak trend in equities.

During the holiday-shortened week, the 30-share BSE Sensex declined 673.84 points or 1.12 per cent amid concerns over the quantum of the next interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve.

Barring Bharti Airtel and ITC, eight firms suffered erosion from their market capitalisation (mcap).

The market valuation of Reliance Industries plummeted by Rs 41,878.37 crore to Rs 15,71,724.26 crore, the most among the top 10 firms.

The mcap of ICICI Bank tumbled Rs 18,134.73 to Rs 5,88,379.98 crore.

The valuation of HDFC Bank tanked by Rs 15,007.38 to Rs 8,86,300.20 crore, and that of State Bank of India eroded by Rs 12,360.59 to Rs 4,88,399.39 crore.

Motilal Oswal's research report on ITC

As consumer companies continue to struggle in an uncertain operating environment, ITC is better placed than peers with accelerated earnings growth over the past two years, especially in FY23, and strong earnings visibility compared to peers into FY24 as well. Key factors behind its positive outlook are: -Healthy cigarette volume growth in the recent quarters is likely to sustain in the near term, leading to the best three-year and four-year average volume growth for over a decade. With no high indirect tax increase in the FY24 budget, the operating environment is far more conducive compared to the punitive regime of the preceding years. Over the past five to six quarters, the company has sparingly used its pricing lever and can continue to take leverage on the same going forward. Unlike staples peers, the company has displayed resilient operating performance of its ‘Other FMCG’ business in the past few quarters. If wheat costs decline sharply post the Rabi harvest, performance on the segmental margin front can be even better in FY24. Hotels business prospects are likely to be buoyant going forward as highlighted in our thematic report on hotels by our mid-cap team. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock as a result of (a) better earnings visibility over peers in the next few quarters, (b) inexpensive valuations; and (c) attractive dividend yield.

Outlook

The challenges for ITC led by (a) an extremely punitive tax regime of the past, (b) covid related disruptions and (c) commodity cost inflation now seems to be receding. We maintain BUY rating and our target price of INR450.

Nine of the 10 most valued firms faced a combined erosion of Rs 1,87,808.26 crore in market valuation last week, with HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries taking the biggest hit amid an overall weak trend in equities.

Last week, the BSE benchmark tumbled 1,538.64 points or 2.52 per cent amid concerns that the US Federal Reserve might raise interest rates further to curb inflation. Fresh foreign fund outflows also dented investor sentiments.

Barring ITC, all 10 firms, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, ICICI Bank and Hindustan Unilever, were the laggards.

HDFC Bank's valuation declined by Rs 37,848.16 crore to Rs 8,86,070.99 crore at close on Friday.

The market valuation of Reliance Industries fell by Rs 36,567.46 crore to Rs 16,14,109.66 crore.

"February 22, 2023 06:34 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-indias-consumption-story-10135991.html,"“People are buying luxury cars but not chappals and underwear.” The joke was everywhere on Twitter recently. But, jokes apart, it shows the grim reality of India’s ""K-shaped"" recovery.

A K-shaped recovery occurs when different parts of the economy recover at different rates, times, or magnitudes. Though SBI’s economists dismissed the 'K-shaped recovery' critique in a report in January, the Q3 earnings trend flies in the face of that view.

Here’s how India’s consumption story is panning out:

FMCG staples

This segment is a true indicator of a country’s economic health. In India, revenue for the FMCG pack has been on an upward trajectory due to the price hikes to mitigate raw material inflation. But this has come at the cost of volumes.

Rural India constitutes about 36 percent of the sales pie for a typical consumer company and this segment has been reeling under inflationary pressure. So much so, that Nestle India reported a loss in volumes for its Maggi Chotu pack, which costs Rs 7. Except for biscuits, demand in all other FMCG segments has taken a hit.

Also Read: Price hikes hit 'chotu' packs & demand in tier 2-6 towns, rural India resilient: Nestle

While Hindustan Unilever’s Sanjiv Mehta said that he has been seeing “green shoots” in rural demand, there is still a long way to go. According to the report released by data analytics firm NielsenIQ, in October-December, the industry grew 7.6 percent in terms of value but urban volumes grew 1.6 percent year-on-year while rural volumes declined 2.8 percent. Some consumers have down traded to lower unit packs and others to unbranded regional alternatives, analysts noted.

Encouraging winter crop sowing and indications of higher farm income came as good news for the industry but now fears of a subdued monsoon due to El Nino pose a new challenge for the industry.

Consumer discretionary and QSR

“The slowdown in discretionary spends is visible” Not our words. That’s what Uday Kotak said. Be it Asian Paints, Havells or Domino’s operator Jubilant FoodWorks, most discretionary companies have taken a hit on their bottomline as inflation has burned a hole in the low-to-mid income Indian’s pocket.

In Q3, Asian Paints and Pidilite both posted volume growth that was little changed against expectations of 4-5 percent growth. Both flagged demand stress in the rural and semi-urban areas. Electrical consumer goods company Havells reported a 7.2 percent fall in quarterly profit, citing “moderating” consumer demand. Whirlpool India also flagged similar concerns in its earnings statement.

Also Read: Kotak cuts target price for QSR stocks as consumption slows down

Same-store sales growth for quick-service restaurants came in below Street expectations. Analysts believe startup layoffs and the slowdown in IT hiring are impacting spending and sentiment, with the fast-food category also witnessing down trading now. Though the festive season was a good time for the entire discretionary space, the slowdown that has crept in since shows no signs of a turnaround.

Retail

Nykaa’s top boss Falguni Nayar said lower consumer spending impacted the beauty-tech platform’s margin and revenue. It reported a 94 basis points margin contraction in Q3.

Page Industries, which is the exclusive licensee of Jockey, also cautioned that demand is not as buoyant in the ongoing quarter. “We are not seeing any recovery in the market,” managing director VS Ganesh said in a recent earnings call.

Avenue Supermarts’ earnings also disappointed as the higher-margin general merchandise and apparel segments underperformed the FMCG and staples segments. “Discretionary non-FMCG sales did not do as well as expected in this quarter,” said Neville Noronha, CEO & managing director, Avenue Supermarts Limited.

Footwear retailer Relaxo’s Q3 was no different from the industry. Revenue from operations fell 8 percent on-year weighed down by subdued demand in mass segment articles. It also lost market share to unorganised players. On the flip side, luxury shoemakers such as Metro Brands have emerged stronger.

That brings us to the other end of the spectrum.

Hotels and tourism

The hotels and tourism sector is the brightest beacon in the gloomy consumption story. Ever since the pandemic ebbed, the sector has been a major beneficiary of the recovery. In November 2022, the Indian hotel industry recorded its best performance since the pandemic began, with occupancy at 68-70 percent and average rates exceeding Rs 7,000.

The third quarter, which is a seasonally strong quarter thanks to a number of festivals, was strong for hotel companies as they saw sharp jumps in revenue and margins. The management of hotel companies is bullish on the near future as well.

“The outlook is very strong, albeit it is all built mostly on domestic (tourism) because foreign inbound is still lagging behind 2019-20 numbers,” said Puneet Chhatwal, Managing Director & CEO, Indian Hotels, in the chain’s recent analyst call.

He added that there are a lot of events happening this year, “including G20 and the Cricket World Cup, which should further boost demand or provide the necessary buffer should there be any form of headwinds coming from anywhere”.

Analysts concur. In a note, HDFC Securities said that with demand outpacing supply, which the latter is unlikely to catch up with over the next 2-3 years, it expects both average room rates (ARRs) and occupancy to remain strong, leading to higher RevPar for the industry.

Automobiles

Another silver lining in the consumption bucket has been automobiles, especially electric vehicles and sports utility vehicles (SUV). The sector has seen strong growth led by a number of model launches in the mid- to high-end segments.

For some models, such as the Mahindra Scorpio N, Tata Nexon, Maruti Suzuki Brezza and Hyundai Creta, the order backlog is as high as 12 months. The demand is such that the 5-door Jimmy, which Maruti Suzuki launched in January, has already garnered about 17,000 orders, and the count is increasing.

Shares of auto companies have also performed well. BSE Auto, a benchmark index of auto and auto ancillary companies, has returned 17 percent in the last year. Mahindra & Mahindra and TVS Motor are two of the best performing stocks from the sector, with one-year returns in the 50-70 percent range.

One worry has been the poor sales of two-wheelers, which are largely bought by low- and mid-income riders. Motorcycle sales have stagnated, putting pressure on shares of Hero Moto and Bajaj Auto. Eicher Motors has been spared from the selloff as it sells motorcycles in the mid-range, demand for which remains strong.

Sin goods

The so-called sin goods — alcoholic beverages and cigarettes — have also seen strong growth despite challenges. The reason is that they are adapting to inflation, which is hitting the lower economic strata of society.

Some distilleries are banking on premiumisation of their products, targeting mid and high-income consumers, and this portfolio has seen double-digit growth. Cigarette makers, meanwhile, have introduced new sizes that are priced lower and are banking on formalisation of the market.

Hina Nagarajan, MD & CEO of United Spirits, which sells Johnnie Walker branded liquor, said the company continues to witness good growth post-COVID, particularly in the mid-upper segments of the Prestige & Above (P&A) portfolio. That is reflective of the consumption revival in the broader economic context, with the festive season adding further momentum, as mentioned earlier.

“Our premium Indian whiskeys and scotches continue to drive category expansion on the back of the sustained trend of premiumisation. Inflation and the larger global macroeconomic headwinds may act as a bit of a drag, but we believe that consumer demand will continue to be robust,” said Nagarajan.

Cigarette volumes have also been strong, with double-digit growth recorded across makers. ITC, the biggest cigarette seller, recorded 17 percent growth in revenue from this portfolio.

“Several differentiated variants continue to be launched to further strengthen the range of offerings and ensure future-readiness of the product portfolio,” ITC said in a statement.

The share price of ITC dipped 2 percent in the morning session on February 15, the record date for the diversified conglomerate's interim dividend. The slide came after the stock rallied 3 percent in the previous session.

Earlier this month, ITC announced an interim dividend of Rs 6 per ordinary share for the financial year ending on March 31, 2023.

The dividend will be paid between March 3 and March 5, the company said.

At 10 am, the stock was quoting at Rs 379 on the National Stock Exchange, down 1.8 percent. The stock has rallied 14 percent this year.

The company continues to be in focus amid strong financial performance, a hike in National Calamity Contingent Duty and the government's refusal to sell its indirectly stake held in the company.

In the December quarter, ITC's standalone net profit increased 21 percent year on year to Rs 5,031 crore. Its hotels' business revenue also grew by 50 percent to Rs 712 crore as travel rebounded. Its cigarette revenue grew by 16.7 percent YoY to Rs 7,288 crore.

The government does not plan to sell its indirectly held stake in ITC at this point, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on February 14.

“We are currently not selling our stake in ITC. There is nothing on ITC as of now,” Pandey said.

The government holds 974.5 million shares, or a 7.86 percent stake, in ITC via the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI). The value of the government’s stake is about Rs 36,457.22 crore, based on the February 13 closing price of Rs 374.10 apiece. The shares have gained very sharply over the past year.

ITC has a diversified presence across FMCG, hotels, software, packaging, paperboards, specialty papers and agribusiness. Life Insurance Corporation of India held a 15.3 percent stake in ITC and domestic mutual funds 9.66 percent as of December.

Pandey denied news reports that the government is looking to sell its ITC stake to help meet its divestment target for FY23.

“News reports about planning stake sale are wrong stories,” Pandey said.

The disinvestment target for FY23 was revised to Rs 50,000 crore from the budget estimate of Rs 65,000 crore after unfavourable market conditions and a sluggish privatisation drive in 2022. The government plans to raise Rs 51,000 crore from disinvestment in FY24.

SUUTI sold a 2 percent stake in ITC at Rs 291.95 per share in February 2017, mobilising Rs 6,700 crore for the government. No stake sale has taken place after that.

ITC’s management said in 2022 the conglomerate was open to an organisational restructuring that would include the demerger of the hotel business and the listing of its subsidiary ITC Infotech.

ITC’s net profit increased 21 percent to Rs 5,031 crore in the December quarter. Gross revenue grew 2.9 percent to Rs 17,122 crore."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

This follows strong volume growth (15.2%) following stable prices from last 3 years and significant clamp down on smuggled cigarette industry. We believe just small increase (16% increase in NCC cess) in cigarette taxes in FY24 Budget bodes well for volume growth (5.7% and 5% estimated for FY24/25). Non cigarette businesses reported 44% growth in EBIT and outlook remains positive for FMCG (Demand revival and benign input costs), Hotels (ARR and Occupancy led) and Agri, even as Paper and Paperboard margins have peaked out (softer prices). While near term outlook is strong, we estimate 10.7% EPS CAGR over FY23- 25. ITC has significant levers to increase cigarette profitability as current margins are 10ppt lower than FY20 peak margins. ITC trades at 20.8x FY25 EPS with ROE/ROCE of 30.3/36.0% and ~80%+ dividend payout. Any punitive increase in GST on cigarettes is a key risk to our call. Retain Accumulate.

Outlook

We increase our FY23/FY24/FY25 EPS by 1/6.2/7.3% and target price to Rs438 (Rs365 earlier) as we increase PE multiple for cigarette business from 16x to 20x.

International brokerage giant Nomura maintains a 'buy' rating and has raised the target price to Rs 455 per share reflecting optimism about the company's prospects.

It estimates the cigarette volume to improve further on the back of a small tax hike in the Budget. Budget 2023 hiked the National Calamity Contingency Duty (NCCD) by 16%. The brokerage projects that this small tax revision on cigarettes augurs well for its continued strong trend.

The share prices have gained on the back of upbeat earnings. Shares of ITC touched 52-week high of Rs 388.20, rising 2 percent in the early trade on February 6. The standalone net profit zoomed 21 percent to Rs 5,031 crore from Rs 4,156 crore a year back.

The profit beat estimates by a significant margin. According to an average of estimates of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol, the company's bottomline was expected to come in at Rs 4,614 crore.

The market recouped more than half of its previous week's losses and climbed 250 points or 1.4 percent on the Nifty50 during the week ended February 3. The recovery is largely attributed to the short covering-led buying in beaten-down banking and financial services and select Adani Group stocks along with fall in oil prices.

The Nifty50 finally settled above the 17,800 mark, the lower band of previous trading range (17,800-18,250) seen before the recent correction, after taking strong support at 200 DMA (around 17,300).

In the near term, the index is expected to take support at 17,600, which has been holding quite well on every closing in the past six consecutive sessions, with resistance at the 18,000-18,250 zone but, considering the recent news-led activity, further volatility can't be ruled out, experts said.

""Although we managed to recover the lost ground this week, we are not completely out of the woods yet. A continuous news flow with respect to the Adani group is likely to give volatile swings on both sides,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

As far as the levels are concerned, he feels, the immediate support is visible around 17,600; but the major sacrosanct zone remains at 17,400 – 17,300, which coincides with the 200-day SMA. ""Ideally, till the time we defend this, there is no real reason to worry for,"" Chavan said.

On the flipside, if the market has to regain its pride, the Nifty needs to surpass 18,000 – 18,100 on a closing basis, which will confirm the completion of the recent corrective phase and market can then resume the higher degree uptrend, the expert said.

He advised that the banking space needs to be watched closely because it is likely to act as a catalyst for setting the near-term direction for the market. Apart from this, a lot of thematic moves started playing out well towards the end of the week. One must keep focusing on such potential trading opportunities, he said.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the February 3 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Bajaj Finserv: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,337 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 | Target: Rs 1,500 | Return: 12 percent

The stock spent a lot of time between the Rs 1,800 and Rs 1,600 levels during September and November 2022. However, since the stock has broken the trading range at Rs 1,600, we saw a significant fall in the stock towards Rs 1,246 level without any meaningful pullback. The pullback has sent the stock into the highly oversold zone.

Technically, such a pattern could result in a move back to retrace the sell-off. Based on it, the positional traders should be buyers at the current levels with a final stop-loss at Rs 1,240. On the upside, it will find resistance at Rs 1,450 or Rs 1,500.

Technically, it has the potential to move to the next extension levels, which are Rs 400 and Rs 440. On the flip side, Rs 370 and Rs 360 should be support areas for the stock to accumulate. From a medium-term perspective, buy ITC with a stop-loss at Rs 350.

Mahindra Lifespace Developers: Buy | LTP: Rs 380 | Stop-Loss: Rs 340 | Target: Rs 460 | Return: 21 percent

From September 2022, the stock was in a vertical fall from highs of Rs 550, it fell to Rs 350 levels. However, after hitting Rs 350 levels, the stock saw a lot of volume-based activity between Rs 340 and Rs 380 levels.

Technically, the stock has fallen towards the key support area and based on the price and volume expansion, our strategy should be to buy from a medium to long-term perspective. Keep the final stop-loss at Rs 340 for all trading positions. On the upside, we can see Rs 420 or Rs 460 levels.

Here's what brokerages said about the stock and the company after the December quarter earnings:

Motilal Oswal

The brokerage maintained the 'buy' rating with a target price at Rs 450.

""There is no change in FY23 EPS but raised FY24 EPS by 3.5 percent due to better outlook after no material GST/ calamities duty increase in the Budget,"" it said.

The brokerage is positive on ITC because (1) a better-than-expected demand recovery and a healthy margin outlook in cigarettes, (2) healthy sales momentum in the FMCG business, (3) a smart recovery in the hotels business, and (4) better capital allocation in recent years.

A stable tax environment for cigarettes in recent years has allowed ITC to calibrate price increases to avoid a disruption in demand. We expect this trend to continue, which should improve cigarette volumes and earnings visibility in the medium term.

Nirmal Bang

The brokerage house upgraded the stock to 'buy' with revised target price of Rs 465 from Rs 385.

Rural demand did see a sequential improvement, it continues to remain relatively subdued, it observed.

Changes to the model have led to 6.3 percent/6.2 percent/5.5 percent upward revision in FY23/FY24/FY25 EPS.

Considering strong return ratios and consistent delivery by the company, the broking house is increasing its valuation multiple by 15 percent to 26.5x on September 2024 EPS.

HDFC Securities

The broking major retained the 'add' rating on the stock and revised the target price to Rs 385.

With consistent stability in taxes and demand environment, it expects the volume CAGR to remain healthy in the coming quarters. It has estimated a 3 percent increase in EPS for FY23/24/25.

With stability in taxes and demand for cigarettes, HDFC Securities has increased its cigarette valuation multiple to 13x EV/EBITDA vs 12x.

Prabhudas Lilladher

The brokerage house has retained the 'accumulate' rating on the stock and increased the FY23/FY24/FY25 EPS by 1/6.2/7.3 percent and target price to Rs 438 from Rs 365.

""We believe just a small increase (16 percent in NCC cess) in cigarette taxes in the FY24 Budget bodes well for volume growth (5.7 percent and 5 percent estimated for FY24/25)

While near-term outlook is strong, the broking house estimates a 10.7 percent average growth in EPS over FY23-25.

""The company has significant levers to increase cigarette profitability as current margins are 10ppt lower than FY20 peak margins. Any punitive increase in GST on cigarettes is a key risk to our call,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher.

At 09:27 hrs ITC was quoting at Rs 386.40, up Rs 5.90, or 1.55 percent on the BSE.

Hotels business revenue jumped 50 percent to Rs 712 crore as travel rebounded. The segment's operating margin came in at 31.5 percent versus 24.7 percent in the year-ago period, driven by higher RevPAR, operating leverage and structural cost interventions.

Cigarette-to-soap maker ITC is likely to post a decent set of numbers for the December 2022 ended quarter, with standalone revenue growing 11 percent year-to-year to Rs 4614 crore. The company will report its Q3 earnings on February 3, after market hours.

According to an average of estimates of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol, the company's revenue will rise 4.3 percent on-year to Rs 16,547 crore. Sequentially, topline and bottomline are expected to grow 2.5 percent and 3.3 percent.

ITC’s mainstay business of cigarettes, which has been in the limelight for hike in NCCD (National Calamity Contingent Duty) announced in Union Budget 2023, will likely report 10-11 percent YoY growth in volumes and 12 percent growth in sales, as per Kotak Institutional Equities.

Sales from FMCG business is expected to grow 20 percent YoY. While rural demand has been weak for most FMCG companies, ITC’s business does not have much of impact from it. This is due to higher salience of foods, noted analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities.

“Similar to Britannia, ITC’s biscuits portfolio continues to perform well in rural as well as in urban,” they added.

Of all the segments, hotels business is expected to be the outperformer. Analysts at KIE have forecast 40 percent growth in the segment with EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin of 17.8 percent. “Hotels revenue growth and profitability will be key to watch out for as leisure and business travel return to normalcy,” according to analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

There's no stopping diversified conglomerate ITC's bull run. The stock is only 3 percent away from the Rs 400 mark and is trading at an all-time high.

And, that too after taking a beating a day earlier after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget for 2023-24 announced a hike in National Calamity Contingent (NCCD) duty, only to recover swiftly and close in green.

At 12.15 pm on February 2, the stock was quoting at Rs 381.30 apiece on the NSE, up 5.51 percent amid heavy volumes of 34.6 million shares. Earlier in the day, it had hit an all-time high of Rs 384.70 apiece.

Smoke signals

The stock corrected 6 percent as Sitharaman said the NCCD duty on cigarettes was hiked by 16 percent. The reaction was overdone as the Street soon realised that the total tax component on a cigarette stick goes up by only 1-2 percent, said analysts.

The NCCD is a part of the total tax levied on cigarettes. The total tax burden (taxes as a percentage of final tax inclusive retail price) is about 52.7 percent for cigarettes, which includes GST, excise duty as well as NCCD. NCCD is about 10 percent of the overall tax.

The World Health Organization recommends a total tax of 75 percent on tobacco products.

According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, ""The tax increase is lower than Street’s/ours expectations, and we expect legal cigarette players to gain share from the illegal ones."" This means higher volumes for ITC.

Cigarette companies will need to raise prices by 2-3 percent, which is not a big ask and can be easily passed on, analysts said.

Analysts at JM Financial believe the move can re-rate the stock further. ""We expect ITC to accordingly adopt an approach that could also drive its premiumisation agenda and further increase its relative positioning in the industry,"" the brokerage firm said in a report.

It has upped its target multiple on the stock from 23x to 25x price-to-earnings ratio. Nuvama, too, has increased earnings per share (EPS) estimate for FY24 and FY25 by 4 percent each with target price of Rs 450.

After taking a hit during COVID lockdown, cigarette volume growth has been in low double-digits for ITC over the past few quarters. The company derives about 40-45 percent of its topline from this segment, while the rest comes from FMCG, paper and agri divisions.

The Nifty50 on February 1 clocked healthy rally and moved closer to psychological 18,000 mark after the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman delivered good budget with announcement of increase in capital expenditure by 33 percent to Rs 10 lakh crore for FY24 and tax benefits to rural economy & taxpayers, with unchanged capital gains tax, but the selling in Adani Group, life insurance and bank stocks in last couple of hours of trade wiped out all those gains of more than 300 points.

The index has formed bearish candle with long upper and lower shadow on the daily charts, which resembles High Wave kind of pattern formation, indicating the indecisiveness among buyers and sellers about further market trend.

But the Nifty50 strongly defended 200 DEMA (daily exponential moving average - 17,550) for fourth day in a row. Also it has taken a strong support at 200 DMA (daily moving average - 17,300). Further it has still respected long upward sloping support trendline adjoining lows of March 2020 and June 2022, while on the weekly scale, it has so far defended 50 WEMA (weekly exponential moving average - 17,400).

Overall it was a volatile session for the market and the index has been rangebound. Unless and until above support levels get decisively broken, there is no cause of worry, but volatility is likely to continue with resistance at 17,800-18,000 area, experts said.

""The pivotal zone of 17,500 was firmly safeguarded, which implies the significance of the support, followed by the sacrosanct support of 200 SMA which is placed around 17,300. On the higher end, 17,800 is likely to act as a stiff resistance, followed by the crucial hurdle of the 18,000 mark,"" Osho Krishan, Sr. Analyst - Technical & Derivative Research at Angel One said.

Going forward, he feels the market is likely to remain volatile ahead of the aftermaths of the Budget. Meanwhile, traders should keep a close tab on the mentioned levels and avoid aggressive bets till the trend gets clear, he advised.

Here are top 10 stock ideas after the Union Budget. Returns are based on the February 1 closing prices:

Expert: Ajit Mishra, VP - Technical Research at Religare Broking

HCL Technologies: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,132 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,050 | Target: Rs 1,270 | Return: 12 percent

Only a handful of sectors are holding strong in the recent correction and IT is among the top performing names. Within the pack, HCL Tech is leading from the front as it has been rebounding strongly after the breakout from the consolidation range and currently hovering around the previous swing high. Indications are in the favour of the prevailing move to continue.

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,352 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,240 | Target: Rs 1,550 | Return: 15 percent

The auto index has almost retested the record high budget day while the majority of sectors are struggling for sustainability. And, M&M is trading largely in sync with the trend.

It has witnessed a fresh breakout from a consolidation range of Rs 1,200-1,350, after spending nearly four months and currently trading around its record high. We expect the gradual up move from hereon.

Bandhan Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 237 | Stop-Loss: Rs 252 | Target: Rs 210 | Return: 11 percent

The banking index is also witnessing a roller coaster ride in line with the benchmark index and a few stocks like Bandhan Bank have been consistently underperforming the pack.

After a breakdown from a consolidation range, it has been hovering in a narrow band, which has resulted in the formation of a fresh shorting pivot. The chart pattern is pointing towards the retesting of the previous swing low soon.

Expert: Viraj Vyas, Technical & Derivatives Analyst | Institutional Equity at Ashika Stock Broking

ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 361 | Stop-Loss: Rs 340 | Target: Rs 400 | Return: 11 percent

The stock has been in a strong uptrend since February last year and after a brief consolidation of 2 months, the stock looks ready for the next upmove.

Even on the relative strength vs Nifty 50, the RS (relative strength) line continues to trend higher and we expect the stock to outperform in the coming weeks as well.

Mahindra & Mahindra: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,352 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,270 | Target: Rs 1,500 | Return: 11 percent

The stock has been in a secular uptrend since March 2022 and since the last 5 months, has been consolidating (Blue highlight) in a range with positive bias.

On the relative strength front too, the stock appears strong and such outperformance is likely to continue going forward.

Polycab India: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,995 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,820 | Target: Rs 3,300 | Return: 10 percent

The stock has witnessed a stupendous run since pandemic lows, post which, the stock entered a phase of time-price consolidation for a period of 16 months. A breakout of such consolidation zone supported by volumes augurs well for further incremental move towards Rs 3,300-level.

Expert: Rohan Shah, Head of Technical Research at Stoxbox

Amara Raja Batteries: Buy | LTP: Rs 594 | Stop-Loss: Rs 568 | Target: Rs 644 | Return: 8 percent

The stock has generated a breakout from the multi-week base formation with strong volumes highlights upward momentum in price. The multi-week base formation formed at the polarity support which shows bullish price action.

"February 08, 2023 01:51 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/budget-2023-heres-what-top-industrialists-have-to-say-9982001.html,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 presented the last full budget of the Modi government with general elections due in 2024. From raising capex, rejigging tax slabs, giving a boost to the rural sector to education, the Budget tried to pack something for everyone.

Here is what stakeholders and top business leaders have to say about the Budget 2023:

Anil Agarwal, Chairman, Vedanta Ltd

This Budget is one of the best budgets ever, truly inclusive and addresses the aspirations of every section of society. It empowers India’s 1.4 billion people as drivers of the India story. I compliment the PM and FM for the long-term vision that was laid out in the Budget speech as well as the many progressive announcements, like increased outlay for capital expenditure, incentives for the start-ups and MSMEs, green energy, a lower tax for the middle class and boost to tourism which will create massive jobs and reinforce India’s position as the fastest growing major economy in the world.

Bhargav Dasgupta, MD & CEO, ICICI Lombard

The Union Budget FY23-24 is an extremely progressive and inclusive one with a huge focus on infrastructure and capex growth while maintaining the fiscal consolidation path. With fiscal deficit being reduced to 5.9% whilst providing an extremely bullish capex investment of Rs. 10 lac crores (highest ever); will in effect convert revenue expenditure to capital expenditure which has a higher multiplier effect. It will also mean net borrowing by the government being lower than anticipated at Rs 11.8 lac crores and that augurs well for the bond market and the corporate sector as a whole. Moreover, with tax relief at an individual level would mean an additional Rs 35,000 crores available for consumption. Fuelled by ease of doing business related policies and regulations, this will bolster growth especially in the highly regulated financial services space. For a category like general insurance, these macro economic indicators would provide the much-needed thrust for bridging the penetration gap in the country.

There are some pertinent developments that will enable growth for the industry in the longer horizon. The focus on tourism will pave the way for not just generating employment and investments but also travel insurance in the long term. We have always been zealot about capacity and capability building in health arena and Govt setting up nursing colleges is a positive development. Infact I believe the CoE on AI being set up could be a game changer with access to right talent pool in India. On the auto front, the old vehicle and ambulance scrapping policy is a step in the right direction. Overall, the budget this year has been growth oriented while also being fiscally responsible which is laudable.

Rakesh Bharti Mittal, Vice Chairman of Bharti Enterprises

Telecom is the highest taxed sector today. The only thing we were asking the government to look into were taxes for our sector. That is something we wish for and will look ahead for in the next year budget. However, it has been an inclusive budget and we are happy with it.""

Sanjeev Puri, MD, ITC

It is a very good, growth-oriented budget. It shows consistency of thought & strategy. Good for business environment. It is inclusive & prudent & touches all sectors of society for development. Public works when combined with growth we are seeing of private capex, though it is nascent right now, it will have a progressive future & good multiplier effect on the economy & make our economy more competitive.

Bimlendra Jha, Managing Director, Jindal Steel & Power

As expected, the government continues to put focus on infrastructure and construction with a budgetary allocation of Rs 10 lakh crores for the sector. This augurs well for Steel and Cement. These industries will also gain from the focus on rail and transport infrastructure projects as well as budgetary allocation to improve urban infrastructure in tier 2 & tier 3 cities.

Sumant Sinha, Chairman and CEO, ReNew Power

The focus of the budget on expanded support for infrastructure investment, growth of small industry and agriculture sectors, while committing to fiscal consolidation, strikes the right balance. In the context of overall geopolitical and economic outlook, the outlay of Rs 35,000 crore for energy transition and energy security is a significant step forward. We believe the Finance Minister has presented a Green Budget that demonstrates the Government of India’s unwavering commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2070.

For the clean energy sector, there are several welcome announcements. Support for Battery Energy Storage Systems (requested by ReNew Power during pre-budget consultations), the transmission infrastructure to evacuate power from Ladakh, the allocation for biogas to energy projects and the initiatives for scrapping of old vehicles of the central and state governments are all significant steps in the right direction. We look forward to seeing further details on the recently announced Rs 19,500 crores allocation for the National Green Hydrogen Mission.

The budget will give a thrust to accelerating clean energy in India and ReNew Power is committed to support the Government of India in this endeavour.

Kamal Bali, MD & President of Volvo Group in India

The budget is commendable for being extremely well thought out - it is growth-oriented, bold, inclusive and responsible, upping the ante on infra creation, connectivity and logistics efficiency as well as on green & digital future. Clearly, the budget has brought in the entire value chain especially the youth, MSMEs and the Agri sector, while being fiscally prudent. I am sure the private sector will respond very pragmatically to this outstanding budget.

Ritesh Agarwal, Oyo founder and CEO

We welcome the move to develop 50 cities across India as a complete package for domestic and international tourism and developing an app to ensure all the key metrics related to travel and tourism for the said cities are regularly updated.

We also laud the move to incentivise states to set up ‘Unity Malls’ in their most popular tourism destination for the promotion of GI, ‘Made in India’ products and handicrafts. Integrated development of theme-based tourism circuit under the Swadesh Darshan Scheme, with special focus on improving infrastructure and amenities in border villages will provide a much-needed boost to rural and agriculture tourism. This will empower the farmers in building and setting up homestays that provide an additional source of income for them while also providing an authentic Indian experience to the travellers.

Dilip Oommen, President of Indian Steel ssociation, & CEO of AM/NS India and Executive Vice President of ArcelorMittal

A progressive ‘Saptarshi’ Budget – the first in Amrit Kaal – has hit the right notes to fuel growth across industries and propel India to become a global manufacturing hub.

A significant 33% increase in capital expenditure to Rs 10 lakh crore – 3.3 % of the GDP, thrust to fast-track infrastructure development, and the highest ever Rs 2.40 lakh crore for railways will translate into robust domestic steel demand, thus spurring private investments and job creations.

First and last-mile connectivity for sectors like steel, ports, coal, etc. with an investment of Rs 75,000 crore will improve logistics efficiency. This Budget is focused on growth and improving consumption. At the same time, there is a focus on the green economy and digitalisation. Reforms are on the right trajectory of fiscal consolidation to reach the targeted fiscal deficit level below 4.5% by 2025-26.

The Budget underpins a long-term plan that shows the right path to drive economic revival at a time when advanced economies are facing a tough time.

Rajesh Gopinathan, MD & CEO, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)

The Union Budget 2023 by the Honourable Finance Minister further builds on the government’s focus on enhancing India's digital infrastructure and enabling growth pathways for the Indian economy. The provisions for research in artificial intelligence and 5G implementation, and the Government's vision of Make AI in India and Make AI work for India are commendable. Bringing in the National Data Governance policy is also a welcome step. Overall, it's a forward-looking budget that will fortify the digital spine of the country.

Prashant Kumar, MD & CEO, YES BANK

The Union Budget 2023 attempts an inclusive growth structure for the economy through various measures that are expected to reach the last mile. The effective capex of the Central government was enhanced to INR 13.7 Lakh crores, or 4.5% of the GDP was an acknowledgment that capital expenditures are crucial for the economy and could boost the growth.

As the efficiency of capital expenditures is higher at the state level, the government once again earmarked INR 1.3 lakh crores as a 50-year loan to States, which would incentivize capital expenditure. ECLGS scheme continues with an additional INR 9000 crore added to the corpus which would boost the fund flow for the MSME sector.

Angshu Mallick, MD & CEO, Adani Wilmar Ltd.

We congratulate the central government for guiding the country to become the 5th largest economy in the world. The Union Budget 2023 reflects upon the government's plan to stimulate India's economy with a well-planned policy and regulation-based framework. We believe, the various schemes and policies will play a critical role in laying the foundation for accelerated digitalization and enabling Indian businesses to become prominent players on the global stage.

As one of the leading players in the FMCG sector, we are optimistic about a strong uptick in rural demand on the back of ,massive wave of digitisation through an array of infrastructure-led initiatives announced by the Government, thereby empowering the farmers and the agricultural sector. Furthermore, decentralisation in storage facilities will provide further assistance to ensure India’s surplus food produce is not wasted. The total CAPEX outlay in the Union Budget has been enhanced by 33% from 7.5 Lakh Cr to 10.0 Lakh Cr which takes it to an all-time high of 3% of GDP, this positive outlook will surely stimulate consumption, generate opportunities both in rural and urban employment and jack up local production.

Overall, the Union Budget 2023 lays a strong foundation for India@100 with enhanced focus on farming sector, which is the backbone of Indian economy as well as digitisation that will open new growth opportunities for the economy.

Rajesh Magow, Co-Founder and Group CEO of MakeMyTrip

It is noteworthy that the Honorable FM has highlighted tourism as a focus area. The union budget entails multiple welcome initiatives like the revival of 50 airports, the building of 50 new destinations, and high budgetary outlays on railways, roads, and highways, which will help long-term growth for the domestic travel and tourism industry.

However, one budget proposal that will negatively impact the industry is the move to increase the TCS mandate from 5% to 20% on overseas tour packages. This will not only increase the upfront cash outflow for customers but will also give an unfair advantage to foreign-based online travel booking platforms over India-based travel agents and tour operators.

Abhay Bhutada, MD, Poonawalla Fincorp

The 2023-2024 Union Budget presented by FM Nirmala Sitharaman showcases the government's commitment to putting people first and uplifting the nation's financial status. With a focus on 'janbhagidari' through 'sabka saath, sabka prayaas' and seven pillars, including green growth, youthpower, and infrastructure investment, this budget sets the foundation for a technology-driven and knowledge-based economy. The new tax slabs, with a reduced maximum marginal rate of 39% and an income rebate limit of Rs 7 lakh, empowers the middle class with more spending power, thereby elevating the country's economy.

The government's continued support and commitment to the MSME sector are commendable, as it is crucial in driving the nation's economic growth. The improved credit guarantee scheme, along with reducing compliances will significantly help alleviate stress in the MSME sector."

ITC shares rebounded sharply from the day's low to trade with 2 percent gains in the afternoon session on February 1, after analysts assessed the tax hike announced by the Finance Minister on cigarettes is not very high and can be easily passed on to customers.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget 2023-24 on February 1.

The stock fell as much as 6.5 percent intraday to hit a day's low of Rs 329 on the NSE after the FM said the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) on specified cigarettes is proposed to be revised upwards by about 16 percent.

The NCCD on specified cigarettes was last revised three years ago, the FM said while addressing the Parliament.

The ITC stock recovered more than 11 percent from the day's low and hit an intraday high of Rs 365.70. At 13:28 hours IST, it was quoting 1.2 percent higher at Rs 356.6 amid volatility.

The cigarette segment contributes more than 40 percent to the total business for ITC and the rest of the revenue comes from FMCG, paper and hotel businesses.

ICICI Direct said the net tax on cigarettes would increase by Rs 0.07 per stick to Rs 0.12 per stick, which would require a 1-3 percent price hike for cigarettes in different categories.

The hike in taxes is not very high and would be easily passed on by a small increase (1-3 percent) in prices, the brokerage said.

The 16 percent hike in NCCD duty rate directly translates into a tax hike of 1.5 percent - including the impact of price hike (due to cascading taxes), overall tax hike comes to around 2 percent. This is a clear positive for ITC,"" Jefferies said in its note.

With effect from February 2, 2023, the government has decided to increase the NCCD duty rate on filter cigarettes of length not exceeding 65 mm as well as cigarettes of length exceeding 65 mm but not exceeding 70 mm, from Rs 440 to Rs 510 per 1,000 sticks.

The duty rate on filter cigarettes of length exceeding 70 mm but not exceeding 75 mm has been revised upwards from Rs 545 to Rs 630 per 1,000 sticks, while for other cigarettes, the duty rate increased to Rs 850 per 1,000 sticks, from Rs 730, and for cigarettes of tobacco substitutes, the new rate would be Rs 690 per 1,000 sticks, up from Rs 600 earlier.

Further, other than filter cigarettes, of length not exceeding 65 mm, the new duty rate would be Rs 230 per 1,000 sticks, up from Rs 200 earlier and for the length between 65 mm and 70 mm, the rate increased to Rs 290 from Rs 250 per 1,000 sticks.

Technically, ITC stock has formed a high wave kind of pattern on the daily charts. After taking support at around Rs 325 - Rs 327, overall, it has been in an uptrend, rising nearly 9 percent so far in the last couple of weeks.

Among others, Golden Tobacco also rebounded, rising 2.2 percent, whereas Godfrey Phillip remained under pressure, down 4 percent.

With the breaking of month-long consolidation range, bears have taken charge of Dalal Street ahead of the Union Budget. In fact, it was a disheartening start to the February series on January 27 and, as a result, the market shed more than 2 percent in the passing week.

The Nifty50 closed at more than four-month low of 17,604, breaking out of the strong support at 17,800 held for a month amid consolidation and posting the biggest weekly loss since the week ended December 23.

The next support lies at 50 WEMA (weekly exponential moving average) of 17,400 after breaking the short-term moving averages of 9, 20 and 21 weeks. Experts hope to see a lot of volatility given the Union Budget week, but if the Nifty manages to hold the 50 WEMA, then there are fair chances that the index can easily surpass the 17,800-18,200 zone in the coming days, followed by 18,500.

""From an optimist point of view, it’s good that the market is approaching this event (Budget 2023) on a lighter note and any favourable outcome would lift the markets higher. On the other hand, a slight disappointment would lead to further aberration in the market,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

""Considering the ‘positive divergence’ in the ‘RSI-smoothened’ oscillator, we may expect some recovery from lower levels,"" he said.

He feels 17,700 – 17,800 are to be seen as strong hurdles. If the market has to regain strength as well as confidence, Nifty needs to surpass 18,000 on a closing basis.

The market expert advised traders to keep a note of all these scenarios and should ideally remain light ahead of the event.

Let's take a look at the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the January 27 closing prices:

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Reliance Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,337 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 | Target: Rs 2,700 | Return: 15 percent

For the past 8 months, the stock has been in a wide trading range of Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,700. Whenever the market falls to extreme levels, Reliance falls on the lower boundary of the bearish parallel. On the other hand, Reliance was at Rs 2,700 whenever the market touched 18,500 level.

After a period of 4 months, the stock has again fallen to the level of Rs 2,300. Based on the logic of the bullish parallel channel, contra traders should be buyers at current levels and more on the downside around Rs 2,250. However, it requires a final stop-loss at Rs 2,150. On the upside, Rs 2,440, Rs 2,550 and Rs 2,700 would be major barriers.

Titan Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,331 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,150 | Target: Rs 2,600 | Return: 11 percent

From the lows of July 2022, the stock displayed a spectacular rally. It was at Rs 1,800 level and moved to Rs 2,790 in a period of 4 months, which is significant.

In the last 3 months, the stock is displaying a corrective move and has hit the support of 50 percent retracement ratio of the entire rally of Rs 1,000 points.

The positional/Contra traders should be buyers at current levels and more on dips at Rs 2,230. Place a stop-loss at Rs 2,150, which is slightly below the retracement level of 61.80 percent. Hurdles would be Rs 2,500 and Rs 2,600.

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,616 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,500 | Target: Rs 1,750 | Return: 8 percent

The stock remained well above Rs 1,600-1,550 levels in last 3 months. In fact, whenever the stock dropped to Rs 1,600 or Rs 1,550 levels, it was quickly bought up.

In the last three days, Bank Nifty and bank stocks declined vertically, however, HDFC Bank remained the least loser.

Technically, we should be positional buyers between Rs 1,600 and Rs 1,550. Keep stop-loss at Rs 1,500. On the upside, the stock may decline towards Rs 1,680 or Rs 1,750 levels.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 346 | Stop-Loss: Rs 334 | Target: Rs 367 | Return: 6 percent

The stock has recently seen a corrective phase where prices have corrected from the high of Rs 361 to Rs 325. The stock has now given a breakout from a falling trendline resistance and has seen a gradual increase in volumes along with the price upmove.

The prices have also managed to show relative strength in the volatile markets during last week. The RSI (relative strength index) oscillator is hinting at a positive momentum and hence, we expect an upmove in the stock in the short term.

Hence, short term traders can look for buying opportunities in the range of Rs 346-342. The possible near term targets for the stock are expected around Rs 358 and Rs 367. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 334.

Maruti Suzuki: Buy | LTP: Rs 8,737 | Stop-Loss: Rs 8,420 | Target: Rs 8,970 | Return: 3 percent

Post a corrective phase, the auto stocks have seen a positive momentum during last week and within this sector, Maruti has witnessed a pullback move along with rise in volumes. After the recent price-wise correction, the stock witnessed some consolidation and price volumes action indicates that the stock would resume its higher degree uptrend.

The RSI oscillator is in buy mode on the daily chart and is turning positive on the weekly charts as well.

Hence, traders can look to buy the stock on dips in the range of Rs 8,620-8,600 for potential targets around Rs 8,820 and Rs 8,970. The stop-loss for long positions should be placed below Rs 8,420.

Expert: Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital

KEI Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,573 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,465 | Target: Rs 1,780 | Return: 13 percent

The stock's price has surpassed the 20-week EMA which acted as a variable support for the prices.

The bounce to the upside in the latest week is preceded by the prices taking support from the 16-week EMA, which acted as a strong variable support to the prices.

The RSI on the Daily timeframe has given a breakout, which reflect strong bullish momentum.

We expect the prices to move higher till the level of Rs 2,900 where the stop-loss must be of Rs 2,330 strictly on the closing basis.

Tata Motors: Buy | LTP: Rs 445.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 390 | Target: Rs 560 | Return: 26 percent

The correction in the Tata Motors post January 2022 took in a disciplined way as the stock did not get into lower low, lower high formation.

The stock in the latest week gave a breakout from the Descending Triangle pattern which points towards the beginning of the trend to the upside.

The breakout is confirmed as it was accompanied by higher volumes and a gap.

Expert: Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand Rathi

Emami: Buy | LTP: Rs 439 | Stop-Loss: Rs 409 | Target: Rs 480 | Return: 9 percent

In spite of the fact that the said counter has witnessed massive beating after making the high of Rs 524 on September 26, 2022 which resulted in a 22 percent cut in stock price. Since last month the said counter looks like it has stabilized around Rs 410-415 zone.

Following are some important points that are making Emami as a buy candidate:

Bullish Bat was seen on a daily scale with a potential reversal zone of Rs 415-425. Furthermore, bullish divergence was seen on the daily scale of RSI (relative strength index) and MACD (moving average convergence divergence). In addition to bullish divergence, trendline violation was seen on RSI. (refer to the chart).

Selling volume has dried up from the recent fall from Rs 480 to 410 thus indicating a possible turnaround. In the previous trading session, the counter witnessed decent buying of 4.5 percent supported by good volume at lower levels.

Looks like the price structure has changed since Emami has vouched for by breaking its previous swing high of Rs 438 and successfully closing near Rs 440 mark.

One can buy in the range of Rs 436-442 in a small tranche and another around Rs 420-425 (if tested again). Target is expected at Rs 480 with a stop-loss of Rs 409 on a daily closing basis.

PVR: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,740 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,649 | Target: Rs 1,825 | Return: 5 percent

At the current juncture, PVR is trying to stabilize near the 0.618 retracements of its previous rally which was started from December 2021 till August 2022.

The stock has seen uptrend and bullish candle formation for fourth straight session, with significantly large volumes. In fact, it has been in an uptrend since the breakout of downward sloping resistance trend line adjoining September 1 last year and January 18, 2023.

ITC was another large-cap stock that performed better, climbing 2 percent to Rs 346, the biggest closing level since November 14 last year and formed bullish candle on the daily charts with higher high formation for fourth straight session, with above average volumes for last several sessions. It has given a decent breakout of long downward sloping resistance trend line adjoining multiple touchpoints at higher levels (November 9, November 11 last year, and January 25).

Supreme Industries was also in focus, jumping more than 5 percent, the biggest single day gains since December 26, to close at Rs 2,539, the highest closing level since December 19. The stock has formed strong bullish candle on the daily charts with healthy volumes, with higher highs higher lows for third straight session.

(Photo courtesy chef Swapnadeep Mukherjee, Metropolitan Hotel, New Delhi)

Diversified entity ITC Ltd on Wednesday announced an initiative to promote millets in food as part of its steps to ensure food and nutritional security in the wake of challenges from climate change.

The company will be putting together strengths of its agriculture, food and hospitality business verticals to promote millets with plans to introduce products with the cereal in most of its categories.

Due to climate change, long period of extreme weather events raise a big issue of food and nutritional security despite all the steps taken up for decarbonisation and its mitigation, ITC Ltd Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said addressing a virtual press conference.

""I think it (millets) can certainly play a significant role in addressing this issue because millet is nutritious, planet-friendly and resilient. Millet uses 70 per cent less water than rice. It has 40 per cent less use of energy as compared to wheat in processing. It grows in half the time as wheat grows,"" he asserted.

With the UN declaring 2023 as the International Year of Millets, guided by the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Puri said ITC has also ""decided that we will bring all our enterprise strengths together and we will collectively put our shoulder to it and give a big push in this area."" ""In most of our categories, we will find variants with inclusion of millets. We will also find, where feasible, products made out of 100 per cent millets. We will also find things like multi millet mix that gives the opportunity for consumers to add a little bit to whatever they are preparing and start going through the journey of welding that kind of taste...,"" he added.

ITC has already introduced a number of millet-based products under the Aashirvaad Nature Superfoods brand, including ragi flour, gluten free atta, multi-millet mix. It is further developing a comprehensive millets-based portfolio under popular brand names and in familiar formats to enable easier adoption.

The company plans to launch millet-based noodles and millet pasta under YiPPee! brand, Ragi vermicelli, multi millet dosa mix, multi millet rava idli mix under Aashirvaad brand, 100 per cent multi millet-based cookies under Sunfeast, millet choco-sticks confectionary under Candyman Fantastik brand and millet-based snacks under Bingo! Puri said under ITC Mission Millet, the company's agri, foods and hospitality businesses will work on initiatives to build awareness on millets focused on educating consumers, empowering farmers.

The company will seek to encourage trials through various millet-based range of products and formats to help build the taste; make millets more palatable and tastier by sharing healthy recipes, tips and hacks."

ITC, the breakout stock of last year, saw some buying on January 18 after the company announced acquisition of Sproutlife Foods Private Limited, the makers of Yoga Bar, a health food.

The cigarettes-to-hotel conglomerate said it plans to acquire 100 percent of Sproutlife in multiple tranches. It will pick up 47.5 percent in the company in two tranches for investments of Rs 175 crore and Rs 80 crore by 2025.

The price for the rest of the stake is yet to be fixed. It will be determined based on pre-agreed valuation criteria, within three months from the date on which Sproutlife provides the audited financial statements for the financial year ending on March 31, 2026.

Suhasini Sampath, co-founder of Sproutlife, said the company deals in products offering high gross margins. Its gross margin is in the range of 40-50 percent, he said.

ITC has been criticised time and again for comparatively lower margins for its FMCG portfolio. The addition of a high-margin product to its portfolio will definitely be a help.

Sampath said he was excited about having access to ITC’s strong distribution network. “ITC will help us in improving logistics,” he told CNBC-TV18.

In the fiscal year 2022, Sproutlife made a sale of Rs 68 crore - up from Rs 32 crore and Rs 39 crore in the previous two years respectively. Sampath estimated that Yoga Bar sales will cross Rs 100 crore in FY23.

The stock hit a high of Rs 336.50 on January 18, up over 1 percent from previous close. However, it saw some profit-booking at high levels but still traded up 0.6 percent at Rs 334.

In the F&O market, open interest for ITC reached the week’s high level, climbing 4 percent on January 18. Rising price and open interest means a bullish setup is emerging in a stock.

Analysts have a positive view on ITC. Bloomberg data shows 33 analysts have a ‘buy’ call on the stock with two assigning ‘hold’ ratings. The stock has failed to leave a mark so far this year and is flat. Its one year performance is still impressive at 51 percent.

ITC has signed a binding term sheet to acquire 100 per cent shares of SFPL over a period of three to four years, said a statement.

It will initially acquire a 47.5 per cent stake in SFPL in tranches, by March 31, 2025 and the balance stake will be acquired, basis pre-defined valuation criteria, subject to other conditions agreed to in the binding documents, it added.

An ""initial investment of Rs 175 crore will be made through primary subscription and secondary purchases for the acquisition of 39.4 per cent of the paid-up share capital, which is expected to be completed by February 15 2023,"" said ITC in a regulatory filing.

Further, a cash infusion of Rs 80 crore will be made through primary subscription, in one or more tranches, by March 31, 2025, it added.

The purchase of the balance 52.5 per cent shares taking the shareholding to 100 per cent would be determined based on pre-agreed valuation criteria and subject to fulfilment of various terms and conditions, it added.

According to ITC, it is ""fortifying its presence in the Rs 45,000-crore, fast-growing, nutrition-led healthy foods space"" with the proposed strategic investment in SFPL.

In FY22 SFPL, the startup engaged in manufacturing and sale of products catering to health-conscious consumers under the new-age digital-first brand Yoga Bar, had a turnover of Rs 68 crore.

According to ITC, this acquisition is ""in line with the strategy to augment the company's future-ready portfolio, the proposed acquisition will strengthen and expand its reach with innovative food products for health-conscious consumers."" The acquisition will enable ITC to augment its future-ready portfolio and enhance market presence in the 'good for you' space which currently includes Aashirvaad Multi-Grain Atta, Aashirvaad Nature's Super Foods, Farmlite range of biscuits, Sunfeast Protein Shake, B Natural Nutrilite ABC Beverage, among others.

""Yoga Bar is expected to be rapidly scaled up, leveraging ITC's enterprise strengths in areas such as sales & distribution, sourcing, product development, and digital,"" it added.

ITC divisional chief executive, Foods Division, Hemant Malik said: ""We look forward to scaling the Yoga Bar brand offering superior and healthy consumer choices. Within a short span of time, Yoga Bar has established itself as a leading brand in the healthy foods space, driven by impactful market positioning and a range of innovative products."" Suhasini Sampath Kumar and Anindita Sampath Kumar, co-founders, said: ""We are confident that this partnership will add to Yoga Bar's competitive advantage and take it to the next level from the current annualised run rate of over Rs 100 crore."" The health and wellbeing segment is a fast-evolving category in India and several FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) companies are entering the space.

Last week, FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd announced the completion of the acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in Zywie Ventures, a wellness company which owns OZiva brand, for a consideration of Rs 264.28 crore.

Besides, HUL has also announced the acquisition of a 19.8 per cent stake in Nutritionalab Pvt Ltd (Wellbeing Nutrition) for a cash consideration of Rs 70 crore."

Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are likely to see an improvement in their margins sequentially in the October-December quarter due to the liquidation of high-cost inventory and a fall in raw material prices. Revenue growth, however, is expected to be slower due to inflation affecting demand, mainly in rural areas, say analysts.

For the 19 consumer companies under its coverage, Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects 9.3 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in topline, 9.6 percent in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and 8.1 percent in net profit.

The majority of the revenue growth will be driven via price hikes, which companies took in the past quarters to combat raw material inflation.

“With no clear signs of recovery in rural demand, we expect sales in staples to be driven by price increases and some premiumisation,” Motilal Oswal said.

According to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE), Nestle and Britannia will lead the staples pack with revenue growth of 19 percent YoY and 16 percent YoY. Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is expected to post 14 percent YoY revenue growth.

“Foods will outperform personal care. Biscuits and noodles are expected to see robust momentum due to downtrading from street food,” stated Nuvama Institutional Equities.

Rural demand still sluggish

Rural demand did not improve at all in Q3, note analysts. Dabur India in its Q3 business update highlighted that the pressure on rural demand was further aggravated by the late onset of winter in north India.

Marico’s Q3 business update was also downbeat. The Parachute oilmaker said its consolidated revenue will grow in the low single-digit on a YoY basis due to a muted recovery in rural demand amid elevated inflation.

“General inflation and rainfall deficit in populous states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Jharkhand remain the key challenges, which have affected rural disposable income,” according to analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities.

Margins and volume growth

The good news for FMCG companies is set to come on the margin front. Gross and operating margins will see sequential improvement as raw material prices have cooled off significantly from their peak and high-cost inventory has been liquidated. However, analysts believe that increased ad spends can keep margin improvement in check.

“The major benefits of benign raw material prices will be witnessed in Q4FY23 onwards,” as per a note from Philip Capital.

Meanwhile, volume growth is expected to be subdued. Kotak analysts expect 4 percent underlying volume growth from HUL, 4 percent from Britannia and 2 percent from Godrej Consumer. In October, HUL cuts soaps prices across India due to a fall in palm oil prices, and as a result, volume trajectory is likely to improve in soaps, believe experts.

Discretionary demand dwindles

The picture looks grim for discretionary companies as the industry saw a demand slowdown in Q3 across paints, jewellery, apparel and QSR (quick service restaurants).

“Paint volumes remained muted in October due to a high base and rains, which affected festive demand, but November and December marked good recovery,” notes Nuvama Institutional Equities.

KIE estimates Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac’s revenue to decline YoY by 1 percent and 5 percent respectively. Berger Paints and Indigo Paints may clock 7 percent and 8 percent revenue growth, respectively.

Also Read: Kotak cuts target price for QSR stocks as consumption slows down

“Varun Beverages and Westlife Development should report a good print, whereas Jubilant Foodworks, Devyani International and United Spirits should report a weak quarter,” the report added.

Westlife Development’s average daily sales are expected to be resilient, partly aided by a 2 percent price hike taken in October while Varun Beverages is set to outperform on the back of market share gains in under-penetrated areas with its energy drink Sting.

If you look at the Nifty’s move this year, from 17,600 to 15,300 to 18,800 and back to 17,900 ― investors bled money, made money and again lost some before closing the year. It was nothing short of a roller-coaster ride.

Many stocks made headlines but the ones that really left a mark were those that were picked up by the meme community. Be it a stunning rally or a disappointing decline, memes made some stocks eternal this year. Reddit, Twitter, and WhatsApp were all flooded by them and investors had a good laugh in a year marred by market volatility. Let’s take a look at some.

HDFC twins

On April 4, before the market opened, an announcement took everyone by surprise. A transformational merger between HDFC and HDFC Bank sent newsrooms into a scurry. It was not anticipated. There were hardly any whispers on such a deal brewing. “I am disappointed with media intelligence,” said Deepak Parekh as he addressed reporters in a press conference.

Nevertheless, the announcement gave enough fodder to memers who unleashed their creativity. As the merger is all set to create a $160-billion financial services behemoth, investors were quick to liken it to Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s popular dialogue from Gangs of Wasseypur – Kabhi kabhi lagta hai apun hi bhagwan hai.

Adani Enterprises

Akshay Kumar sported an eccentric polka dot shirt in Hera Pheri and claimed he can double your money in 25 days. That was a lie, but Adani Enterprises has certainly managed to do so in the span of one year. The stock began its 2022 climb at Rs 1,700 and is all set to end above Rs 3,700. A big trigger was its entry into the Nifty 50 index in September.

The flagship entity of Adani Group and its Chairperson Gautam Adani were in the limelight for many other reasons, as well. A cement deal which makes it the second-largest player in the space, a media deal which made heads turn, a blockbuster debut by the group’s FMCG arm, and a relentless rally that has propelled its promoter to Asia’s richest man ― it was certainly an eventful year for Adani Enterprises. Not to forget, a mind boggling 345x P/E valuation has also left many investors scratching their heads.

LIC

The public insurer’s listing on May 17 was the event of a lifetime. The government’s 3.5 percent stake sale in the 65-year-old institution made it India’s biggest ever initial public offering (IPO). It fetched close to Rs 21,000 crore. The issue price was set at Rs 949 apiece. Retail investors lapped up the shares, with their allotted quota subscribed 1.99 times. It was the perfect recipe for a grand success, but then… the dreadful happened!

The stock listed 8 percent below its issue price at Rs 872. Fingers were pointed at the Reserve Bank of India. Investors said RBI’s sudden interest rate hike soured the mood and caused the listing to be at a discount. For the meme world, LIC was Baahubali, RBI was Katappa.

Since its listing, the stock has gone only downwards. It is set to end the year near Rs 690 level.

ITC

No list is complete without the OG meme stock – ITC. Since May 2019, investors had been waiting patiently to see the stock touch the Rs 300 mark again. And it finally happened in July 2022. Just like its many businesses ― cigarettes, FMCG, hotels, paper, agri ― the variety of memes was a sight to behold. From a turtle on a treadmill to a galloping bull, ITC was likened to several animals.

It is the second-best-performing Nifty stock of the year, with a 52 percent gain. If we go by what brokerages say, the stock is all set to puff more gains in 2023. For instance, Antique Stock Broking has a Rs 419 target on the stock. One can only imagine the hysteria that will follow once ITC crosses the Rs 400 mark!

Zomato

Zomato’s lock-in period ended on July 25 and the stock crashed to a record low, triggering a meme fest on social media. The most iconic meme was one comparing Zomato’s share price to the price of one kg of tomato. Currently, it is trading way below its issue price of Rs 76.

Zomato sure has an edge as it operates in a duopolistic market, believe analysts. But, its $570-million acquisition of Blinkit resulting in greater cash burn has not gone down well with investors. The company still has some way to go before it can dish out profits. Till then, social media will serve you some great memes. Keep watching the space!

Do share your favourite stock memes of the year with us! And here’s to hoping that 2023 has another laugh riot in store for us."

Hotelier-turned-fund manager Manu Rishi Guptha first dabbled in the stock market in 1993. His goal: More pocket money. Guptha was in college then. “I realised the kind of money that can be made from the stock market after I saw a picture of Harshad Mehta with his lavish car collection. He was the highest tax-payer at the time,” Guptha said in an interview with Moneycontrol.

With two of his friends, he launched a small fund in college, pooling in money from classmates, teachers and family members. In 2.5 years, the fund managed to double everyone’s investments, he claims. Unilever, Pooja Granites, Sunku Auto, and Citicorp Securities were some of the stocks they invested in.

After 25 years in the hospitality industry, Guptha is back in the portfolio management service industry. His fund MRG Capital, incepted in 2019, has a little under Rs 100 crore in assets under management (AUM) and the top holdings include Infosys, ICICI Securities and Tata Chemicals. Edited excerpts from the interview:

What is your current market outlook? Do you believe the Indian markets are overvalued?

Our markets are about two standard deviations above the long-term average. Look from a macro-economic perspective. There's a war raging on with uncertainty in oil prices, there’s churn in fiat currencies, and volatility in the dollar index. In the US, the yield curve has not been as inverted in the last 40 years as it is now. There are a lot of unknown variables in the global stock markets and a bad news might come any time soon.

So, are you sitting on cash right now?

Yes. Overall, we are sitting on 10-15 percent cash. But in some accounts, we are almost 80 percent in cash. These are clients who joined us in the last six months.

You don’t believe India has decoupled from the global markets, do you?

If India has truly decoupled, then why are we discussing US interest rates and Fed commentary every other day. So no, it has not decoupled. But, I believe, it can happen in the next 10 years. India’s young demographic and economic prospects give us 20-25 years of growth runway.

However, a robust equity market can only be sustained when there’s ease of doing business. And for that, contract enforcement is key. People need to be held accountable if contracts are not being honoured.

Last year, ITC had slapped a defamation lawsuit against you. It is the best-performing Nifty stock this year. Do you hold the stock in your portfolio?

I still hold a large chunk of ITC in my personal capacity. That allows me the opportunity to voice my concerns as a shareholder. However, MRG Capital has negligible quantity of ITC shares as a percentage of total assets.

What are these concerns (against ITC)?

I believe it's a great company. But the company’s long-term strategy and capital allocation policies leave much to be desired. As a shareholder, I hope that my logic and data-backed opinions help them put their house in order.

Their cigarettes business is a cash-generating machine. But most of this cash is being used in the FMCG and hotels businesses, where EBITDA margins are in single digits. Meanwhile, ITC's FMCG peers Britannia, HUL, and Nestle are operating at 20+ percent EBITDA margins. Similarly, IHCL, and Lemon Tree have ~40+ percent EBITDA margins.

ITC should stick to its core business and not destroy any more capital. I believe, the stock is overvalued right now.

What is the stock’s fair value at this point in time, in your view?

With its present EBITDA profile, the stock should trade at ~Rs 200 levels.

Why then do you still hold ITC ?

If the house is put in order, with serious changes being implemented in the near future and the elusive demerger of various subsidiaries done, the stock could go up to Rs 1,000 in four or five years.

Let’s talk about Infosys, the stock which has the highest weightage in your fund…

Infosys is still managed and very peripherally overseen by the founders. They still love their company. The company generates copious amounts of cash and gives out copious amounts of dividend. What more could a shareholder want?

After the 2017 Vishal Sikka crisis, I think, the stock plunged to Rs 700 apiece. Analysts said ‘Sell Infosys’. Instead I took a loan, leveraged myself and invested 30-40 percent of my wealth in the stock. Following that, there was a 1:1 bonus issue. Essentially, the stock has risen from Rs 350 apiece to Rs 1,600 in less than five years. Not bad, no?

Do you believe Infosys should be commanding a premium over TCS?

Of course, and there's a logic behind it. Since the last four or five quarters, Infosys’ profit margins are better, operational leverage is better, and cash pay-out to shareholders is better than TCS. There’s no reason why TCS should have a 4-5 percentage edge over Infosys, when it comes to P/E valuation.

A large part of Infosys’ revenue comes from its banking solutions software -- Finacle. Almost all banks in India and many banks world-over use it. Changing a vendor, in this case, becomes difficult. So, that’s where the stickiness of revenue comes from.

So, I don't see any existential threat in Infosys. But the second-best choice or an equally good choice would be TCS.

Tata Chemicals has the fourth-largest weightage in your fund. Of all the Tata companies, why this?

After TCS, Tata Chemicals has the healthiest balance sheet in the Tata group. The debt on Tata Steel and Tata Motors’ books will never allow me to buy those stocks.

Tata Chemicals is one of the biggest soda ash manufacturers. Soda ash is used in the making of soaps, glass and cement. Plus, they are expanding their capacity, and Tatas’ corporate governance is unmatched. It is a no-brainer stock, trading at 11 P/E. You can’t go wrong with that.

As a fund, we invested a large part when the stock was at Rs 350-400 level. Now, the stock is above Rs 1,000. Sometimes, you just need a boringly amazing company to keep doing what it does best.

So, at this point in time, do you still think Tata Chemicals is undervalued?

Well, it is reasonably valued. As and when soda ash prices spike, the company will clean up its balance sheet. I feel Tata Chemicals will be a Rs 3,000-stock in the next five years.

ICICI Securities is another heavyweight in your portfolio. What is the rationale for that?

Our fund has the biggest exposure in Infosys, ICICI Securities and Tata Chemicals. We keep juggling these three in our top holdings.

Coming back to ICICI Securities, there is no counterparty risk in the broking, investment banking and advisory business model.

Second, only 3-4 percent of the total population of India is invested in the stock market. In the US, 52 percent of the population is invested in the stock market in some form or the other. The potential to grow is immense. ICICI Securities is truly reliable for online initiation of first-timers in the stock market.

The company is into investment banking, it is underwriting IPOs, and it has a wide product portfolio. I believe, it has the potential to become the Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan of India. In other broking platforms, I see practices being followed that are not in regulatory compliance.

What about Zerodha?

If it was listed, it would have definitely been a part of my portfolio, because they too don't have a counterparty risk. They are purely into brokerage and lending. And, they have really grown very well.

Finally, do you have a Nifty target?

There are only two people who know the Nifty target. One is God. The other is a liar. No one knows where the markets will go.

Presently there is a ""phenomenal"" amount of inflation, hence FMCG volume growth in rural areas is ""muted"" and the bulk of the growth is inflation lead, he said in a panel discussion at an event organised by industry body CII.

When asked about the consumption trends, Puri said, ""In the FMCG segments, we are seeing both the trends of premiumization and at the same time there is a lot of value-seeking behaviour and stress at the lower price points."" However, he also said that presently India is ""much better"" than the rest of the world, witnessing high inflation.

""As far as consumption is concerned, the main stress point is inflation induced because prices of lots of products have gone up at a percentage probably in the prior period that would have taken five years to go up,"" Puri added.

However, Puri also added that rural demand is going to get better because realisations have been better and costs are up and as a net, it is ""better off"".

""There would be certain regions that are going to be more impacted and it is more to do with the distribution of rainfalls and the impact of the untimely rains. Certain areas would be under stress,"" he said adding ""Overall my assessment is that it is going to be better at time."" Puri also added that Inflation as far as FMCG is concerned is cooling off a little.

Besides, he also added that the macros for investment are ""pretty good"".

""If you look at the availability of funds, the corporate income, better balance sheets, all these are positive. Earnings also are on a better trajectory. The issue that really comes to is about capacity utilisation, which is also picking up. But there is a serious amount of global uncertainty,"" he said.

There are also serious headwinds on exports and that is going to dampen sentiments, Puri added.

""For companies like ours, which are domestically focused, private CAPEX is continuing. We have already done and some more is in the pipeline,"" he said.

Puri also added that a lot of policy interventions such as Gati Shakti and investment in infrastructure have been done by the government and many of them are ""absolutely in the right direction"".

These ""will certainly help us benefit from the opportunity that arises,"" he said adding though manufacturing is important, India has also to play to some other areas of strength since the demographics are a big strength for the country.

There is also a need to improve the income level and the country should look into sectors such as tourism, agriculture, and food processing, which could be ""economic multipliers"", he added."

Early-stage venture capital (VC) firm Unitus Ventures, on December 6, said it has on boarded ITC veteran Sanjiv Rangrass as a venture partner. The company said Rangrass will lead its investment strategy in the climate sector for the next fund that will be launched in early 2023. This comes at a time when investor interest in climate tech start-ups is growing rapidly

Rangrass spent 40 years at ITC, where he joined as a trainee and became the chief executive officer (CEO) of the company’s agri-business unit before retiring as its group head for research and development, sustainability and projects in June this year.

He is also an active investor and mentor, with an envious track record of making investments in unicorns such as Zetwerk, OfBusiness, and BlackBuck. Recently, Zetwerk inducted Rangrass on their board as an independent director.

“The world today stares at an 8 billion population where climate change is arguably the most important existential challenge it faces. These are early days and the sector has massive potential for innovative new companies to emerge, which will create millions of jobs and investor value while addressing the challenge at scale. I am looking forward to working with the team to establish Unitus as the leading climate investor in India” said Rangrass.

He has made investments in various agritech start-ups like Vegrow, Absolute Foods, Krishify, Farmart, Loopworm, and AgNext, to name a few. Rangrass also has climate-focused companies like Metastable Materials and Wastelink, in his investment portfolio.

“Rangy’s (as Sanjiv is fondly called) extensive experience in agritech and sustainability will form the anchor for our investment strategy in the Climate sector for our next Fund,” said Surya Mantha, managing partner, Unitus Ventures.

The VC firm said Raj Nooyi has also joined as Venture Advisor. Nooyi is a former executive of companies such as Hewlett Packard, PRTM, Tata Consultancy Services, and IBM where he led the design, development, and implementation of solutions to improve supply chains, accelerate product innovation, and effect organizational change at a global level, the VC firm said.

Raj Nooyi

“'Built in India, for the World' is becoming the mantra in several sectors, the most notable of which is SaaS (Software as a Service). A deep pool of technical talent coupled with a large and demanding domestic market has prepared Indian entrepreneurs and start-ups to compete with the very best companies globally. I am excited about helping Unitus' portfolio companies achieve international scale and success,” said Nooyi.

The company said Nooyi has also remained committed to social justice and international development and has been associated with non-profit organisations including Plan International where he served as the interim CEO.

Rebound in rural demand, easing inflationary pressures and recovery in margins bode well for consumer staple companies and could see them outperform discretionary stocks in H2FY23, foreign brokerage firm CLSA has said.

“We continue to see high base affecting growth for the discretionary names. On the other hand, staples stocks, on a low volume base in H2FY22 and with gradual easing in inflation, are placed well to report better earnings,” it said in a recent report.

In the December quarter last year, HUL, Colgate and Marico reported low single-digit volume growth, while discretionary companies like Varun Beverages, Asian Paints and Titan clocked a volume growth upwards of 20 percent.

As rural markets account for nearly 69 percent of India’s population, staple companies are now pinning hopes on volume recovery backed by a good harvest, higher minimum support prices (MSP) and an increase in fertiliser subsidy, which will leave consumers with more money to spend.

Around 58 percent of the total 751 rural respondents noted improvement in income over pre-Covid levels, said CLSA, citing its proprietary survey. Rural demand has rebounded in October and companies are hopeful of the momentum sustaining.

Discretionary companies, on the other hand, witnessed strong sales in October due to the festival season but the demand tapered off in November, the foreign brokerage firm said. “Discretionary companies are cautious on demand momentum,” it added.

CLSA’s preferred picks in consumer staples are Hindustan Unilever with a target price of Rs 2,950, Dabur with a target of Rs 625 and ITC Rs 375.

From August to November, ITC gained 10.6 percent, HUL 3.52 percent, Godrej Consumer was up 2.3 percent and Dabur gained 1.3 percent. Consumer discretionary stocks also gained in the same period. Varun Beverages was up 35 percent, Titan 11.7 percent and Pidilite gained 10 percent.

Motilal Oswal's research report on ITC

ITC’s sales growth momentum was better than expected across businesses in 2QFY23. Estimated Cigarette volume growth of 21% YoY was a positive surprise and resulted in a three-year volume CAGR of 5.1%. The higher-thanexpected contribution from the high-margin Cigarettes business resulted in a 250bp beat on our EBITDA margin estimates, which came in at 36.4%. As highlighted in our upgrade to Buy note as well as our FY22 annual report note, strong earnings momentum (18% EPS CAGR over FY22-FY24 v/s ~5% in the preceding five years) is being driven by healthy performance from Cigarettes in a stable tax environment, strong recovery in Hotels business profitability, and continued good performance of FMCG-Others. Allied with better capital allocation and continued healthy dividend payouts, the path towards high 20’s/early 30’s RoE is visible.

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

ITC posted yet another quarter of strong numbers in Q2FY2023 with revenues and PAT growing by 27% and 21% respectively. OPM stood flat at 36.4% despite inflationary pressures in the FMCG business. Cigarette business sales volumes grew by over 20%; non-cigarette FMCG business grew by 21%, Agri business registered strong growth of 44% and the paperboard, paper & packaging business grew by 25% y-o-y. We expect growth momentum in the cigarette sales volumes to sustain with government actions on curbing illicit cigarette sales. The hotels business is expected to post strong performance in H2 due to a strong business period. Non-cigarette FMCG revenues would grow in double digits while margins might improve sequentially in the coming quarters.

We increase our FY23/FY24/FY25 EPS by 3.2%/4.5%/4.5% and target price to Rs365 (Rs340 earlier) and maintain our Accumulate rating. ITC posted encouraging performance with ~20.5% cigarette volume growth and margin expansion across cigarettes, paperboard and hotels business. Near term outlook remains positive given 1) positive cigarette volume traction in a stable tax regime 2) strong pricing and benefits of back ward integration in Paper and paper board in near term 3) structural recovery with robust outlook in ARR and occupancy levels in Hotels and 4) sustained growth across segments in FMCG with margin expansion likely from 3Q/4Q23.

Outlook

While near term outlook is strong, we expect slowdown in growth post FY23 given high base of current year. ITC trades at 21.0x Dec’24 EPS with 11.8% EPS CAGR over FY22-25. We note ROE/ ROCE of 29%/38% and ~80%+ dividend payout are positives. We expect incremental returns to accrue in a more calibrated manner.

None. “The era of unidirectional bets is over,” said the market veteran at Moneycontrol’s Muhurat Roundtable.

“There is no 30-year bull market in bonds or 30-year price-to-earnings expansion. Similarly, no one sector is going to outperform because in a slow growth world, some sector will always gain at some other sector’s expense,” he explained.

To prove his point, Chokhani cited the rally in Coal India, Hindustan Aeronautics and ITC this year. Coal India has gained 54 percent, HAL is up 95 percent and ITC has advanced 57 percent in 2022 so far.

“These were among the most hated stocks. PSUs (public sector undertakings) like HAL and BEL, and anti-ESG companies like ITC and Coal India were not loved by investors. But these are the stocks that have given major returns,” he said.

“Even if you look at the automobile pack, one has lost money in Tata Motors this year but has almost doubled the wealth in TVS Motor. That’s a surprise. So I don't think there is a sectoral bet to be made,” Chokhani added.

In the last one year, the Tata group company has declined 17 percent while TVS Motor Company is up 90.5 percent.

Investors need to think like business owners. “There are businesses I like, businesses I understand, and if I like the price, I buy them,” he explained.

The D-Street veteran has largely been bullish on financials but “having said that, one has lost money in the much-loved Kotak Bank and HDFC Bank stocks in last year. Meanwhile, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and State Bank of India have made money for investors.”

Should investors bet on asset management companies?

Assets under management in the Indian mutual fund industry have grown from Rs 7.20 lakh crore as on September 30, 2012 to Rs 38.42 lakh crore as on September 30, 2022. That is a five-fold increase in a span of 10 years.

According to Chokhani, this is a sector worth betting on. “It's a listed space. It's the biggest consumption item in India. More than toothpaste, people will be eventually putting money into mutual funds,” he said.

HDFC AMC, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, NAM India are some of the listed AMCs in India.

“People hate them because they think the industry will fragment and become passive. Products will move towards ETFs or exchange-traded funds. But I don't think that's going to happen. If India is headed to $10 trillion GDP, our asset management companies cannot remain so small,” Chokhani said.

Investors just need to wait for the right price to invest, he advised.​"

Standalone revenue (excluding excise duty) came in higher at Rs 16,130 crore for the quarter, an increase of 26.6 percent over Rs 12,731 crore same time last year. Sequentially, the revenue is marginally lower by 6.7 percent from Rs 17,289 crore.

The company's Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation, or EBITDA jumped 27 percent YoY to Rs 5,863.7 crore from Rs 4,615 crore.

EBITDA margin improved marginally to 36.4 percent as against 36.3 percent YoY. This was much higher to what analysts had estimated at 34.3 percent.

Cigarettes

Segment revenue grew 23.3 percent YoY to Rs 6,954 crore. ""Stability in taxes, backed by deterrent actions by enforcement agencies, enable continued volume recovery from illicit trade,"" said the company.

The segment's recent launches continue to gain traction, with robust growth across regions and markets, it added. Sources told CNBC-TV18 that cigarette volume growth might be as high as 20 percent.

FMCG

Segment revenue jumped 21 percent YoY to Rs 4,885 crore. FMCG EBITDA margin improved 170 basis points sequentially at 9.5 percent.

Sharp escalation in input costs were mitigated through strategic cost management, premiumisation, supply chain agility and judicious pricing actions, informed the company.

Hotels

Segment revenue at Rs 535 crore, grew 81.9 percent YoY and 25.6 percent over Q2FY20. Average Room Rates (ARR) and occupancy levels are now ahead of pre-pandemic levels, ITC said in an exchange filing.

The company has a healthy pipeline of properties under Welcomhotel, Mementos, Storii and Fortune, with phased openings planned over the next few quarters.

Paperboards, Paper & Packaging

Segment revenue jumped 25 percent YoY to Rs 2,288 crore. This was on the back of strong demand across end-user segments and exports.

The company continues to scale up its sustainable products portfolio. Margin expansion to 27.5 percent was led by integrated business model, strategic investments and proactive capacity augmentation, said ITC.

Agri-Business

Segment revenue grew 44 percent YoY to Rs 3,997 crore driven by wheat, rice and leaf tobacco exports.

Multi conglomerate ITC Ltd has further invested Rs 13.50 crore in D2C baby care brand Mother Sparsh, which is in advanced discussions with other investors to raise Rs 90-100 crore in Series B funding.

The direct-to-consumer (D2C) brand on Wednesday said it is in advanced discussions with investors for securing Rs 90-100 crore in Series B funding, with ITC infusing Rs 13.5 crore in this.

ITC in a late-night regulatory filing on Tuesday said that after the deal, its shareholding in Mother Sparsh will go up from the existing 16 per cent to 22 per cent.

""The Company has entered into an agreement to acquire further 1,000 Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares of Rs 10 each of Mother Sparsh. The said shares, once acquired, will take the Company's shareholding in Mother Sparsh to 22 per cent,"" the filing said.

The acquisition is in line with the company's continued interest in the fast-growing D2C space in the personal care category, ITC added. In November last year, Mother Sparsh raised Series A funding from ITC.

Mother Sparsh, incorporated in February 2016, registered a turnover of Rs 33.53 crore in FY22. After Series B funding, the D2C brand intends to enhance its portfolio, especially across baby skin care and mother-oriented segment. It had recently forayed into the diaper segment.

""Mother Sparsh's objective behind the Series B funding round is to enhance R&D and foster innovation in the critical baby & mom care segment alongside sustained product portfolio diversification,"" it said.

Mother Sparsh co-founder and CEO Himanshu said: ""Our recurrent funding aims to strengthen this mission through R&D in the space and offering one-of-its-kind solutions for the needs of mothers and their little ones""."

The stock has been an analyst-favourite this year, advancing close to 52 percent so far. Data from Bloomberg shows that 34 analysts have a 'buy' call, three stayed with 'hold' and zero had 'sell' calls.

According to an average of estimates of brokerages polled by Moneycontrol, the company's revenue will rise 25.7 percent on-year to Rs 16,010 crore. Net profit is expected to grow 17.8 percent from the corresponding quarter of last fiscal to Rs 4,436 crore. Sequentially, the bottomline will expend 6.3 percent.

Analysts have pegged the EBITDA margin at 34.3 percent, which indicates a quarter-on-quarter improvement but a 200 basis point contraction on-year due to high inventory costs.

The growth in topline and bottomline has been attributed to healthy demand growth in ITC’s mainstay – cigarettes. Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal expects sales/EBITDA/adjusted net profit to grow 24.2 percent/16.1 percent/14.1 percent YoY respectively, backed by a 13 percent volume growth in cigarette demand.

Nuvama Research, Axis Securities and Kotak Institutional Equities expect cigarette volume growth of 15 percent, surpassing the pre-pandemic levels.

The company’s FMCG business is expected to see muted volume growth due to inflationary pressures. Uptick in FMCG revenues will largely be on the back of price hikes taken in earlier quarters to offset high raw material costs, according to analysts.

“In the FMCG segment (standalone), we estimate 12 percent on-year revenue growth implying 11.2 percent growth on a 3-year CAGR basis. This would be led by recovery in the stationery business and price increases,” said Kotak Institutional Equities in a note. The analysts at KIE have modelled a 50 bps QoQ increase in FMCG EBIT margin to 5.1 percent on a low base.

Also Read: Soaps are cheaper after price cuts. But what does it say about demand?

IDBI Capital, on the other hand, has more bullish targets. It expects the FMCG revenue to rise 22 percent YoY, while cigarette business to grow 20 percent.

Analysts expect full resumption of travel to benefit ITC’s hotels business. Revenue from the hotels segment is likely to jump 120 percent YoY, with EBIT margin of 16 percent. On the back of a favourable base, paperboards business is seen clocking in a revenue growth of 40 percent YoY while agri business topline is set to rise 60 percent YoY due to export demand.





Investors will be keenly watching out for:



Demand outlook for rural versus urban markets



Raw material pricing trends



Cigarette volume growth



Hotels and agri business outlook

Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) makers are expected to report strong revenue growth in the quarter ended September 2022, thanks to price hikes in the previous two quarters to offset input cost inflation.

For the 19 consumer companies under Motilal Oswal’s coverage, 16.7 percent growth is expected in revenue, 13.6 percent in Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and 12.9 percent in net profit.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects 17 percent revenue growth for Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), 15 percent for Britannia, 13 percent for Nestle and 12 percent for ITC’s FMCG business.

“Food and beverages categories should fare better than some home and personal care categories. We expect ITC, HUL, Britannia and Nestle to lead the pack,” Kotak Institutional Equities said.

Margins and volume growth

Revenue will expand, but margins will continue to be under pressure because of high-cost inventory. Analysts expect lower spot prices of raw materials to aid margins from the next quarter onwards.

“The prices of key commodities such as crude and palm oil have eased in the recent weeks, but they are unlikely to benefit margins in Q2FY23 as the decline came in only towards the end of the quarter,” Motilal Oswal said.

The full benefit of lower raw material prices is likely to come about only in H2FY23. Companies’ commentary on raw material prices, rural recovery and outlook for H2FY23, as the festive season kicks in, will be key to watch, Axis Securities said.

Volumes growth in most categories will be dented because of product weight reduction, high consumer inflation and a sustained slowdown in rural demand.

“Rural demand, which is 40-50 percent of industry demand, is reeling under burden of higher agri-input inflation. There are clear signs of downtrading across brands – hyperinflation in day-to-day essentials weighed on consumer disposable income,” Philip Capital said.

In its Q2FY23 update, Marico said its India business will record low single-digit volume growth. Dabur, too, warned of weak demand trends across categories in the quarter gone by.

Kotak Institutional Equities has pegged 4-8.5 percent domestic revenue growth with subdued volumes for Dabur, Godrej Consumer and Colgate.

For Marico, the securities firm expects 1.8 percent year-on-year domestic revenue growth on the back of low single-digit volume growth.

Paints and discretionary category

Asian Paints is expected to lead the paints pack with high double-digit growth. Axis Securities expects Asian Paints to deliver 32 percent year-on-year growth, driven by a combination of 12-13 percent volume growth, price hikes, market share gain, and expansion of the dealer network.

IDBI Capital expects Asian Paints’ revenue to grow 24 percent year-on-year. With prices of key raw materials such as crude and titanium dioxide decreasing by 16-17 percent on a sequential basis, the company’s EBITDA margin is expected to grow 500 basis points YoY to 18 percent. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

When it comes to QSRs (Quick Service Restaurants), Philip Capital expects 12 percent price-led same store sales growth for Jubilant Foodworks on account of 12-14 percent price hikes taken in the past year.

“Westlife Development shall see much better performance (+25 percent) versus Jubilant Foodworks due to higher share of dine-in (as consumers are facing fatigue towards delivery models)” the note added.

For United Spirits, Nuvama Research (earlier known as Edelweiss) expects revenue growth of 13.1 percent YoY while profits and margins will take a hit as higher priced inventory will show up in this quarter.

Meanwhile, United Breweries’ revenue growth is expected to slow sequentially due to the peak summer season in Q1FY23. High barley and glass bottle prices might impact gross margins of the company.

Analyst optimism lingered mostly around banks and financials as of September-end as credit growth peaked at as high as 16 percent and the condition of the Indian economy improved post-pandemic.

Data available with Bloomberg showed that most of the analyst optimism – measured as the percentage of analysts that have a ‘buy’ call on a stock – was centered around ICICI Bank, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and ITC among others.

ICICI Bank, which is one of the best performing bank stocks right now, has 52 ‘buy’ calls and just one ‘hold’ call, translating into an optimism score of 98 percent. The company has been delivering expectation-beating earnings for a while now and has become the apple of analysts’ eye. Analysts have praised its top-of-the-class net interest margins and investments into technology that is reaping rewards now.

L&T also has an optimism score of 98 percent with 40 ‘buy’ calls and a solitary ‘sell’ call. The stock is regarded as the best play on the infrastructure boom in India. The company is building some of the most important projects in the country including the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train project. It also has maintained its run rate of fresh orders resulting in revenue visibility, analysts underline.

Cigarette maker ITC is also one of analysts' top favourites with an optimism score of 97 percent. As many as 35 analysts are bullish on the stock with one analyst with a ‘hold’ call. The stock is also one of the best blue-chip performers of the current calendar year with returns of 51 percent.

Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and State Bank of India (SBI) are two more stocks in the financial space that have the same optimism score – 96 percent. HDFC – the largest mortgage lender in India – is in process of merging with HDFC Bank which analysts

believe will be value accretive. Hence, the stock has also attracted investors. Meanwhile, SBI which is the largest bank in the country is riding on a high credit growth phase and relatively cheaper valuations.

Two top life insurers – SBI Life Insurance and HDFC Life Insurance – are the next two stocks where optimism is high. Insurance penetration in India remains very low and it is likely to go up as awareness increases. Analysts are banking on this trend and are bullish on these stocks.

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, UPL, and NTPC are others in the top 10 where analysts are most bullish. Analysts believe Sun Pharma is likely to gain from ramping up sales in the US. It will also benefit from rupee depreciation. NTPC is investing heavily in new energy which will become another source of revenue for the firm and hence grabbed attention.

IT, metals continue to face flak

For another month, metals and IT sectors remained the pockets where analysts were not as bullish. JSW Steel, Wipro and Shree Cement were among the top stocks where the pessimism score was the highest. Pessimism score refers to the percentage of analysts that are not bullish on a stock.

JSW Steel, which is a victim of rich valuation and declining metal prices, has 17 ‘sell’ calls and 9 ‘hold’ calls compared to 7 ‘buy’ calls. The steelmaker is also likely to face a slowdown in export sales as western countries will be under recessionary pressure that will lead to fall in demand.

Wipro, along with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies, are IT stocks that are part of this list. IT companies, being export-facing, are also bearing the brunt of the slowdown in Europe and the US. Any recessionary phase leads to lesser tech spending and hence analysts have cut down their expectations.

Besides them, FMCG majors Britannia Industries and Nestle India are others that are seeing a concentration of pessimism. Both companies have been struggling with a slowdown in demand in rural India, which is likely to become even more challenging as kharif sowing has been lower than expectations. That means rural income is likely to be lower going ahead. Rich valuations of both stocks is also playing spoilsport for them.

FMCG companies such as Hindustan Unilever (HUL), ITC, Dabur, Marico, and Britannia are finally witnessing a much-needed fall in commodity prices, which have been a concern for the segment for more than a year now.

Crude oil is at a nine-quarter low, and has dropped 9.5 percent in the second quarter (Q2) of fiscal 2023 compared to Q1. “Crude oil prices are currently hovering at $88 per bbl (or per barrel), a 34 percent dip from the recent high of $134 / bbl in March, 2022,” said a note by Motilal Oswal.

Crude-linked derivatives such as linear alkyl benzene, light liquid paraffin (LLP), titanium dioxide, etc., are used as input in several non-food FMCG products. LLP, for instance, is a key raw material for skin and hair care products.

Similarly, the price of palm oil also has reduced substantially in Q2. At less than $800 / mt, palm oil, a key commodity for FMCG products, especially soaps, is at its 52-week low.

According to analysts, this bodes well for FMCG firms as their margins have been under stress for several quarters due to inflation, even as they struggle with a fall in consumption.

“Palm oil is a key input in soaps, biscuits, and noodles, and we expect HUL, Godrej Consumer Products (GCPL), Britannia, and Nestle to be key beneficiaries of this trend,” said Abneesh Roy, executive director, Edelweiss.

The full impact of the downtrend, however, would only be felt in the second half (H2) of the financial year, or Q3 onwards, said analysts.

“We expect 200 basis points expansion in gross margins in H2 vs H1 for the FMCG sector in FY23, and a strong FY24,” added Roy.

Motilal Oswal, too, expects a recovery in FMCG margins by Q3. “We expect gross margins to remain under pressure in the near term as companies are sitting on inventory purchased at higher costs, which will get consumed in the near term. Margins should start improving from 2HFY23, due to the dual effect of falling input costs and price hikes by the companies,” it said.

According to the brokerage, as input prices improve, companies can pass on the price benefit to consumers to spur demand.

Developments such as a rain deficit in states such as Uttar Pradesh (UP), Bihar, and West Bengal (WB), and depreciation of the rupee, could impact the sector and derail the benefits of declining commodity prices, said analysts.

“While the rainfall has been above average in India, it is below average in the northern belt, which is a key contributor to FMCG demand. Rural demand is not showing any signs of a pick-up. Cognisant of this situation, and supported by a moderation in commodity prices, companies may look to sharply roll back price hikes and launch various schemes to revive demand,” said Motilal Oswal.

The FMCG industry has been grappling with sky-high inflation in raw materials and several commodities for more than a year now. The price of crude oil, according to HUL, was up 60 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in the June quarter, while caustic soda was 125 percent costlier. The prices of two other key commodities — palm oil and polyethylene — were up 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively, year-on-year in the June quarter.

The companies have been passing on the cost increase to consumers, though cautiously, given the tepid demand scenario. In Q1, HUL raised the prices of some SKUs by 8-10 percent.

Other leading FMCG firms like Britannia, Nestle, Godrej Consumer Products, Tata Consumer Products, Dabur, and Marico have also raised prices consecutively for several quarters now."

Larsen and Toubro (L&T) was the only Nifty stock with every analyst holding a bullish view on it as of August-end, data available with Bloomberg shows. All 41 analysts tracking the stock advise buying it. ICICI Bank and ITC – two of the Street favourites in recent months given how much they have rallied – followed with all but one analyst having a ‘buy’ rating on them.

Since mid-June, L&T has rallied 31 percent. The company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the government's thrust on improving public infrastructure in the country. As of June-end, the consolidated order book of the group was at a record Rs 3,63,448 crore, with international orders having a share of 28 percent.

ICICI Bank, which is arguably the best performing large private bank, continues to hold a favourable position among analysts. Out of 53 analysts who track the stock, 52 have BUY calls while one has 'hold' call, the data shows. The stock has also delivered 27 percent since mid-June when the market had hit a recent low.

ITC, which is on a dream run since February, is the third most favourite stock among analysts with just one of 37 analysts having a 'hold' rating while others advising to 'buy' the stock. ITC is the cheapest available FMCG stock and the company has seen a strong growth in revenue. The outlook for its hotel, and paper businesses have also improved.

HDFC, which is in process to merge with HDFC Bank, and SBI are the next two stocks where analysts see value emerging. The former is the largest mortgage lender whose merger is likely to be value accretive, according to money managers and analysts. Whereas the latter is the largest banking entity in India that many analysts believe is undervalued. Both these stocks are also beneficiaries of increased credit growth in recent quarters.

SBI Life Insurance Co, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, UPL, NTPC and Apollo Hospitals Enterprise are the next five names where analysts are overwhelmingly positive.

SBI Life delivered strong growth in June quarter. Analysts say the company has diverse distribution network, has been investing in technology which provides a robust base to ensure steady growth. On the other hand, Sun Pharma is attracting analysts thanks to its growth in speciality segment. NTPC has been adding capacity in not just traditional sources but also in solar, which will likely to reap rewards going ahead.

Analysts are positive on Apollo Hospitals as they see its superior positioning in the pharmacy segment through and enhanced outlook for healthcare services segment to work for the stock.

IT remains out of favourJSW Steel continues to have a high number of 'sell' and 'hold' calls – 16 and 9, respectively – as analysts find it to be overvalued, especially given the diminishing growth avenues for the steel sector. International metal prices are down 30-40 percent from their peak, which means steel companies are getting lesser revenue on selling the same amount of steel.

Sector-wise, IT has the largest representation among those stocks where analysts are most pessimistic. As many as three names from the sector – Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services and HCL Technologies – are in the top 10 list. Analysts have turned cautious on the IT sector, fearing recession in their key western markets and declining margins for the last couple of quarters. Shares of IT companies have also seen heavy selling in recent months partly due to these reasons and in part due to global sell-off in technology stocks.

Similarly, analysts continue to be pessimistic about FMCG majors Britannia Industries and Nestle India. They believe them to be overvalued stocks. Both these firms have also struggled to grow in rural markets in recent quarters. Now the monsoon has been erratic, and with lower sowing rural income will likely be affected. This may add further to the woes of Britannia and Nestle in rural market.

Shree Cement and Asian Paints – two names serving the infra sector – have been facing declining margins, especially when raw material prices have been a concern. Though to be fair, some of these concerns have abated but analysts maintain their cautious stance on the stock.

Both names have also been facing pressure from new entrants in their respective industries, which may lead to lower margins for some time as competition will intensify, say analysts."

Discretionary segment has had no major impact from inflation as it sees good demand for all categories, said operating chief for ITC's chocolates, coffee, and confectionery segment.

""We are seeing quite a good demand materialising for all discretionary categories,"" Anuj Rustagi told CNBC-TV18.

""We are not yet seeing a major impact of inflation on the demand of the discretionary category,"" he added.

Going ahead, Rustagi expects robust demand to continue after double-digit growth clocked by the confectionary segment during Rakshabandhan and as people start to socialise ahead of the festive season and corporate gifting trends begin to take off.

By 2025, the chocolate confectionery market in India is forecast to reach $2.41 billion, increasing at a compound annual growth rate of 6.33 percent during 2020-2024. This is down from 12.11 percent CAGR during 2015-2019, according to marketresearch.com.

Rustagi said that they are expecting double-digit growth during the upcoming festive season.

"September 02, 2022 01:51 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/adani-transmission-dwarfs-market-giants-in-value-with-shares-surging-125-9121741.html,"Adani Transmission Ltd has blown past entrenched corporate giants to become India’s 10th-largest listed firm by market value as part of a broader runaway rally in Adani Group stocks.

Shares of the New Delhi-based power utility have climbed almost 125 percent this year, boosting its market capitalization to Rs 4.4 trillion ($55.2 billion) in Mumbai on Friday. Its valuation surpassed Life Insurance Corp. of India - the country’s largest insurer - and cigarettes-to-cookies maker ITC Ltd.

Adani Transmission’s pole-vault up the market capitalization table underpins the broader trend among Adani’s seven listed firms that have fueled a blistering $64 billion surge in the tycoon’s wealth. With shares of some of his firms gaining over 1,000 percent since the beginning of 2020, Adani has speedily emerged as the world’s third-richest person with a net worth of almost $141 billion, despite concerns by some analysts around his empire’s debt-fueled expansion and diversification.

There’s also a general sense of puzzlement around why the tycoon’s businesses are trading at far higher valuation ratios than local and global peers, seemingly beyond what their business prospects would justify. Adani Transmission is trading at more than 300 times its one-year forward earnings, making it the most expensive stock in the sector globally, including American Electric Power Company and Duke Energy Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

The utility firm’s shares may have been partially buoyed by investor hopes that the Indian government’s attempts to transform the country’s power sector will benefit the nation’s only pure-play, private-sector listed firm in this business. Adani Transmission will be a key beneficiary once changes in electricity distribution are implemented, Lavina Quadros, an analyst at Jefferies India Pvt., wrote in a note last month.

But those benefits from reforms are yet to trickle in. Adani Transmission reported a more than 15 percent drop in profit to 10 billion rupees for the year through March, while revenue surged 13.4 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Profit for the latest quarter ended June 30 also slipped 57 percent.

Some analysts question the sustainability of this rally across Adani Group firms.

“Among the biggest foreign investors in some Adani firms are a few Mauritius-based funds, having 95% of their assets in these companies,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategist Nitin Chanduka. “Such concentrated positions and negligible onshore ownership, could create asymmetric risk-reward for investors.”"

Raw-material inflation acted as a drag on margins of FMCG players in the first quarter of this fiscal.

Nearly all of them saw a year-on-year fall in operating profit margins, despite trying to pass on price hikes by shrinking packet sizes and raising the mark-up.

Operating profit margins of the biggest listed FMCG players dropped by an average of 258bps year on year; PAT margins fell by an average 197.87bps year on year.

Marico and Tata Consumer beat this sectoral trend though.

Marico’s EBITDA margin for this June quarter was 20.64%, which was slightly higher than last June quarter’s 19.05% and considerably more than this March quarter’s 16.01%. This was because of an unexpected dip in the price of copra, which accounts for half of its input costs.

Tata Consumer’s EBITDA margin went up year on year but fell quarter on quarter. Its yoy numbers are better despite rise in input costs and higher ad spends. Going by the press release from the company, their salt portfolio continues to grow at a healthy pace with double-digit, yoy increase this quarter too, despite its high base last June quarter. The premium salt portfolio recorded a 36% growth during the quarter. Its Kannan Devan tea brand has also reported “outstanding” growth because of brand building and on-ground execution.

Godrej Consumer seems to have had the deepest fall of 420 bps in EBITDA margin year on year; that said, the margin did go up quarter on quarter by 67 bps. The company’s sales volume declined by 5% yoy and its revenue growth of 8% was largely price led, which impacted demand. According to ICICI Securities, home improvement had a weak quarter and price increases in personal wash impacted offtake. “Margin trajectory further weakened (RM and also mix-led) but is likely to have bottomed out,” wrote the analysts. Its international business has weighed heavily on the margins too. While its India business’ operating profits fell by 4%, profits from international markets such as Indonesia and Africa fell by 34%.

Nestle and Emami saw the second and third-steepest fall in operating profit margins year on year, with 404 bps and 341 bps drops respectively. Nestle’s profitability was affected by elevated price levels of milk, green coffee and wheat. Analysts at ICICI Direct also think that higher freight cost due to sharp increase in fuel prices have affected the company’s bottom line. The analysts add that, with Nestle intent on growing its volumes, it is reluctant to pass on higher input costs to consumers. “Though, the company is undertaking cost rationalisation measures, the recovery is margins would come with considerable dip in commodity prices,” they wrote in a report.

Shrinking packages

High wheat and palm-oil prices were a drag on Britannia’s EBITDA margins, which fell to 13.7%, from 16.52% a year ago and 15.67 a quarter ago. A large portion of Britannia’s sales come from biscuits and high-protein food (70% of sales) and bread, cake and rusk contribute the second-largest share (18%).

Though their consolidated revenue went up by 9%, volumes fell by 2% yoy, possibly because of the sharp price increases of around 11% yoy they took, according to Nomura. “Sharp price increases of c.11%, driven two-thirds by grammage cuts in convenience price-point packs (c.50-50% of volumes and c.40% value) and one-third from MRP increases weighed on volumes,” stated its report.

Colgate has been trying to be more margin focussed over the last few quarters, according to ICICI Securities. After posting healthy margins for the last many quarters, the company’s EBITDA margin hit a 9-month low this June quarter, their report added.

Inflationary inputs, especially of packaging material, and an adverse product mix dragged down the margins, according to the analysts.

These are the two factors that put pressure on Dabur’s margins too. The company’s operating margin fell to 19.26% from 21.14% a year ago (rose from 18.01% a quarter ago). The product mix was adverse because the share of foods went up and that of healthcare declined, according to a Jefferies report. According to the brokerage, half of the gross margin decline (around 100 bps) was because of the adverse mix.

While the company did manage to pass on higher costs to consumers by increasing prices by 5% and decreasing grammage by 1%, inflation in the basket was higher at 9%.

Heavy ad spends

Advertising spends shot up for HUL in this quarter, by 30% year on year. It was Rs 1,328 crore in Q1FY23 versus Rs 1,024 crore in Q1FY22. This was because of the new product launches, according to a Nomura report. The second-highest expenditure on its books was for materials, which saw a 27.2% rise year on year. It was Rs 7,514 crore in Q1FY23 versus Rs 5,905 crore in Q1FY22. The brokerage expects the second quarter margins to contract sequentially too, because the company has high-price inventory, and stated in its report that only in the third quarter will softening prices of inputs start to improve margins.

The segment that delivered the largest share of EBITDA margin (29% of the margin) was Beauty and Personal Care. But, its profitability shrunk year on year–with the EBITDA margin falling by 184bps, to 26.3% from 28.1%. The company posted strong sales numbers in soaps and hair care, but its mass-consumption portfolio with Glow & Lovely and Talc and Colour Cosmetics are still selling at pre-Covid levels because consumers picked essentials/staples in the face of inflation, said the report.

The numbers were led by their paperboards and hotels business, and slightly better-than-expected cigarettes business, according to Jefferies. The company’s FMCG vertical reported healthy growth in revenues too, up 20% yoy thanks to schools reopening, demand for out-of-home goods keeping up and “a decent show in staples and convenience foods”.

Motilal Oswal's research report on ITC

Sales growth momentum was better than expected across businesses in 1QFY23. Barring the Agri business, where the ban on wheat exports may result in relatively muted growth in subsequent quarters, momentum in other businesses is expected to remain robust. As highlighted in our upgrade to Buy note as well as our FY22 annual report note, strong earnings momentum (16% EPS CAGR over FY22-24 v/s ~5% in the preceding five years) is being led by good performance from Cigarettes in a stable tax environment, healthy recovery in profitability for the Hotels business, and continued good performance from FMCG-Others. Unlike peers, pressure on material costs is far lower. Allied with better capital allocation and continued healthy dividend payout, the path towards high 20s or early 30s RoE is visible. We maintain our Buy rating.



Outlook

We maintain our earlier assigned 21x EPS multiple, a 65% premium to its global peer average, and roll forward to Jun’24 earnings The stock has done well, with gains of ~17% since our upgrade to Buy in Jun’22. We see scope for further upside, based on a healthy earnings outlook. We maintain our Buy rating.

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

ITC posted yet another quarter of strong financials in Q1FY2023 with revenues growing by over 40% y-o-y largely led by strong double-digit growth across categories. EBITDA margins sustained y-o-y despite inflationary pressures in the FMCG business. Cigarette business sales volumes grew by 25-26%; non-cigarette FMCG business grew by ~20%, Agri business registered strong growth of 82.7% and paperboard, paper & packaging business grew by 43.3%y-o-y. We expect growth momentum in cigarette sales volumes to sustain with government actions on curbing illicit cigarette sales. Hotels business will maintain strong growth momentum due to higher demand for domestic leisure travel. Non-cigarette FMCG revenues would grow in double digits while margins might improve sequentially in the coming quarters.



Outlook

ITC’s stock price has run-up by 19% in the past three months and is currently trading at 20.8x/18.0x its FY2023E/24E earnings. We maintain Buy with revised PT of Rs. 350.

(Photo by maitree rimthong/Pexels)

Bank stocks continue to enjoy the most optimism—or maximum buy calls—from sell-side analysts in July, with the sectoral outlook improving on rising interest rates, expectations of higher credit growth and lower non-performing assets (NPAs).

All the analysts covering HDFC Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) retained their ‘buy’ call from June, but one analyst among the 51 analysts covering ICICI Bank placed a ‘hold’ call on the stock.

“The banking names were always doing well but the key variable that has changed is the Fed (US Federal Reserve) narrative. The Fed’s 75 bps (basis points) hike was read by the market to be a quite benign commentary on inflation. This basically lifted sentiment across the board, including emerging markets, and this is leading to a follow-through buying of the banking sector. Secondly, there is a positive surprise on the gross and net NPA numbers, which is lifting some of the PSU banks as well,” said Harendra Kumar, managing director of institutional equities at Elara Capital.

Infrastructure sector leader Larsen & Toubro came fourth on the optimism chart, with nearly all analysts giving it a buy and the one exception in Ambit Capital pegging it for a ‘sell’. The positive sentiment towards the stock was driven by the company’s strong order book both for the domestic and international markets, its diversification into new businesses such as hydrogen and green EPC, and good working capital management.

Healthy sales in specialty generics and opportunity in the domestic and emerging markets are making Sun Pharma look good, and 93 percent of the analysts (41 out of 44) covering the stock are giving it a ‘buy’ call. While most experts are optimistic about the stock citing the company’s minimal reliance on the US market, Goldman Sachs has given a ‘sell’ call on concern about price erosion in that market.

Optimism around agrochemicals player UPL may be driven by sector dynamics such as higher food prices in the international market and fertiliser subsidies. Then there are company-specific pluses too, such as new product launches and strong growth in its international business. One concern was its lower working-capital efficiency, with inventory build-up and receivables, but the management expressed confidence about keeping net working capital days at 80, which has been the average since FY21.

Strong demand recovery for power is helping all stocks in that sector, and NTPC is riding that wave. But there are other company-specific drivers as well. According to Kumar, the triggers include capacity additions, stable return on equity and rerating because of the renewable play. “It has now become a growth stock rather than utility stock,” he said.

Apollo Hospitals is seeing optimism on account of its market share gains and healthy cash flows that can fund its promising digital expansion; Hindalco continues to be a favourite because of its transformation into a provider of value-added products such as aluminium plates for electric vehicle batteries and its reduced dependence on London Metal Exchange price volatility; and ITC has impressed market commentators with its cigarette sales, which also came from reclaiming a slice of the pie from the grey market, and its impressive numbers in hotels and agribusiness.

Most upgrades over one yearGrasim continues to see the maximum rise in upgrades over the past year this month too. Buy calls went up by 30 percent (9 of 10 from 6 out of 10 a year ago). Analysts are optimistic about its foray into new business segments that have adjacencies with its core business, such as paints and a B2B e-commerce platform for building materials. The latter requires a capex spend of Rs 2,000 crore, which has already been approved by the management, and analysts see this as an opportunity for the company to diversify further into associated segments.

Eicher retains the second spot this month too. The share of buy calls on the share has gone up 20 percent year-on-year. That is, a year ago, 45 percent of analysts covering Eicher gave it a buy call. This July, this has gone up to 65 percent. The company is largely riding on domestic sales going up.

Titan is a new entrant in this category and has seen a 19.45 percent increase in buy calls over the last year. Its strong sales numbers for the June quarter, which was a 205 percent increase over the previous year; rising demand for jewellery, especially in the festive season; and people moving to branded jewellery gave confidence to analysts.

Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki seem to be riding the general upbeat attitude to the auto sector, with demand improving and the shortage of semiconductors easing. The first saw the number of buy calls rise 19.45 percent (22 out of 31 analysts this year versus 17 out of 33 last year) and the second saw a rise of 17.47 percent (40 out of 53 analysts this year versus 29 out of 50 last year). Sell calls on Maruti were down from 12 to 7 this year. “The outlook for auto has improved after a few years because volumes are better, the semiconductor supply is easing, new product launches are doing well and the festive season is coming,” said Elara’s Kumar. He believes that the sector will see 18 months of secular growth now.

Strong loan growth, improvement in its interest rate margins, and a strong digital push seem to be driving the upgrades—16.67 percent on-year rise—for Bajaj Finance. The stock had 19 buy recommendations, 6 holds and 5 sells. Its parent company Bajaj Finserv was also among the stocks that saw maximum upgrades—a 16.36 percent increase over last year—again on the back of great results and the stock split announcement that was welcomed by shareholders.

A record increase in operating profits and net profit—63 percent and 41 percent on an annualised basis—in the June quarter could have lifted analysts’ outlook on Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). It saw a 12.82 percent increase in upgrades (with 31 out of 39 analysts giving a buy call versus 24 out of 36 last year). The company’s performance was driven by its oil-to-chemicals (OTC) business and high gross refining margins (GRMs). Cash flow from this segment of the business can help the company invest in its green-energy segment too, and the latter is seeing some positive commentary from analysts as well.

Maximum upgrades over last quarterITC led the pack with a 14.5 percent rise in share of upgrades. Thirty-three analysts gave this stock a buy call, while only 3 gave a hold call and none a sell. Last quarter, 27 analysts had rated it a ‘buy’, 7 ‘hold’ and one had ‘sell’.

Infosys also saw upgrades rise over last quarter, though the sector margins were under pressure. Nomura, which has a buy call on the stock, said that it prefers the stock over Tata Consultancy Services in large-caps because of Infosys’ “ongoing superior revenue growth profile”. CLSA, which too has a buy rating, said, “Large deal wins were modest but new business share has improved.” It added that all negatives have been priced in.

But Kumar believes that upgrades in the tech sector are a bit premature. “The outlook on the US economy is still hazy. We are likely to see some gyrations before they settle down to a level that is more believable,” he said.

Maximum upgrades over last month

Over the last month, sentiment towards RIL, Infosys and Nestle India seems to have improved because the three companies have moved up with their share of upgrades rising.

RIL’s upgrades went up by 10.3 percent on a monthly basis, Infosys’ by 5.8 percent and Nestle India’s by 5.6 percent.

Asian Paints came fourth with a 5 percent increase in upgrades over last month, with 19 analysts giving it a buy call versus 17 a month ago. Analysts believe that despite concerns about rising competition, the company will benefit from its strong position in the decorative-paints category, ability to take price hikes and improve margins from operating efficiencies, and expansion into home decor.

The push for clean energy, which involves considerable investment in transmission, and asset monetisation that could give good dividend yields could be what is driving the positive sentiment for PowerGrid. Twenty-two out of 27 analysts who rated the stock had a buy rating.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC posted encouraging performance with ~26% cigarette volume growth and margin expansion across cigarettes, paperboard and hotels business. Near term outlook remains positive given 1) positive cigarette volume traction in a stable tax regime 2) strong pricing and benefits of back ward integration in paper board in near term 3) sequentially improving ARR and occupancy levels in Hotels and 4) sustained growth across segments in FMCG with margin expansion likely from 3Q23. Although we expect another quarter of margin pressure in FMCG, strong traction in other businesses will enable ITC to sustain double digit profit growth. ITC trades at 21.0x FY24 EPS with 10.1% EPS CAGR over FY22-24. We note ROE/ ROCE of 27%/33% and ~80%+ dividend payout are positives. We expect incremental returns to accrue in a more calibrated manner. Any punitive increase in cigarette taxes is a key risk to our call.



Outlook

We increase our FY23 EPS by 5.3% and target price to Rs327 (Rs305 earlier) even as we cut rating from Buy to Accumulate post 50% return and significant outperformance to consumer universe in past 12 months.

Here is what brokerages have to say about stock and the company post June quarter earnings

Morgan Stanley

The foreign research firm has kept 'overweight' rating on the stock and raised the target price to Rs 330 per share.

The top-line and EBITDA was ahead of estimates led by strong growth in paper, agriculture business.. However, cigarettes performance was in-line with expectations.

The strong results and positive near-term earnings drivers augur well for stock, reported CNBC-TV18.

CLSA

Brokerage house CLSA has maintained 'outperform' rating on the stock and raised the target price to Rs 330 per share.

The recovery in mobility helps strong recovery in revenue and margin, while the cigarettes business registered 25 percent volume growth with margin stable at 74 percent.

The other FMCG staged healthy growth and stable margin, while non-FMCG stages sharp recovery, said CLSA.

It is preferred pick of CLSA and it raises FY23-24 earnings estimates by 8% to capture recovery, reported CNBC-TV18.

Motilal Oswal

We have turned constructive on the stock, led by: (a) a better-than-expected demand recovery and a healthy margin outlook in cigarettes, (b) robust sales momentum in the FMCG business, (c) lower drag from the Hotels business, and (d) better capital allocation in recent years.

While valuations of global Tobacco peers have returned to pre-COVID levels (Jan'19), at 18.8x FY24 EPS, ITC still trades at a 26 percent discount to its January 2019 valuations of 25.4x one-year forward EPS.

We maintain our earlier assigned 21x EPS multiple, a 65 percent premium to its global peer average, and roll forward to June 2024 earnings. The stock has done well, with gains of 17 percent since our upgrade to buy in June 2022. We see scope for further upside, based on a healthy earnings outlook. We maintain our 'buy' rating.

Sharekhan

With no price hikes in the near term and government action on curbing illicit cigarette will help ITC to maintain volume growth momentum in the cigarette business.

Strong growth in non-cigarette FMCG business, recovery in the hotel business and sustained strong growth in the PPP business will drive double-digit revenue and PAT growth over the next two years.

Strong earnings visibility with improving growth prospects of core cigarette business and margin expansion in non-cigarette FMCG business, along with a high cash generation ability and strong dividend payout will reduce valuation gap in the coming years. We maintain a Buy on the stock with a revised price target of Rs 350.

At 9:18am, ITC was quoting at Rs 312.85, up Rs 5.30, or 1.72 percent on the BSE.

Shares of diversified conglomerate ITC were trading marginally higher in the morning trade on August 1, as traders were cautious ahead of the company’s June quarter earnings announcement.

The stock was up 0.45 percent at Rs 304.30. The stock is one of the best performing one in the current year with gains of 39 percent so far.

Yes Securities expects volume and value growth of 6 percent and 3 percent. It believes margins should improve sequentially. The broker is building in 10 percent year-on-year (YoY) revenue growth and 22 percent net profit growth for the quarter.

In the previous quarter, the company reported an 11.7 percent growth in consolidated net profit at Rs 4,196 crore, thanks to strong volume growth in the cigarette business. Revenue rose 15 percent.

Axis Securities is more bullish and expects the company to do much better than the previous quarter. It is penciling in a 20 percent YoY revenue growth and 37 percent net profit growth.

“We expect cigarette to grow by 10 percent YoY (6-7 percent volume), FMCG to grow at 7-8 percent (low to mid-volume growth) on weak consumer sentiments, hotels (strong demand), papers and agri (geopolitical crisis) to moderate albeit on higher base,” it said.

The broker said the EBITDA margins of ITC will likely expand 170 basis points on account of moderate inflation, operating leverage benefits (hotels, paper) and cost rationalisation.

The cigarette business is the cash cow for ITC, bringing in the lion's share of profits. Besides amid the rise in international wheat prices and plastic ban, many expect the company’s agri, hotel and paper business to have done well as well.

Sharekhan said cigarette business revenues are expected to increase by 23 percent YoY (largely volume-led growth). Non-cigarette FMCG business is expected to grow by 16 percent due to lower volume growth.

It expects the hotel business to grow 3.5 times YoY aided by higher mobility and pent-up demand. Agri and paper businesses are also expected to deliver over 20 percent YoY growth, according to the broker.

Analysts have identified these key things to watch out for in ITC's June quarter results:

-Demand outlook on rural vs urban,

-Competitive intensity;

-Raw material price trends

-Hotels and agri-business outlook

Non-durables companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) and ITC Ltd expect inflation to disrupt business for another quarter unless the monsoon revives the rural economy and spurs consumption. Top executives of both companies recently indicated that while the prices of some inputs have eased in June, those of several others remained elevated and were even at 10-year highs.

“There are some early signs of moderation but the situation is dynamic and we need to monitor it,” ITC chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri said while addressing a virtual press conference last week after announcing the results for the first quarter.

Puri indicated that the trajectory of cost increases is difficult to predict given the supply-side challenges and green inflation as agri-commodities are being diverted for biofuel.

“I sense that there will be some moderation as the signs show but inflation will remain at an elevated level as compared to the past,” he added.

HUL, another fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) giant, also expects inflation to persist for at least another quarter. According to the company’s management, the commodity markets have inflated further sequentially in the June quarter and prices of most commodities are at very high levels.

“While the correction in some commodities like palm oil happened in the end weeks of June, we had already secured our inventory and incurred high costs on it,” said Ritesh Tiwari, executive director of finance and chief financial officer, HUL.

“Due to consumption of this inventory (in Q2) and many other commodities like crude oil, caustic soda and plastics, whose prices remain elevated, our September quarter net material inflation will be higher than June quarter,” he added.

The price of crude oil, according to HUL, was up 60 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) in the June quarter, while caustic soda was 125 percent costlier. The prices of two other key commodities—palm oil and polyethylene—were up 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively, y-o-y in the June quarter.

Margins to remain impacted

Given the challenges the inflationary trend pose, margins of these companies will remain under pressure in the coming quarters, indicated HUL and analysts. FMCG companies for several quarters now have been struggling with dented margins as inflation kicked up costs but a tepid demand scenario made it difficult to pass on the increase to consumers. HUL’s gross margins and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins for the quarter gone by were down by 327 basis points and 110 basis points, respectively. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.

“In the June quarter, the net material inflation was about 20 percent of our total cost. In the September quarter, the impact on the books would be based on the inventory that we have booked already and if the prices taper down going ahead, then we will see an impact coming in our books from the December quarter onwards,” Sanjiv Mehta, CEO and MD, HUL, said last week.

HUL’s top management has indicated that the second quarter will see more inflation than the first quarter and margins will remain under pressure and softening of some commodity prices will positively impact sequential margins from the third quarter onwards.

Eye on the monsoon

FMCG companies are now relying on a good monsoon now, which they hope will revive the rural economy, a big catchment area for these firms. Demand has been tepid for several quarters cityside as well.

The annual rainfall season, however, so far has remained below expectations in some parts. “There are still pockets of the country, especially, the central belt, where the monsoon has not been good so far. But if it covers up, going ahead then it will be one good factor,” said Mehta.

According to data from analytics firm Nielsen, sales volumes of the FMCG segment fell 5 percent in the quarter gone by. While value growth came in at 7 percent for the first quarter of FY23, it was, however, mostly price-led. While the urban segment is faring slightly better than rural India, indicated an industry executive, when seen over a three-year period, the volume growth of both segments has been flat.

Government initiatives such as fertiliser subsidy should also benefit the economy and help the country out of this crisis, said HUL’s Mehta.

On his part, Puri of ITC indicated that better realisations by farmers can help revive the economy."
"July 21, 2022 03:18 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/hotel-business-de-merger-very-much-on-table-itc-chief-sanjiv-puri-8863721.html,"Cigarettes-to-hotels conglomerate ITC is considering a de-merger of its hotel business, the company’s chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri said at a press conference on July 21.

“We had shared plans about an alternate structure for the hotel business before the pandemic, however, with COVID-19 we had to hold it back,” Puri said.

“We have reiterated in the annual report and the AGM that we will take ahead the plan in line with industry recovery dynamics. And now that there are indications of industry on a positive trajectory, it is very much on the table,” he added.

ITC runs 113 properties under its hotel business. It launched 9 hotels in FY22 and has a healthy pipeline of new properties which will be opened over the next few quarters, said Puri while speaking at the company’s 111th Annual General (AGM) on July 20.

While the business had taken a hard blow due to the pandemic, with life returning to normal it is on the path to recovery. Puri indicated as much while speaking at the AGM.

“Undoubtedly, the last two years have been the most challenging for the travel and hospitality sector worldwide. Your company's hotels business responded with commendable agility to tap alternate customer cohorts and garner new revenue streams,” he said.

“The segment revenue for the year doubled whilst segment PBIT turned positive in the second half of FY22. The resurgent trend in domestic tourism, MICE and banqueting highlight the immense opportunities for trusted brands like ITC Hotels in a post-pandemic era,” added Puri.

Besides the hotel business, the chairman also indicated a ‘possible listing’ of the IT business under ITC Infotech and said the company is evaluating the plan.

The company is also giving a major push to its recently launched app for farmers — ITCMAARS.

Bid to tap agri value chain

With the launch of ITCMAARS app, ITC aims to equip farmers with the latest information and technology, which will help them better their yields and ultimately raise their income. The digital platform provides farmers with AI/ML driven value-added personalised and hyperlocal crop advisories. These include a customised ‘crop calendar’ for scientific planning of crop cycles, a ‘crop Doctor’ function for real-time resolution of crop infestation, access to good quality inputs and market linkages, real-time soil testing, precision farming and so on.

The app will also connect the farmer with farmer producer organisations (FPOs), and companies and offer them services such as loans. The company, indicated Puri, will also look at onboarding insurance and other offerings on the app later.

""The newly launched super-app ITCMAARS is designed to provide maximum support to marginal farmers at their doorsteps, to give them the benefits of the best in technology and access to markets. For me, ITC MAARS will be a success when it makes a meaningful contribution to multiplying farmer incomes and making India’s agri value chains competitive,"" said Puri.

“There are about 140 million farmers in India and we need to bring them together to make an impact at scale,” he added.

The app will be free for use for the farmers, however, ITC plans to monetise it through service providers such as creditors, insurers etc. The app already had onboarded about 200 FPOs and over 40,000 farmers. ITCMAARS has now been launched in seven states.

“The aim is to have 10 million farmers and 4,000 FPOs,” the chairman shared.

An FPO or Farmer Producer Organisation is a voluntary collective of farmers.

NPD key for FMCG

The company, indicated Puri, will continue its high frequency of new product development (NPD) in the FMCG segment. Last year, ITC introduced 110 products in the FMCG segment under its brands like Aashirvaad, Sunfeast, Bingo and Yippee. ITC in FY22 extended its staples brand Aashirvaad to categories like organic foods, frozen breads and vermicelli, Sunfeast beyond biscuits to cakes and Savlon to surface disinfectant sprays.

“Today the consumer access points and the channels are getting transformed. And every channel has its own unique characteristics and unique consumer preferences emerge in these channels. So, some of the new products are meant to cater to the emerging channels. And hence launched will remain elevated over a period of time,” said Puri.

ITC is also now looking at aggressively expanding its FMCG portfolio to overseas markets.

“As we achieve scale for your company’s FMCG portfolio, it is also our aspiration to take these world-class brands to overseas markets. ITC has established distribution arrangements abroad enabling appreciable progress of exports of ITC’s brands to over 60 countries,” Puri said at the company’s AGM.

“Over time, such exports will make a substantial contribution to the growth of your company’s value-added FMCG portfolio.”"

Shares of ITC on Thursday hit Rs 300 mark for the first time since May 2019, surging over 10% so far in July amid hopes of better than expected earnings for June quarter. The stock has remained under performer for the last few years.

The stock hit a three year high of Rs 301.45 a share - a level last seen on 24 May 2019. At 10.15am, the scrip was trading at Rs 300 a share on BSE, up 1% from its previous close. So far this July the stock has increased over 10% while year to date it advanced 38%.

The firm has not announced the June quarter earnings date yet. However, 14 analysts of Bloomberg estimates, it will post a net profit of Rs 3985.90 crore while revenue will be at Rs 15093.70 crore.

The stock emerged as a good defensive play in volatile equity markets. Global stocks markets including India are under pressure due to higher inflation and expected monetary tightening by central banks. Analysts also fear a recession due to aggressive rate hikes by the US federal reserve.

However, analysts expect ITC to be least affected by the rural slowdown as its portfolio comprises mainly foods. The company offers the best inflation hedge as its core business is completely immune to inflation risk. Investors also bought the stock due to a stable tax regime for the second consecutive year. Analysts say this has given the firm flexibility to increase prices without disrupting demand. ""We expect this trend to continue and this should result in improved cigarette volumes and earnings visibility over the medium term"", Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note to investors.

Analysts said the agri-commodity business prospects have sharply improved post the Ukraine invasion and the IT vertical is expected to continue its strong double digit revenue growth with top percentile margins. Its other operations like hotels, paper and paperboards are likely to report strong earnings.

Brokerage firm Ventura Securities says strong growth across all business segments is expected to drive ITC’s overall revenues to Rs 86,678.6 crore (17.7% CAGR) over FY21-24E. EBITDA is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 15.9% to Rs26,513.4 crore while net profit is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 14.5% to Rs19,739.7 crore.

""While valuations of global Tobacco peers have been restored to their pre-pandemic levels (Jan’19), ITC still trades at a 24% discount to its Jan’19 valuation of 25.4x one-year forward EPS. We value ITC at 21x FY24E EPS, implying a 65% premium to its global peer average. We believe the premium multiples are justified, given its strong visibility over the medium term and the defensive nature of its business, especially in a volatile macro environment"", Motilal Oswal report added. The brokerage firm has maintained buy rating on the stock and increased its target price to Rs 335 a share."

Cigarettes-to-hotels conglomerate ITC, which has been strengthening its FMCG portfolio at home, is now looking at aggressively expanding it to overseas markets as well, chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri said at the company’s 111th annual general meeting (AGM) on July 20.

The home of popular brands like Aashirvaad, Sunfeast, Bingo and Yippee, ITC has gone big on its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business in recent years by launching new products, expanding distribution and entering new categories.

“As we achieve scale for your company’s FMCG portfolio, it is also our aspiration to take these world-class brands to overseas markets. ITC has established distribution arrangements abroad enabling appreciable progress of exports of ITC’s brands to over 60 countries,” Puri said.

“Over time, such exports will make a substantial contribution to the growth of your company’s value-added FMCG portfolio.”

Despite the challenging environment of the last two years, it clocked a 25 percent growth in its FMCG business (in the period, and reached a turnover of nearly Rs 16,000 crore in FY22, the company said.

“Despite the unprecedented inflationary headwinds, your company sustained EBITDA margins last year and also improved margins by 650 basis points over the last five years,” Puri said while addressing shareholders.

ITC launched 110 products in the FMCG segment in FY22 and the company has brands across staples, confectionaries, and ready-to-cook segments.

“The carefully selected portfolio, with substantial headroom to grow, is estimated to have a total addressable market potential of Rs 5,00,000 crore by 2030, which is amongst the highest in the Indian FMCG space,” said Puri.

Expanding portfolio

ITC, during the year, extended its staples brand Aashirvaad to categories like organic foods, frozen breads and vermicelli, Sunfeast beyond biscuits to cakes and Savlon to surface disinfectant sprays.

“ITC is also investing in categories of the future with some segments being progressively scaled up such as natural-action Nimyle floor cleaners and ITC Master Chef frozen snacks.

""We continue to incubate new engines of growth to create beachheads in areas that hold promise for the future. In addition, value-accretive acquisitions like Sunrise spices and investments in tech-enabled startups like Mother Sparsh and Mylo, in fast-evolving spaces like mother and childcare, will provide new vectors to accelerate growth,” Puri said.

During the year, ITC also expanded its distribution and its products were now available at 70 lakh outlets across the country.

Puri said the company’s traditional cigarettes business also recovered during the year and was now ahead of the pre-pandemic levels.

“To counter the menace of illegal cigarettes and reinforce market standing, your company will continue to fortify the product portfolio with focus on innovation, premiumisation and superior on-ground execution,” he added.

At 1.35 pm, ITC was trading 1.12 percent higher at Rs 297.90 on the National Stock Exchange."

Any fan of Sachin Tendulkar will remember the Nervous 90s – how everyone watching TV would start praying as soon as he scored 90, given his track record of getting out frequently before 100. A similar nervousness can be felt among investors in ITC shares.

The stock cruised from Rs 210 to Rs 290 over 87 sessions, shrugging off years of sluggishness and giving die-hard fans an I-told-you-so moment. However, it hasn’t been able to cross the Rs 300 mark, even after flirting with that level for 10 sessions now.

Over the past 2-3 years, the ITC stock has been known to rally and then retrace its steps, which is why investors are keeping their fingers crossed now.

It’s not as though the stock became expensive after a 41 percent rally since February. It’s still the cheapest consumer stock, trading at 23 times earnings compared with Hindustan Unilever and Godrej Consumer, which trade at upwards of 60 times. A high dividend yield also adds to its attractiveness.

ITC notched up sales of over Rs 65,000 crore in FY22 from diverse business verticals that include cigarettes, hotels, packaged foods, personal care, agri-business, paper and packaging, and information technology.

A breather

Fundamental analysts said investors should not read too much into ITC’s struggle around the Rs 300 level and consider it just a breather before the next leg of the rally. They said tailwinds for the stock are very strong.

ITC rallied this after the outlook for its agri-businesses improved amid a sharp rise in demand and prices for cereals and food grains across the world. Even though some commodity prices have come down, there are other factors working in favour of the stock, notably rising cigarette sales volumes.

The company said in its annual report that volumes for the cigarette business – which is its cash cow – surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the latter half of the previous financial year.

“We like ITC not only because it has started witnessing growth in cigarette volumes and profitability but also because of the possibility of demerger and value unlocking the potential for various businesses of ITC, including hospitality, FMCG, and IT,” said Nishit Master, portfolio manager at Axis Securities.

The company has not committed to demerging many of its asset-heavy businesses – as sought by investors – although it has said it is “certainly open to seeing what is right to create value for shareholders.”

Mohit Nigam, head - PMS, Hem Securities, lauded ITC’s financial performance in FY22, especially high cigarette volumes. Revenue from cigarettes rose 16 percent to Rs 26,158 crore in FY22.

“Stable tax environment in the cigarette segment would result in improved margins and volume growth of this segment. Also the stock has a dividend yield which attracts investors in this volatile interest rate environment,” he said.

ITC’s dividend for FY22 amounted to Rs 11.50 per share of Re 1 each.

Some of ITC’s asset-heavy businesses have started performing better. The outlook for its hotel business has improved after pandemic restrictions were lifted and tourism resumed in full flow.

The company said profit before interest and taxes from the hotel segment for the second half of the year turned positive against a loss of Rs 107.43 crore in the corresponding period a year earlier.

The paper and packaging business has also picked up amid the ban on single-use plastic and the reopening of schools and colleges.

One factor that went against ITC was the trend of investors avoiding companies that score low on ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance). ITC lagged in this aspect because of its tobacco business. However, opinions seem to be changing now.

“With the importance of ESG slightly diminishing among global investors, there is a high possibility of further foreign investor inflows in the stock, supporting the stock price movement upwards,” Master of Axis added.

Buy or sell?

Fundamental analysts are gung-ho about the ITC stock, with 31 ‘buy’ recommendations and four ‘hold’ calls as of June, according to Bloomberg data. Some technical analysts said it’s time to book profit.

“After a sharp move on the upside and testing the high point of 293.65, ITC has formed a large black candle,” said Milan Vaishnav, Founder of ChartWizard FZE (UAE) and Gemstone Equity Research and Advisory Services. “The occurrence of such a candle near the high point after a strong move on the upside may lead to formation of a potential top.”

He said for traders who are long on the stock, it is best advised to book and protect some profit and take money off the table. Those contemplating a fresh entry should go long only after the stock crosses Rs 300, he added.

Manish Shah, founder of Niftytriggers.com, said heavy buying recently pushed the stock’s 14-trading day relative strength index into an overbought zone.

“We frequently see price taking a pause once it hits an overbought zone. This is what is happening in ITC,” he said.

He said the moving averages are in a BUY mode and the price is trading above its resistance zone at Rs 280-285.

“Notwithstanding small corrective declines, the underlying current remains bullish. ITC remains in a strong uptrend and it is a matter of time before the rally resumes,” Shah said."

Nifty seems to be in a correction mode on the monthly chart. Since October 2021, the index has been in a gradual downward move. On weekly chart, Nifty is forming lower high, lower low pattern, indicating negative undertone of the index.

By looking at daily charts, we observed that the level of 15,930 has acted as a strong resistance since last 4 days, which is in sync with the gap which occurred on June 13, 2022 around the zone of 16,172–15,886.

On the downside, Nifty has a strong support at 15,367 (swing low) and 15,183 (low of June 2022).

We feel that the current trend in Nifty is rangebound between 15,930 and 15,367 but is negative-biased. If the Nifty breaches below 15,367 level then it will further down till 15,183 level.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Linde India: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,198 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,651 | Target: Rs 4,200 | Return: 31 percent

On weekly chart of Linde India, we can spot that the overall trend of the stock is positive as it is maintaining higher top, higher bottom pattern since February 2021.

Prices have shown a bounce back from the level around Rs 2,945, which is 38.2 percent retracement of its prior advance from the level Rs 885 (February 2021) till Rs 4,186 (April 2022). Around the same level (Rs 2,945) we witnessed a breakout of rounding bottom pattern in the month of March 2022 for which prices took 24 weeks to form and also we identified change in polarity of prices around this level.

Prices have taken support from the trendline which has been respecting since February 2021 and have shown closing above its 5 weeks high. The uptrend is followed by high volumes.

On indicator front, relative strength index (RSI) is above 50 on multiple time frames i.e Daily, Weekly and Monthly, indicating bullish momentum.

Going ahead, we expect the prices to move at higher levels towards Rs 4,000, post which we might see a move towards Rs 4,200 levels.

We recommend a stop-loss of Rs 2,651 on daily closing basis.

TVS Motor Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 842 | Stop-Loss: Rs 765 | Target: Rs 1,000 | Return: 19 percent

TVS Motor, on weekly chart, has shown a breakout from Cup & Handle pattern which has been forming since December 2017. The stock has also made fresh all-time high at Rs 850 in this week.

The stock has been forming bullish pattern of higher top higher bottom since last 7 weeks.

On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on higher time frames is above 50 mark and rising, which indicates bullish sentiment in the stock.

Going ahead, we might see the prices move higher towards Rs 1,000 mark. We recommend a strict stop-loss of Rs 765 on daily closing basis.

ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 273.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 250 | Target: Rs 350 | Return: 28 percent

In ITC, on weekly chart, we witnessed that prices are forming higher high, higher low formation. Prices have shown a bounce back from 20 weeks simple moving average (SMA), which acted as a variable support for the prices.

Around level of Rs 258, we can spot change in the polarity by the prices.

On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on weekly time frame we can spot positive reversal by the prices around over bought zone (70 mark) and the RSI is sustaining above 50 levels, this indicates a bullish sentiment in the stock.

We expect the stock to move higher towards Rs 320 levels and if it managed to cross above Rs 320 then eventually it will move towards Rs 350 levels. One should maintain a strict stop-loss of Rs 250 on daily closing basis for this trade.

"June 24, 2022 02:17 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/gst-council-may-consider-changes-in-monthly-gst-payment-form-8732991.html,"The GST Council in its meeting next week is likely to consider a proposal for making changes in the monthly tax payment form — GSTR-3B, which would include auto-population of outward supplies from sales return and non-editable tax payment table, officials said.

The move would help curb the menace of fake billing, whereby sellers would show higher sales in GSTR-1 to enable purchasers to claim input tax credit (ITC), but report suppressed sales in GSTR-3B to lower GST liability.

Currently, GSTR-3B of a taxpayer includes auto drafted input tax credit (ITC) statements based on inward and outward B2B supplies and also red flags any mismatch between GSTR-1 and 3B.

As per the changes proposed by the Law Committee of the GST Council, there will be auto-population of values from GTSR-1 into GSTR-3B in specific rows to establish one-to-one correspondence to a large extent between rows of the two return forms, thereby providing clarity to the taxpayer and tax officers.

The change would minimize the requirement of user input in GSTR-3B and ease the GSTR-3B filing process, an official said. The tax payment table in Form GSTR-3B will be auto-populated from other tables in the form and will be non-editable, as per the amended form recommended by the Law Committee of the Council.

Noting that amendment in Form GSTR-3B, as far as feasible, should flow from amendment in Form GSTR-1, with regard to outward liabilities, the Committee suggested that for giving more clarity to the taxpayers, separate amendment table (for liabilities) may be introduced in GSTR-3B, so that any amendment made in Form GSTR-1 gets reflected in GSTR-3B clearly.

Similarly, an amendment table may also be incorporated in GSTR-3B to show any amendment in the ITC portion, the Committee suggested. Once the changes proposed by the Law Committee gets an in-principle approval of the GST Council, the revamped form will be put in public domain for stakeholder consultation.

The GST Council in a meeting later will then approve the final form. Currently, taxpayers file statements of outward supplies in GSTR-1 by the 11th day of the subsequent month, while taxes are paid by filing GSTR-3B between 20th, 22nd and 24th of every month for different categories of taxpayers.

Commenting on the proposed changes in GSTR-3B, AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said tax filings are set to change for e-commerce operators rendering passenger transportation services, accommodation services, housekeeping services, and cloud kitchens.

Such e-commerce players would now be made liable to report supplies on behalf of suppliers in their GSTR -1 and GSTR-3B in separate cells.

”E-commerce players like Uber, Swiggy, Zomato and MMT would see few changes in monthly tax filings that will ensure more data points for the government system for big data analytics,” Mohan added."

In its annual report for 2021-22, the company also highlighted the need for policy interventions that are ""sharply focused on supporting sustainable livelihoods and fostering inclusive growth"" as the economy faces the immediate challenges of muted consumption, persistently high inflationary headwinds and supply chain disruptions.

The operating environment in FY22 remained ""extremely challenging"" and was marked by heightened uncertainty and volatility due to the COVID pandemic and unprecedented inflationary headwinds; geopolitical tensions towards the end of the year exacerbated the situation. The year also saw an unprecedented increase in prices of key inputs such as edible oils, packaging materials, soap noodles, fuel, logistics, etc. which exerted considerable pressure on margins.

The unprecedented increase in prices of key inputs was mitigated through focused cost management interventions across the value chain, premiumisation, product mix enrichment, judicious pricing actions and fiscal incentives, it added. During the year, ITC said the FMCG industry witnessed moderation in growth mainly due to subdued demand conditions especially in rural markets, high inflation eating into household budgets and high base effect in certain categories such as staples and convenience foods.

Health and hygiene, personal care products witnessed demand volatility in line with varying intensity of the pandemic, while remaining significantly above pre-pandemic levels. On the challenges ahead, the company said, ""Inflation continues to remain a key monitorable for your Company in the near term.""

The company continues to take proactive measures to counter the impact of such headwinds across all nodes of operations and deliver competitively superior performance leveraging its institutional strengths and harnessing advantages of scale, smart buying initiatives and world-class talent in a consumer-centric, agile and innovative manner, it said. On the macroeconomic front, ITC said up until January 2022, near-term prospects for the Indian economy seemed extremely promising with all sectors of the economy, including the contact-intensive service sector, having made a steady recovery.

""However, sustained inflationary headwinds and outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict leading to extended global disruptions and spiralling of commodity prices have led to downward revisions to the growth forecast for 2022,"" it said."

Warren Buffett famously said one should be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful. In the last couple of months, fear has been rising swiftly in the market. Time to get greedy?

A sharp fall in markets is usually a good opportunity to buy shares at cheaper valuations. Thanks to the recent selling, benchmark indices are down 18 percent from all their all-time highs. Stocks from broader markets have fared even worse, some are trading 50-80 percent down from their 52-week high.

Analysts, however, advise caution to those looking to buy and say avoid investing in one go. Staggered buying over the next few months is likely a good idea, analysts Moneycontrol talked to said.

They talked about multiple themes that can create wealth in the medium to long term and identified 19 stocks that are ripe for picking.

Auto in top gear

Akhilesh Jat, Category Manager-Equity Research, Capitalvia Global Research, recommended the auto sector that has outperformed the market in the calendar year 2022 after an underperformance of many years.

The recovery has been led by a growth in the sales of utility vehicles and commercial vehicles, given India is in the midst of revival after Covid 19 resulted in more vehicle usage, Jat said.

Timely and a normal monsoon and the government’s move to reduce steel prices are positive for auto stocks. High food prices favour farmers that may help revive tractors as well as two-wheeler demand in rural areas.

“Mahindra & Mahindra, Maruti Suzuki, and Tata Motors are the top stocks among the sectors in which one can invest,” Jat said.

Go defensive

Data shows one in four stocks listed on BSE is down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high. Nine in 10 stocks are down 20 percent from their 52-week highs.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, has a cautious view and said the volatile trend will continue in the short to medium-term because of the hawkish policy, which in the worst case can carry to H1CY23.

“Economy is expected to contract and corporate earnings to downgrade. During this phase, investment is suggested in stable entities, large and blue-chip companies with a focus on defensives,” Nair said.

His three recommendations are:

Dabur: Though margins pressure is expected in the short-term due to steep cost inflation, the impact is not significant for Dabur India, as a large part of raw material is non-crude and non-palm commodities. Increasing market share of the company on account of strong brand and distribution will support volumes, though steep inflation can impact overall consumer sentiments in the short term.

HDFC Bank: HDFC Banks future growth trajectory remains positive on lines of the merger prospects and resumption of digital operations. The recent correction along with its strong fundaments have made the bank an attractive investment avenue for long term investors.

Zydus Life Sciences: The company is supported by healthy growth pipeline for its niche products, competitive pricing, and an innovative and diversified portfolio which is in various stages of development. Nair expects earnings to grow at a healthy 16 percent CAGR over FY22-24.

The green sweetener

The other theme that is likely to benefit from market headwinds is the renewable energy. Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research, Ventura Securities, said oil and natural gas prices are high and estimated to remain at the current levels due to supply-side disruption, which will accelerate the investments in alternate fuels such as renewable energy and ethanol.

“We recommend Adani Green Energy, Adani Enterprises and NTPC in renewables, while Balrampur Chini, Triveni Engineering Industries, Dwarikesh Sugar and Shree Renuka Sugar in the sugar industry (as ethanol plays),” he said.

The global food shortage will significantly increase the demand for agri-commodities and therefore companies dealing in the agriculture supply chain such as ITC, Adani Wilmar and Uma Exports are expected to gain.

Similarly, some companies that operate in West Asia (Larsen & Toubro, Welspun Corp and DCM Shriram) are expected to get new businesses on the improving prospects for the region amid burgeoning oil prices.

Motilal Oswal's research report on ITC

Cigarette demand resilient: Demand was quick to recover to pre-pandemic levels after the second COVID wave. Our channel checks suggest that demand continues to remain robust. There has been relative stability with regard to taxes on Cigarettes in recent years. This has enabled ITC to calibrate its price increases to avoid disrupting demand, unlike the higher tax increase environment between FY13 and FY17. If not for the significant impact of the pandemic, we believe volume growth would have been 3-4% v/s 1-2% over the previous decade. With the intensity of further COVID-19 waves decreasing, we now expect a volume growth of 3-4% over the next couple of years, especially if the tax incidence remains benign. The Cigarette mix has been getting richer, aided by innovation, improved local manufacturing of capsule cigarettes, and better last-mile reach. With lower RM inflation and little evidence of downtrading so far, margin resilience is evidently superior to other Consumer categories.

Outlook

We value the stock at 21x FY24E EPS. We arrive at a TP of INR335 per share and upgrade our rating to Buy.

ITC share price edged higher intraday on June 16 after Motilal Oswal upgraded the stock to buy from neutral.

The domestic research and broking firm has a target of Rs 335 per share, an upside of 27 percent.

According to Motilal Oswal, better than expected demand recovery, healthy margin outlook on cigarettes, sales momentum in the FMCG business, lower drag from the hotels business, and better capital allocation in recent years have led to the upgrade.

""A stable tax environment for cigarettes in recent years has allowed ITC to calibrate price increases to avoid a disruption in demand. We expect this trend to continue and should result in improved cigarette volumes and earnings visibility over the medium term. The breadth of ITC’s FMCG product portfolio gives it an advantage in a rapidly changing demand environment. Its leadership position in some categories gives it pricing power to offset incremental input cost pressures in other categories, where pricing power is not as strong,"" it said.

""The resilient nature of its core business, amid an uncertain environment in the sector, and 4-5% dividend yield make the firm a good defensive bet in the ongoing volatile interest rate environment. Earnings CAGR (compound annual growth rate) at the profit before tax level stood at 5% over FY17-22. We expect ITC to post 15% earnings CAGR over FY22-24,"" it added.

Motilal Oswal values ITC at 21x FY24 earnings per share, a 65% premium to global peer average. It believes the premium multiples are justified, given its strong visibility over the medium term and the defensive nature of its business, especially in a volatile macro environment.

At 10:10 am, the stock was trading at Rs 265.30, up Rs 1.80, or 0.68 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 267.85 and an intraday low of Rs 264.75.

Home-grown conglomerate ITC has assigned its media and digital planning and buying duties to IPG Mediabrands. An agency executive has confirmed the development to Storyboard18.

A multi-agency pitch was called earlier this year. As part of the pitch, agencies had to present media handling and media buying strategies for television, print, outdoor, and digital. The Rs 600 crore-plus business has moved from GroupM’s Wavemaker. Wavemarker had been handling ITC’s media account since 2017. Madison, OMD, Publicis India are the other agencies that pitched for the account.

The Kolkata-based company owns multiple brands across its packaged foods, personal care, stationery, lifestyle retailing and safety matches and incense sticks categories. Brands like Aashirvaad, Bingo, Sunfeast, Engage, Fiama Di Wills, Vivel, Candyman, Yippee noodles, among others, are in ITC’s kitty.

The company is betting big on digital advertising innovation. Earlier this year, ITC’s Fabelle made its debut in the metaverse by being a part of two weddings hosted on the Yug Metaverse and the TardiVerse (metaverse wedding partner - CoinSwitch Kuber) platforms.

ITC reported an 11.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit at Rs 4,191 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31 due to strong growth across all operating segments. Consolidated revenue rose 15.3 percent on year to Rs 17,754 crore. Revenue from the cigarette business grew 9.96 percent while non-cigarette FMCG revenue was up 12.32 percent.

The company is also investing in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment to diversify its portfolios. In 2021, ITC picked a 16 percent stake in online-first mother and baby care Mother Sparsh brand for Rs 20 crore. In May this year, ITC acquired a 10.07 percent stake in Blupin Technologies Pvt. Ltd, the company behind D2C brand Mylo, for up to Rs 39.34 crore.

According to reports, by bringing on board these brands, the company plans to fill the gap between more mass market brands - that Indian packaged goods firms have spent years building - and premium goods."

(Image: Reuters)

Diversified entity ITC on Saturday said it has acquired a 10.07 per cent stake in Blupin Technologies Pvt Ltd, the company behind direct-to-consumer (D2C) brand, Mylo.

The FMCG major in April had announced the acquisition of a 10.07 per cent stake in Blupin Technologies Pvt Ltd, for up to Rs 39.34 crore.

""The Company has acquired today, i.e. on 28th May, 2022, 400 equity shares of 10/- each and 2,980 Compulsorily Convertible Cumulative Participating Preference Shares of 100/- each of Blupin Technologies Private Limited, representing 10.07% of its share capital on a fully diluted basis,"" ITC said in a regulatory filing.

The investment will provide the company an early mover advantage in the evolving content-to-community-to-commerce space and will provide an expanded presence in the D2C space, ITC said.

Blupin Technologies is a web and app-based content-to-community-to-commerce platform and offers mother and baby care products and services under the brand name ''Mylo''. It is focused on the parenting journey of young families, it had added."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC posted resilient performance with ~8.75% cigarette volume growth and margin expansion across Cigarettes, paperboard and FMCG business. Hotels improved however it still remains in the red. Near term outlook remains positive given 1) positive cigarette volume traction given stable tax regime 2) Strong pricing and benefits of backward integration in paper board 3) benefits of supply chain disruption in leaf tobacco and strong wheat exports 4) Gradually improving ARR and occupancy levels in Hotels and 5) Sustained growth across in core segments in FMCG with steady margin expansion. Although we expect near term margin pressure in FMCG, however strong traction in other businesses will enable ITC to sustain double digit profit growth. ITC trades at 18.2x FY24 EPS with 10% EPS CAGR over FY22-24. We note ROE/ ROCE of 27%/32% and ~80%+ dividend payout are positives.



Outlook

We increase valuation of cigarettes to 16x on improving growth and stable taxation (15x earlier) despite LT risks and assign higher multiples for FMCG and paper business. We increase SOTP based target price to Rs305 (Rs285 earlier) Maintain BUY.

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

ITC posted a resilient performance in Q4FY2022 with gross revenues growing by growing by 16% (net revenues grew by 16.8%) largely led by strong double-digit growth across categories. OPM sustained at 33.6% on y-o-y basis despite high raw material inflation. Cigarette business sales volumes grew by ~9%; non-cigarette FMCG business grew by 12% and Agri business registered strong growth of 30% in Q4. Cigarette sales volumes are set to improve further as government has not hiked taxes on cigarettes for second consecutive year. Non-cigarette FMCG biz would grow in high single digit to low double digit while paperboard, paper & packaging business would clock strong double-digit growth in the near term.



Outlook

ITC paid a dividend of Rs. 11.5 per share for FY2022 (dividend yield of 4.3%). The stock is currently trading at 18.0x/16.3x its FY2023/24E EPS. We maintain Buy with revised PT of Rs. 320.

Motilal Oswal's research report on ITC

ITC’s 4QFY22 EBITDA and PAT growth came in line with our estimates. Cigarette volumes reportedly rebounded to the pre-Covid levels and grew 9% YoY (calculated) in 4QFY22, above our estimate of 4% YoY. In the ongoing environment where material cost inflation is a worry, ITC’s resilient Cigarette margins render relatively better near-term visibility v/s peers. Longer term re-rating though will depend on diversification from cigarettes (81% of FY22 EBIT) and whether sustained earnings growth returns to the late-teen levels seen in the first half of the last decade.



Outlook

We maintain our Neutral rating on the stock with a TP of INR265.

YES Securities' research report on ITC

ITC delivered a solid performance with another quarter of robust growth in cigarette volumes (~9%) which surpassed pre-Covid levels and now seems on growth trajectory, a steady 12% growth in FMCG business despite a high base with sequential improvement in margins, hotels business turning around and above expected growth in both the Agri (29% growth) and paperboards (32% growth) businesses on a high base. We believe this sort of consistency across segments with some visible relief on the cigarette taxation front can drive a further re-rating on the valuations front. We expect normalized growth in cigarette volumes going forward driven by stability in taxes, progressive claw back of illicit industry and better growth rates and margins in FMCG, in addition to margin improvement in cigarettes with positive operating leverage and a better mix. Hotels business should improve steadily while paper business performance reinforces confidence in ITC’s ability to enhance competitiveness. We believe the cigarettes business deserves better valuation given positive volume growth expectations, improving geography and product mix and high ESG rankings. The FMCG business is growing well with acquisitions supporting the organic growth and margins moving up with scale. In other businesses, capital allocation concerns are being addressed with the peak capex cycle behind us, while the IT business can be another key value driver.



Outlook

We reiterate our BUY rating citing inexpensive valuations and a strong dividend yield. We reiterate our BUY rating with a revised TP of Rs 308 based on 20x FY24E earnings, a significant discount of ~50% to sector peers and a 15% discount to its own long-term average multiple. Any incremental tax increase or unrelated diversification remain the key risks while any corporate restructuring initiatives or value accretive FMCG acquisitions could provide positive triggers.

Vidnyan Sawant, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital

Since last seven weeks, the Nifty has been making lower top lower bottom formation and from previous five weeks, it has sustained below its 20 week SMA (simple moving average - 17,105) which shows bearish sentiments of the index. On the daily charts, the index has faced strong resistance at 16,400 levels since last 2 weeks indicating negative undertone of the market.

On the indicator front, the RSI (relative strength index) plotted on the weekly charts is sustaining below 40 mark which shows negative momentum.

The Nifty has immediate resistance placed at 16,400 and 16,800, followed by 17,105 levels. The downside support for the index is placed at 15,671 followed by 15,450 levels.

We feel that the Nifty is in a bearish mode. If the index breaches 15,671 levels, then it will move towards 15,450 mark in coming days. Our bearish view will be negated if it sustains above 17,105 levels.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Hindustan Aeronautics: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,685.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,540 | Target: Rs 1,895 | Return: 12 percent

HAL has been moving in a Higher Top Higher Bottom formation since March 2020 on the weekly charts indicating bullish undertone of the stock. The stock is strongly outperformed the broader market.

We witnessed a volume pick up at every rise in a stock price which shows bullish undertone of the stock. On the daily charts, the stock has formed CIP formation (Change in Polarity) near Rs 1,480 levels and sustained above 20 days SMA (Rs 1,608) indicating positive strength of the stock.

On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on the daily time frame has sustained above 60 mark with a higher top higher bottom pattern, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.

Going ahead, we expect prices to move at higher levels towards Rs 1,758, post which we might see a move towards Rs 1,895 levels. We recommend a stop-loss of Rs 1,540 on daily closing basis.

ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 275.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 252 | Target: Rs 322 | Return: 17 percent

ITC is giving a consolidation breakout which has been making since last six weeks and sustaining at multi-year high indicating positive undertone of the market. On the daily charts, the stock is forming big bullish candle with huge volume confirmation.

On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on all the time frame is sustaining above 60 levels which shows strong positive momentum.

Going ahead, we might see prices moving higher towards Rs 310 mark. If the prices manage to sustain above Rs 310 mark, we might see further up move towards Rs 322 level. We recommend a strict stop-loss of Rs 252 on daily closing basis.

MRPL: Buy | LTP: Rs 88.35 | Stop-Loss: Rs 68 | Target: Rs 115 | Return: 30 percent

Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) has bottomed out at Rs 40 levels with double bottom price formation and currently sustaining at multi-year high with strong volume support on the weekly charts.

On the daily charts, the stock has made CIP formation (Change in Polarity) at 68 levels. The stock is strongly outperformed the broader market.

The RSI indicator plotted on the weekly charts is moving upward and it is sustaining above 65 mark with the formation of higher low indicating strong positive momentum of the stock.

We expect the stock to move higher towards Rs 100 and if it managed to cross above Rs 110 then eventually it will move towards Rs 115 levels.

One should maintain a strict stop-loss of Rs 68 on daily closing basis for this trade.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after earnings:

Prabhudas Lilladher

ITC posted resilient performance with 8.75 percent cigarette volume growth and margin expansion across cigarettes, paperboard and FMCG business. Hotels improved but still remain in the red.

Near term outlook remains positive given, one, positive cigarette volume traction considering stable tax regime, two, strong pricing and benefits of backward integration in paperboard, three, benefits of supply chain disruption in leaf tobacco and strong wheat exports, four, gradually improving occupancy levels in hotels and, five, sustained growth across core segments in FMCG with steady margin expansion.

Although we expect near term margin pressure in FMCG, strong traction in other businesses will enable ITC to sustain double digit profit growth.

We increase the valuation of cigarettes to 16x on improving growth and stable taxation (versus 15x earlier) and assign higher multiples for FMCG and paper business. We increase SOTP (sum of the parts) based target price to Rs 305 (from Rs 285 earlier). Maintain buy.

Sharekhan

Cigarette sales volume are expected to improve in coming quarters. ITC has enhanced focus and redefined growth strategies for all business verticals to improve prospects in the medium to long term.

Strong earnings visibility with improving prospects of core cigarette business, margin expansion in non-cigarette FMCG business and a high cash generation ability with strong dividend payout (dividend yield of 4.3 percent in FY22) will reduce valuation gap in coming years.

We maintain buy on the stock with a revised price target of Rs 320.

Motilal Oswal

ITC’s re-rating would depend on sustained earnings growth going back to high-teens witnessed in the first half of the last decade (18 percent compound annual growth rate) which had slowed to 6.6 percent CAGR over the latter half. Valuation at 17x FY24, although cheap, appears fair.

We value ITC at a 15 percent premium over the global cigarette peer average, aiming for 17x FY24 earnings per share to arrive at our target price of Rs 265. Retain neutral.

Morgan Stanley

We maintain overweight rating on the stock and raise the target price to Rs 293 from Rs 276 as earnings were largely in line with estimates.

The cigarettes and FMCG earnings before interest and tax was ahead of estimates, while hotels and agriculture were weaker.

The strong results and positive near-term earnings augur well for the stock, CNBC-TV18 reported.

Jefferies

We maintain a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 305.

ITC has seen expanding margin, with smart gains in cigarettes and FMCG.

More than 20 percent growth in operating profit is a key positive for FMCG.

The improvement in dividend pay-out drives up return on equity to seven-year high of 25 percent, CNBC-TV18 reported.

At 15:18 hrs ITC was quoting at Rs 275.20, up Rs 8.70, or 3.26 percent on the BSE.

The market was caught in a bear trap on May 6 with the benchmark indices falling 1.6 percent. Selling was seen across sectors, with financial services, technology, metal, banks and auto being prominent losers.

The fear of faster policy tightening by US Federal Reserve and recession and inflation concerns raised by the Bank of England weighed on the sentiment. The Sensex fell nearly 900 points to 54,836, and the Nifty plunged 271 points to 16,411. The correction in the broader space was higher than that for benchmarks.

The Nifty midcap 100 index was down 1.8 percent and the smallcap 100 index declined 2.5 percent.

Stocks that were in action included Hero MotoCorp, Abbott India and Power Grid Corporation, which bucked the trend and were among the top five gainers in the futures & options segment. ITC was the fourth biggest gainer in the Nifty50.

Hero MotoCorp rallied 2.5 percent to Rs 2,563.35, Abbott India rose 2.2 percent to Rs 16,984, and Power Grid Corporation of India gained 2 percent at Rs 238.40. ITC climbed 1.8 percent to Rs 266.65.

Here's what Rajesh Palviya of Axis Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

Hero MotoCorp

On the daily chart, the stock has rebounded sharply from Rs 2,146 and confirmed “double bottom” trend reversal pattern. In addition, the stock has confirmed higher top and higher bottom formation, which reconfirms bullish sentiments.

The buying momentum was observed from 20-day simple moving average (SMA) at Rs 2,306 and rebounded sharply. The daily “band Bollinger” buy signal reconfirmed positive bias.

The daily and weekly strength indicator relative strength index (RSI) is in a bullish mode along with positive crossover, which supports rising strength in the near term.

Investors should buy, hold and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 2,800-2,850, with downside support at Rs 2,400-2,350.

Abbott India

The stock is in a down trend on the medium-term time frame but on the short-term chart, we observed strong accumulation within Rs 18,500-15,500, representing a sideways trend. Breakout on either side of the range will confirm further direction.

The upper range also coincides with the 200-day SMA (Rs 18,572), hence any decisive breakout above the same may lead to upside momentum.

The stock is sustaining below its 20, 50 100 and 200- day SMAs, which support bearish sentiment. The daily weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI is bearish, signalling the absence of strength.

Investors should wait and watch for trend reversal above Rs 18,500-18,600, and for existing long positions, Rs 16,000-15,500 level will remain critical support.

ITC

The stock is in a strong up trend across all the time frames as it sustains in higher tops and bottoms formation. It has also been well placed above 20, 50 , 100 and 200 days SMA which reconfirm bullish sentiments.

On the weekly time frame, the stock is scaling upwards within the ""up-sloping channel"" indicating an up trend. The daily, weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI is in a bullish mode, which signals sustained strength.

Investors should buy, hold and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 285-300, with downside support at Rs 250-245 levels.

Power Grid Corporation of India

The stock is in a strong up trend across all time frames, as it continues to form a series of higher tops and bottoms. The stock is approaching an all-time high breakout level of Rs 241.

Recently, the stock recaptured its 20-day SMA and rebounded sharply.

The weekly Band-Bollinger Buy signal indicates increased momentum. The daily, weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI is in a bullish mode along with positive crossover, which supports strength in the near term.

Investors should buy, hold and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 250-275, with a downside support zone of Rs 230-220.

Diversified entity ITC on Thursday said it will acquire 10.07 per cent stake in Blupin Technologies Pvt Ltd, the company behind direct-to-consumer(D2C) brand, Mylo for up to Rs 39.34 crore.

The investment will provide the company an early mover advantage in the evolving content-to-community-to-commerce space and will provide an expanded presence in the D2C space, ITC said in a regulatory filing.

Blupin Technologies is a web and app-based content-to-community-to-commerce platform and offers mother and baby care products and services under the brand name 'Mylo'. It is focused on the parenting journey of young families, it added. The cost of acquisition will not exceed Rs 39.34 crore, the filing said.

""With this investment, ITC will further expand its presence in the D2C mother and baby care segment,"" the company said.

""The investment will provide ITC the opportunity to foray into this emerging space and become an integral part of the evolution of this area,"" he added. He further said, the investment in Mylo will also enable ITC to strengthen focus in the mother and baby community building platform, besides expanding its presence in the D2C mother and child care segment.

Earlier in March, speculation was rife about the top fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) acquiring one of the oldest players in the spices segment, Mahashian Di Hatti Pvt. Ltd or MDH. MDH and HUL both denied the move but investors enthused with the reports of the deal, which would have given the largest FMCG company a foothold in the rapidly growing spices segment, where only regional companies have successfully built a play so far.

The spices market in India, according to a report by Avendus Capital, is valued at Rs 70,000 crore, in which branded spices command only a 35 percent share. A paper released by the investment bank last year estimated that the branded spices market is set to double in size by 2025 to Rs 50,000 crore. Avendus estimates that by FY30, 15 spice companies are estimated to exceed Rs 1,000 crore in revenue, and of this, four will achieve ₹5,000 crore in annual turnover.

FMCG companies have so far mostly stayed away from the segment due to its commoditised nature, but the rapid shift of consumers to branded products makes the segment ripe for the picking.

“Till 2000, under the government policy only MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) could sell spices, which limited the entry of large players in the segment. Also, consumers preferred buying spices as commodities and grinding them at home. But that’s changing now and this has triggered the interest of large FMCG companies,” said Ankur Bisen, senior partner and head of the consumer, food and retail practice at consulting firm Technopak.

FMCG in the spices space

Though FMCG companies such as Tata Consumer Products and ITC are trying to gain share in this sector through their brands Tata Sampann and Aashirvaad, respectively, regional players continue to rule the segment.

According to market estimates, Everest, MDH, Sakthi Masala, Aachi and Eastern Condiments are the top players in the packaged spices market. Everest has an 11-12 percent share of the market, MDH 8-9 percent, Sakhti Masala 7 percent, and Aachi and Eastern command 5 percent each, as per industry estimates. About 2,000 brands are competing for a share in the rest of the market (over 50 percent), which makes it a tough segment to crack for FMCG brands. Companies such as ITC and Tata Consumer have managed to gain less than 1 percent share in this market organically so far.

The spices segment can be divided into the subcategories of pure packaged spices and blended spices. Both have their own set of challenges.

Pure spices or commodities are prone to price fluctuations which also impact margins. “The price of the commodities fluctuates frequently and it has to be sourced from mandis, which created bottlenecks for FMCG companies that need supplies in large quantities,” said Sanjesh Thakur, partner, Deloitte India.

The blended spices category, on the other hand, though a high-margin and high-growth category, has its constraints given the varied consumer palate of the country.

“The biggest challenge before any company trying to penetrate this segment is the fact that each region has its spice blend. The way fish curry is cooked in Goa is very different from Maharashtra or West Bengal. Hence, a national-level brand is yet to emerge in this category,” said Thakur.

Pure packaged spices command a margin of 30-35 percent, while companies draw margins of as high as 60 percent from blended spices. The packaged spices market has witnessed a growth rate of 12-15 percent in the last five years, according to industry estimates. The blended spices sub-segment on the other hand has grown at 24-25 percent over the same period.

Consumer goods companies, too, have realised these challenges in the pure and blended spices segment and have taken the inorganic route to tap this segment. ITC in 2020 acquired packaged spices company Sunrise for Rs 2,150 crore. The company is a significant player in the eastern region, with a 15-20 percent share. In West Bengal, Sunrise has a 50 percent share, as per market estimates. Its share nationally, however, is below 5 percent. In another major deal in the segment, Norway’s Orkla Foods acquired Eastern Condiments in 2020 and merged it with MTR Foods, the Bengaluru-based food products company it had bought in 2007.

Finding the right blend

Besides the inorganic route, Tata Consumer and ITC are striving to build a play in the segment organically too. The companies have taken several initiatives such as offering innovative packaging and offering unique blends to edge out regional players.

Tata Consumer and MTR have introduced ziplock packaging for spices to retain their freshness after opening the pack. MTR has introduced “innovative blends” in a bid to outdo regional players. The company has launched spice blends such as Bisibelebath Powder, Vangibath Powder, Tomato Rice Powder, etc.

Tata Consumer is also betting on the consumer shift from the unbranded to branded segment to drive its growth in the category. “There is huge headroom for large players to drive conversion. We are seeing great traction for our pure range of spices as the Tata brand name denotes trust and quality and consumers value this increasingly in a category prone to adulteration,” said Deepika Bhan, president, packaged foods (India), Tata Consumer Products.

ITC is strengthening its distribution in the category and modifying its offerings according to the palate of various regions. “We have customised our products in line with the regional tastes and preferences and have adjusted the delivery on the key parameters in terms of pungency, volatile oil, aroma and the core ingredients itself,” said Ganesh K Sundararaman, SBU chief executive, staples, snacks and meals, foods division, ITC.

“Going forward, the idea is to take the regional specialities to newer markets. We are also looking at introducing new culinary solutions in western cuisine,” he added.

Industry analysts say catering to regional tastes is going to be the top challenge before FMCG companies and, hence, the segment is likely to see further consolidation.

“Spices have always been a regional growth story. All regional players have their flavours and are hence attractive acquisition targets for large FMCG companies,” said Thakur of Deloitte.

“Companies are not likely to start from scratch but acquire these small firms,” he added."

“Facing dual headwinds of weak demand and raw material inflation, consumer staples would see weak earnings print in the fourth quarter, characterised by muted volume growth and year-on-year (y-o-y) margin compression,” said a report by Jeffries.

Companies operating in the discretionary products segment, however, are expected to report a better performance in the fourth quarter. Discretionary products have witnessed a surge in sales with the return of normalcy and easing of Covid-related curbs.

“Even as we note growth moderation in certain discretionary categories, we expect discretionary pack to outperform staples on underlying three-year revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate)—we estimate staples/discretionary (ex-ITC) pack to register 7-14 percent three-year revenue CAGR,” said a note by Kotak Institutional Securities.

The brokerage expects jewellery retailers to report strong revenue helped by market share gains, while it expects further demand recovery for alcoholic beverage companies.

Paints companies, too, indicated brokerages, are expected to report revenue growth as a result of price hikes. Margins, however, will continue to be stressed given the high inflation in crude oil derivatives.

Battered by inflation for several quarters now, FMCG companies were hopeful that a declining trend would start with the closing of FY22 and that pressure would finally ease off in the second half. However, the Russia-Ukraine war, which has triggered a price rise in several key commodities, has dashed these hopes.

Companies such as Marico and Godrej Consumer Products reported a decline in FMCG volumes due to the weak demand scenario.

“During the quarter, consumption trends remained subdued amidst weak rural sentiment and inflation in global commodities aggravating due to geopolitical tensions. While companies effected price hikes across FMCG categories to cope with the cost push, persistent inflation continued to hurt consumer wallets across rural and urban. As a result, FMCG volumes declined in the January-February 2022 period on a year-on-year basis as per Nielsen,” said Marico in its quarterly update.

The company reported low single-digit revenue growth in the quarter, while volumes were marginally positive on an exceptionally high base (25 percent), leading to a double-digit volume growth on a two-year CAGR basis.

Godrej Consumer said it expects to deliver a higher than mid-single-digit sales growth and a two-year CAGR around mid-teens.

“On the profitability front, we expect lower year-on-year EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins during the quarter. This is due to input inflation and our weak performance in Indonesia,” it added.

The third quarter of the fiscal 2022 had also seen a decline in volumes for several FMCG companies. Companies such as Hindustan Unilever, Godrej Consumer Products, Emami and Marico registered low to flat volume growth as demand for their products declined. HUL reported volume growth of 2 percent in the quarter ended December compared with 4 percent growth in the second quarter.

According to Jefferies, HUL is likely to see 1 percent volume decline, 8 percent revenue growth and a y-o-y margin contraction.

“ITC cigarette Ebit should grow 10 percent, with volume up 9 percent. Britannia, Colgate, Marico and Emami would likely see muted 0-3 percent volume growth, with y-o-y margin decline and weak Ebitda growth,” it said.

Dabur, said the brokerage, is likely to see pressure in health and personal care and healthcare, partly offset by foods. “Margin pressure could dent Nestle's Ebitda, despite good volume growth,” it added."

The benchmark indices managed to close with moderate gains amid volatility in the week ended April 8, especially after the Friday's RBI move that was on expected lines, but there was a big underperformance, compared to broader markets. The Nifty Midcap index gained 3.6 percent and the Smallcap index rose 2.7 percent during the week, while the Nifty50 gained 0.6 percent to close at 17,784.

The good part was that the Nifty50 managed to hold on to the 17,600 mark, which experts feel can act as an immediate crucial support, with resistance remaining at 18,100, the recent highs touched by the market. Breaking on either side could give firm direction to the market in coming days, experts said. The index also strongly held above 50 DMA (17,140), 100 DMA (17,307) and 200 DMA (17,131).

""In the coming week, 17,600 followed by 17,400 are likely to provide some cushion for the index and till the time, we do not close below these key levels, we would continue with our 'buy on decline' strategy,"" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.

On the flipside, he said, the first sign of strength would be visible after surpassing the 17,900 mark.

This week is likely to be truncated and hence, do not expect any big-bang move in key indices, he feels. ""The upside as of now looks limited for the week towards 18,000–18,100. But the way broader market kept buzzing in the challenging phase last week as well, one must continue to focus outside the index.""

The market will remain shut on April 14 for Mahavir Jayanti and Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Jayanti, and April 15 for Good Friday.

Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on April 8 closing prices:

Expert: Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities

Equitas Holdings: Buy | LTP: Rs 119.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 111 | Target: Rs 132 | Return: 10.5 percent

After showing rangebound action in the last one month, the stock price has moved up sharply in last week. Currently, the stock price has made an attempt of upside breakout of down sloping trend line around Rs 119-120 levels. Hence, a sustainable move above this area could open sharp upside ahead.

The larger degree of higher tops and bottoms is intact as per weekly timeframe chart and the stock price has formed a recent higher bottom at Rs 100 levels. Volume and weekly 14 period RSI (relative strength index) indicates further strengthening of upside momentum for the stock price ahead.

Buying can be initiated in Equitas at current market price), add more on dips down to Rs 114, and wait for the upside target of Rs 132 in the next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss of Rs 111.

National Fertilizers: Buy | LTP: Rs 60.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 56 | Target: Rs 67.50 | Return: 11.4 percent

The below weekly timeframe chart of National Fertilizers indicates an excellent up-move over the last few weeks. The stock price has witnessed an upside breakout of the crucial resistance of down sloping trend line at Rs 59 and moved up in last week.

The present stock movement could be considered as a crucial upside breakout of an uptrend and a sharp up-move is likely to continue for the near term.

Volume has started to expand during upside breakout in the stock price and weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication. Hence, one may expect further strengthening of upside momentum in the stock price ahead.

One may look to buy NFL at current market price, add more on dips down to Rs 58 and wait for the upside target of Rs 67.50 in the next 3-4 weeks, while placing stop-loss at Rs 56.

Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 106.50 | Stop-Loss: Rs 99.50 | Target: Rs 118 | Return: 10.8 percent

The below weekly timeframe chart of Bombay Dyeing indicates rangebound action over the last 5-6 weeks after a sharp decline of February month. The stock price is currently making an attempt to stage upside breakout of the range movement at Rs 106-107 levels. Hence a sustainable move above this area could open a sharp up-move for the stock price ahead.

The larger degree of positive sequence like higher tops and bottoms is intact and the stock price is now moving up after the formation of new higher bottom. Volume pattern and weekly 14 period RSI shows positive indication for the stock price ahead.

One may look to buy Bombay Dyeing at current market price, add more on dips down to Rs 102.50 and wait for the upside target of Rs 118 in the next 3-4 weeks, while placing a stop-loss of Rs 99.50.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 741.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 680 | Target: Rs 850-900 | Return: 14.6-21.3 percent

The stock is forming a series of higher tops and higher bottoms, which is extremely positive. The stock has again surpassed its previous highs last week with the decisive dismissal. Such a pattern helps the stock to move into a new bullish segment.

The Rs 680 level will be a great support for the stock and as long as the stock is trading above it, the chances of reaching Rs 850 or Rs 900 will be bright.

The strategy should be to buy at Rs 750 and add more at Rs 710. Place the last stop-loss at Rs 680.

UPL: Buy | LTP: Rs 809.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 780 | Target: Rs 865-900 | Return: 7-11 percent

The stock is forming a V shaped recovery pattern, which indicates a sudden development in the stock, which may lift the stock above its previous highs. This is in contrast to the construction of a circular plane.

The rounding bottom formation enables the stock to make a gradual upward move, while the V-shaped recovery helps the stock to make a rapid upward move.

The stock is a buy at current levels with a stop-loss at Rs 780. At higher levels, resistance would be at Rs 865 and Rs 950 in the coming weeks.

Expert: Pushkaraj Sham Kanitkar, VP Equities at GEPL Capital

ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 267.8 | Stop-Loss: Rs 242 | Target: Rs 325 | Return: 21 percent

ITC last week traded at a 52-week high. In the process it has broken out of six-month consolidation pattern spanning around a quadrilateral pattern. The daily chart shows that the prices have a tendency to move up in staggered manner since the panic lows of March 2020.

The first leg of consolidation saw it traded between Rs 160 and Rs 210 during August to December 2020. The next leg saw it consolidated between Rs 200-225. The current leg has traversed between Rs 210 and Rs 260.

The long-term moving averages are positively aligned with 50 DMA (daily moving average Rs 234.50) trading above the 100 as well as the 200 DMA (Rs 224), while the 100 DMA (Rs 228.5) is also in turn trading above the 200 DMA (224).

On the weekly charts, one can see a space in chart for up-move till Rs 325 (2018's high). The extrapolated price patterns target to indicate an up-move till around Rs 315-320 (Height of the quadrilateral).

The above view will get negated only if the momentum is lost and prices trade below the median at Rs 242 on a closing basis.

Bharti Airtel: Buy | LTP: Rs 762 | Stop-Loss: Rs 742 | Target: Rs 900 | Return: 18 percent

Bharti Airtel last week traded at a 52-week as well as an all-time high. In the process it has broken out of 6-month long consolidation pattern spanning around a W-shaped pattern. The daily chart shows that the prices have earlier too shown a tendency to move up in staggered manner. The W pattern may also be envisaged as a part of 'flag and pole', which can culminate successfully if prices cross above Rs 785.

The long-term moving averages are positively aligned with 50 DMA (Rs 714.85) trading above the 100 as well as the 200 DMA, while the 100 DMA (Rs 710.90) is also in turn trading above the 200 DMA (Rs 673.13). The latest cross over is part of parallel move of the 50-100 DMA encompassing over last 3 months, including the zigzags intermittently.

The extrapolated levels in contention would be Rs 900 mark, approximately the depth of W pattern after a breakout above the level of Rs 785. The above view will get negated only if the momentum is lost and prices trade below the median at Rs 742 on a closing basis.

Voltas: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,317.6 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,220 | Target: Rs 1,581 | Return: 20 percent

Voltas last week traded at a 52-week as well as an all-time high. In the process it is close to breaking out of 6-month long consolidation pattern spanning around a 'Rectangle' pattern.

Similar pattern spanned between February & September 2021, which was then followed by up-move till Rs 1,351 in October 2021.

The long-term moving averages are positively aligned with 50 DMA (Rs 1,231) trading above the 100 as well as the 200 DMA, while the 100 DMA (Rs 1,227) is also in turn trading above the 200 DMA (Rs 1,175). The latest cross over is part of parallel move of the 50-100 DMA encompassing over last 3 months, including the zig zags intermittently.

The extrapolated levels in contention would be Rs 1,581 mark, approximately the depth of rectangle pattern after a breakout above the level of Rs 1,351.

The above view will get negated only if the momentum is lost and prices trade below the convergence of 50-100 DMA at Rs 1,220.

Expert: Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities

Bharat Electronics: Buy | LTP: Rs 240 | Stop-Loss: Rs 207 | Target: Rs 260-280 | Return: 8.5-17 percent

On weekly charts, price action shows that after consolidating for 5-6 months, the stock has given strong breakout which signals further upside in stock.

Also MACD (moving average convergence divergence) crossed above its signal line which qualifies bullish trend in stock. Hence we recommend buy with stop-loss of Rs 207 and possible price targets of Rs 260-280.

Havells India: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,268 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,170 | Target: Rs 1,425 | Return: 12.4 percent

On weekly charts, the stock has closed above its all-important moving averages. Also, on volume front, the stock has seen one of highest volumes since December 2021.

Last Friday, the stock has been successfully closed above its major resistance zone of Rs 1,200-1,250 which indicates strength in stock.

Hence we recommend buy with stop-loss of Rs 1,170 and possible price target of Rs 1,425.

As customers have started making their summer vacation plans, hotels and resorts across India are seeing an uptick in advance bookings, with many popular tourist spots reporting 60 percent of the available rooms in hotels having been booked.

Hotels and resorts in popular tourist hotspots like Delhi, Mumbai, Panaji, Kochi, Srinagar, Shimla, Nainital, and Dehradun have even seen advance booking rates climb to above pre-pandemic levels.

“What we are experiencing in the last four to six weeks is a strong revival. I can definitely speak for IHCL that our March, April, and May (2022) business on the books is higher than in March, April, and May of 2019,” Managing Director & CEO of Indian Hotels Puneet Chhatwal, said.

Similarly, Vikramjit Singh, President, Lemon Tree Hotels, said with the way advance bookings are pouring in for April and May he expects bookings to rise beyond pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of 2022-23.

Vibhas Prasad, Director of Leisure Hotels Group, added that their hotels and resorts are seeing robust demand across all destinations.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Online travel agencies (OTAs) have also seen a rise in bookings and searches for hotels across India. Data from Yatra.com show that bookings for hotels in Goa, Kerala, Puducherry, Rishikesh, Shimla, Nainital, and Dehradun have risen nearly 100 percent compared to March.

Furthermore, search queries for hotels have risen by nearly 250 percent in the first week of April compared to March.

“Leisure travel demand continues to lead recovery, and we are hoping for a promising travel season as summer begins. Goa, Srinagar, Rishikesh, and Mussoorie are some of the destinations that people are currently searching and booking hotel reservations in,” a spokesperson for MakeMyTrip said.

Price hikes

Encouraged by the rising demand, hotel chains have also increased prices across popular destinations. Data collected from OTAs show that the average room rates for metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata, have risen by up to 40 percent.

“Most major hotel chains in India had hiked prices of their rooms by around 5-10 percent on year in February. These rates have risen around 30 percent for April and May,” an official from Yatra.com said.

He added that some popular tourist destinations like Shimla, Goa, and Nainital are even seeing price hikes of 100-150 percent year-on-year.

Pradeep Shetty, Joint Secretary, Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India, said that currently, hotels at tourist destinations are seeing a spike in bookings, resulting in a rise in average room rates across the country.

“Rates in top business hotels in Mumbai have gone up by close to 50 percent over the past two weeks. Hotel rates in leisure locations are about 2x or 3x of 2019 rates,” an official from ITC said.

The rise in hotel bookings is also due to customers willing to spend more on travel, officials said.

Furthermore, the wedding season in parts of North India, which was interrupted in January and February due to the outbreak of the third wave of COVID-19, is back on the rise.

“There is a lot of bounce-back on weddings; April, May, June, July have a number of auspicious dates,” Ajay Bakaya, Managing Director of Sarovar Hotels, said.

International tourists

While there is a surge in bookings from domestic travelers across India for the upcoming summer, the inflow of international tourists has still been slow.

“A rise in cases in China, coupled with geopolitical tensions across Europe has led to a slower inflow of international tourists than was expected when international flights open up,” a senior official from a large hotel chain said.

He added that the industry was expecting at least a 50 percent rise in international bookings for the upcoming summer period once international flights restart, but till now the rise in international bookings has been slow.

Similarly, data from OTAs show that while queries from international tourists for popular tourist destinations have been on the rise, a large number of these queries have not translated into bookings.

“Travel queries have risen by nearly 70 percent from international tourists, but bookings have risen only 15 percent in the first week of April compared to March,” the official from Yatra.com said.

Hotel chains across India are also seeing international tourists accounting for only 5-10 percent of their advance bookings."

Shares of ITC have outperformed those of Hindustan Unilever so far this year amid margin pressure for the fast-moving consumer goods company due to hardening crude oil prices.

ITC has surged over 20 percent year to date, while Hindustan Unilever shares have dropped 8 percent. The benchmark Sensex and Nifty 50 have gained 1.5 percent each, while the BSE FMCG index rose 1 percent.

The subdued performance of Hindustan Unilever shares can be largely attributed to a slowdown in the rural market, resulting in a moderation of sales volumes since the third quarter of FY22 and higher input costs affecting profitability over the past two quarters, analysts said.

According to brokerage Sharekhan, domestic consumers are switching to low-price units and cutting discretionary spending due to a sustained slowdown in the rural markets and a high inflationary environment. It expects Hindustan Unilever’s sales volumes to decline in the fourth quarter from a year ago. However, India’s largest consumer goods company increased prices across its product portfolio and that may result in low-to-mid-single digit revenue growth during the quarter.

Hindustan Unilever executives had indicated earlier that higher costs of inputs such as crude oil and palm oil would increase pressure on gross margins in the fourth quarter. Price increases of 2-13 percent across the product portfolio, along with an 8 percent increase in Q3, would help in mitigating a rise in input costs in Q4.

War impact

However, a sharp increase in commodity prices following the Russia-Ukraine war and supply disruption would lead to operating profit margins declining in the first quarter of FY23, Sharekhan said. It expects a sharp decline in margins in the first half of FY23, which might improve only in the second half if commodity prices ease.

Nielsen data suggests a high-single digit volume decline and flattish value for Hindustan Unilever in both urban and rural India, with the rural market more impacted. Among all product categories, beauty (skin and hair care) would be impacted more, while laundry and nutrition sales would also be affected.

Prices of palm oil and its derivatives, which are used in Hindustan Unilever’s skin cleansing and hair care categories, have been climbing. So have prices of crude oil and its derivatives, which are key inputs for its laundry and household care products.

Inflation hedge

ITC is the least affected by the rural slowdown because its portfolio comprises mainly foods, analysts said. The company offers the best inflation hedge as its core business is completely immune to inflation risk. With volume growth back in the cigarette market and tailwinds elsewhere, ITC may offer earnings surprises in FY23, the analysts added.

ITC is one of the largest consumer companies in India, with businesses spanning categories such as cigarettes, hotels, paper and agri-commodities. Its branded foods division, with products such as staples, confectionery, noodles, snacks and biscuits, is performing well and gaining strong market share across many categories.

“We expect the volume in cigarettes to revive at a CAGR of 5% during FY22–24E as against a CAGR of -1% during FY11–21; FMCG’s EBITDA margin to scale up to higher single digits; and the hotel, paperboard and agri-commodities businesses to revive. This will lead to an earnings CAGR of 12% in FY22–24E against a mere 7% in the last five years,” Edelweiss Wealth Research said in a note.

The brokerage has set a target price of Rs 450 for ITC shares, which is up 80 percent from the current market price."

""We believe ITC can be picked up by long-term investors despite the fact that it has run up quite a bit,"" says Mohit Nigam, Head of PMS at Hem Securities. ITC shares gained 17 percent in March, the most in sixteen months.

The company is relatively insulated as it has other verticals such as hotels and cigarettes, which cushion the blow to its FMCG segment from the sharp rise in input costs, he says.

In case of Reliance Industries, which hit Rs 18 lakh crore in market capitalisation, he says historically, the stock has managed to deliver returns at the CAGR of 30 percent since FY18 and is expected to continue the similar upward journey in FY23 too.

FY22 ended on a strong note with around 20 percent gains. Do you think considering the current headwinds including commodity inflation and earnings worries, the market can deliver similar kind of returns in FY23?

Markets are bound to rise, the previous peaks will be surpassed by higher highs. Commodity inflation, geopolitical crisis, earnings headwinds are all temporary, one should look at the broader picture. The ongoing reforms in the nation, imposition of technology, promotion of Made in India PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme, increase in exports, China plus 1 strategy and other incentives are some of the key factors that will drive the markets ahead.

Being a democratic nation, India is already in a sweet spot amidst the ongoing war situation. However, the degree and time in which these reforms and policies will be successful will decide the time for the market to bounce again. All in all India is working towards improving the environment for investors which will be a key driver for its growth strategy.

Monetary Policy Committee will hold its first policy meet for FY23. Do you think the Reserve Bank of India and governor commentary will give a hint about rate hikes given the expected inflation concerns or will the RBI prefer to stay behind the curve and focus on growth? Do you expect any rate hikes in FY23?

In this time of conflict, the central bank's monetary policy meeting in April will encounter a number of obstacles, including rising prices and the likelihood of a GDP slowdown. We expected a rate hike at the policy meeting, but now expect it to be postponed due to growing geopolitical worries over Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its impact on commodity prices.

The RBI has remained at a stalemate on interest rates for a long time, and at its most recent policy meeting, it decided against a widely expected rate hike to spur growth. Governor Shaktikanta Das is in charge of keeping inflation under control but also protecting the country's still-fragile economy. As a result, rate rises by the RBI are more likely to be delayed until later this year.

ITC has run up a lot in the last one month. What are the major reasons behind the same and what is your call on the stock? Is it looking expensive now?

Shares of ITC surged nearly 17 percent in March, the most in sixteen months, even as its peers dropped on fears of margin pressure due to input cost inflation. The scrip has been going up when the entire market was coming down due to various reasons. Firstly, with the rise in tobacco volumes and the excise duty which has been kept unchanged in the Union Budget for FY23 has done well for the steady rise in volumes of both cigarettes and tobacco. Secondly, the hotels business is definitely showing a positive momentum with the lifting of most Covid restrictions post the third-wave that has led to an increase in mobility and therefore augurs well for ITC's hotel business.

Apart from this, it does have a paper business which is likely to do well in the backdrop of tight paper supplies in the domestic market and a possible surge in paper exports. So all this does point well for ITC and we believe it can be picked up by long-term investors despite the fact that it has run up quite a bit. The company is relatively insulated as it has other verticals such as hotels and cigarettes, which cushion the blow to its FMCG segment from the sharp rise in input costs.

If you have Rs 10 lakh and you want to split into asset classes including equity, gold, fixed income etc. How do you go about it, as we just entered into FY23? Also what is your allocation to largecap, midcap and smallcap in the equity space?

We all know that asset allocation is the key in any portfolio. An investor can allocate its portfolio in debt, equity, gold, real estate etc. based on the investor's risk-return profile, horizon and investment objective. Equity leads to growth in your wealth over the long term, and debt lends stability in the portfolio as well as growth in wealth i.e. investors who prefer relatively higher returns are heavy on equity and those who prefer relative stability are more into debt investments.

An investor can allocate its fund in the pattern: 65 percent to equity, 20 percent to debt and 15 percent to gold. FY23 can be a good year for equities and investors can allocate their major chunks in equities and among equities approximately 50 percent should be invested in Large cap, 30 percent should be in Mid Cap and remaining should be in small cap for multibagger returns.

Reliance Industries hit Rs 18 lakh crore of market cap now and gained 30 percent, if I am correct, in FY22. How do you approach the stock and will it give similar kind of returns by end of FY23 too?

Reliance Industries, the largest Indian company by market capitalisation, has given decent correction after hitting Rs 18 lakh crore mark. The stock managed to end the FY22 near life highs after a strong breakout in the month of March. The stock seems to be getting ready for the next rally as fundamentally the company has never been stronger.

After achieving the net debt mark ahead of the targeted timeline, the company is now focusing on reducing the funding cost and has raised the debt just before interest rates started rising globally primarily to refinance high-cost debt. The oil-to-retail conglomerate is expected to have an eventful FY23 with the upcoming 5G auction and is expected to perform well across all the business segments.

Historically, the stock has managed to deliver returns at the CAGR of 30 percent since FY18 and is expected to continue the similar upward journey in FY23 too.

Given the commodities prices are rising, and inflation is a big headwind, what is the impact on overall corporate earnings and also will the impact last for two or more quarters?

Quarter 4 result season is around the corner and, we believe there will be shrinkage in margins due to rising input cost caused by rising geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine. Petrol and diesel prices are continuously hiked thus, increasing logistics cost. Important raw materials like aluminium and copper have risen by 26 percent and 7 percent respectively in the last three months. Whereas, natural gas rose by 47 percent in the last three months. Going forward, we believe there might be some relief in input cost and some improvement in corporate earnings can be witnessed from Q1FY23.

Shares of ITC Ltd surged nearly 17 percent in March, the most in sixteen months, even as its peers dropped on fears of margin pressure due to rising input costs. The stock has been an underperformer for the past few years due to stagnant financials, ESG concerns and exposure to COVID.

Peers such as Godrej Consumer lost 8% in March, Nestle India dropped 3%, Hindustan Unilever declined 8%, Dabur India 7.6% while Marico fell 5.4%. Godrej Consumer, Nestle India and Hindustan Unilever have dropped for the third consecutive month while Dabur India declined for the fourth month. Marico fell for the fifth month.

Many FMCG stocks are under pressure due to an increase in input prices amid rising crude and global commodity rates and global supply chain disruption during COVID as well as the Russia-Ukraine war. The firms are also facing lower demand due to increased prices, said Vinit Bolinjkar, head of research, Ventura Securities.

However, analysts expect ITC to be least affected by the rural slowdown as its portfolio comprises mainly foods. The company offers the best inflation hedge as its core business is completely immune to inflation risk. With volume growth back in the cigarette market and tailwinds elsewhere, ITC may offer earnings surprises in FY23, analysts added.

ITC is one of the largest consumer companies in India, with businesses spanning categories such as cigarettes, hotels, paper and agri-commodities. Its branded foods division, with products such as staples, confectionery, noodles, snacks and biscuits, is performing well and gaining strong market share across many categories.

In the cigarette business, analysts say legal cigarette players gained market share from illegal players (almost one-fourth of the market), as no tax hike was announced for the second consecutive year.

ITC's agri commodity businesses are likely to benefit from wheat exports because of the Ukraine crisis. Analysts say Russia and Ukraine account for 30% of global exports if the Indian wheat crop is good, regulators have a conducive policy and India’s food inflation does not become a big challenge.

The firm's hotel sector is likely to see strong recovery in fiscal year 2023 after continued falling COVID cases and recently India started international flights. According to Omkar Mistry, analyst with Choice Broking, faster recovery in hotel business is expected given the vaccination drives and improving economic indicators.

ITC's paper business is likely to benefit after re-opening of offices, educational institutions and courts; this has led to regularisation of demand, sales volume coupled with higher realisation. This was despite a sharp increase in major input costs in the recent period, analysts added.

Although gross margins in ITC's FMCG sector are likely to remain under pressure, cost optimisation and price hikes will help. Considering these factors and a dividend yield of 4-5%, brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities has maintained a buy rating on the stock.

Of the 36 brokers tracking the ITC stock on Bloomberg, 27 have recommended a buy rating, seven have a hold on the stock and one has a sell rating.

""We expect the volume in cigarettes to revive at a CAGR of 5% during FY22–24E as against a CAGR of -1% during FY11–21; FMCG’s EBITDA margin to scale up to higher single digits; and the hotel, paperboard and agri-commodities businesses to revive. This will lead to an earnings CAGR of 12% in FY22–24E against a mere 7% in the last five years,"" said Edelweiss Wealth Research in a note. The brokerage firm has given a target price of Rs 450 a share, up 80% from the current market price."

A few years ago a charcoal soap or an onion hair oil would typically be a product found on a new-age direct-to-consumer (D2C) company’s website. Now, these innovations can be found on the shelves of supermarkets and even daily kirana stores.

Thanks to digital and social media, FMCG companies have an ear to the ground and are constantly launching new products developed using insights and customer feedback from these platforms.

Take for instance, ITC, which launched frozen snacks and cooking pastes under the ITC Master Chef brand during the pandemic after identifying a consumer trend towards convenience foods. Godrej Consumer Products, similarly, introduced a charcoal soap under the Cinthol brand as it found customers searching for the product on its direct-to-consumer platform.

“Digital media and social media are powerful tools that help understand what consumers want, work on new products and develop them,” Somasree Bose Awasthi, Chief Marketing Officer (India), Godrej Consumer Products, told Moneycontrol.

A sound new product development (NPD) strategy, experts point out, is essential for the long-term growth of an FMCG company, especially in a market like India, where consumers are constantly looking for innovation.

“NPD traction is more than just a ‘few percentage points of extra growth (for a year)’. While the general perception is that the benefit of increased NPD traction is limited to a few percentage points of extra growth (for a year or so), we believe it is much more than that,” said a recent report by ICICI Securities.

“We believe the success of NPD is essential to provide longevity to an organization,” it added.

Social Listening

Several FMCG companies have roped in digital marketing companies for ‘social listening’, a way to draw insights from social networking platforms, while others have set up in-house teams for the purpose.

“ITC has set up a marketing command centre called Sixth Sense which delivers on multiple pillars encompassing insights, data, moment marketing, tracking social media metrics and even industry benchmarking,” said Shuvadip Banerjee, Chief Digital Marketing Officer, ITC Limited.

According to Banerjee, Sixth Sense helps the company understand conversations on social media platforms, which leads to the identification of key trends and, in turn, product development and packaging ideas.

“The traditional way to get feedback from customers is through customer trials and market research, which would take three-four months. But now, through digital and social media, consumer goods companies can get a more data points to build feedback into product design and in a more cost-effective way,” said Dipankar Maganty, Principal, Kearney.

Tata Consumer Products, too, has launched a slew of products after popular demand on social media. The company marked its entry into the premium coffee space last year by launching D2C brand Sonnets. While the range initially offered only French Press and coffee filter grinds, six months after the launch the company also introduced Moka Pot, given the consumer demand on social media.

“Over the last few months, several customers reached out to us via direct messages and comments, enquiring about whole bean coffee. Based on this feedback, we recently launched the whole beans range of Sonnets,” said Puneet Das, President – Packaged Beverages (India & South Asia), Tata Consumer Products.

The company also plans to soon launch a range of teas under the 1868 by Tata Tea brand, based on consumer feedback on social media.

“We also actively take polls on social media to understand consumer preferences. Polls are a quick and easy way to gauge consumer interest or get feedback in real-time. Actively listening to consumer conversations on social media has helped us keep our product assortment exciting and desirable,” said Das.

Taking on D2C

The emergence of digital-native brands, which are agile in launching products, has also made it imperative for FMCG companies to keep up with trends and launch innovative products.

Companies such as Marico, Emami and Bajaj Consumer Care have launched products such as onion hair oil and onion shampoos as they try to compete with D2C brands.

Players such as Dabur, Marico, Emami and Tata Consumer Products are launching products exclusively for their D2C platforms and marketplaces as they compete with digital-first brands. Dabur India, for instance, aims to clock Rs 100 crore in sales from its digital-native brands in FY23. Dabur plans to launch superfoods such as chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, and other healthy snacks under its Real Health brands on the e-commerce channel.

“If you look at our overall NPD-to-sales ratio in the quarter (Q3), it stood at 3.6 percent. However, in the e-commerce space it is around 10 percent. Hence, we are poised to exit at a rate of around Rs 100 crore from NPD in the e-commerce or digital space. We will end this year at around Rs 60-70 crore but next year we should be crossing around Rs 100 crore on the NPD of the digitally native brands,” Mohit Malhotra, CEO, Dabur, had said while addressing an investor call in February.

NPD-to-sales ratio determines what percentage of a company’s sales are being drawn from its new product launches.

However, this has also emerged as a way for companies to test-market their products on the masses via online channels. “Online offers you the opportunity to test market some of these niche products in a cost-efficient way,” said Dipankar Maganty of Kearney,” said Maganty of Kearney."

Bears retained their dominance on Dalal Street for the fourth consecutive week ended March 4. The intensifying war between Ukraine and Russia, and climbing oil prices to a decade high spooked markets during the week. Weak third-quarter GDP numbers and February auto sales data also weighed on the sentiment.

The Nifty50 fell 2.5 percent or 413 points to 16,245 during the week, the lowest closing level since August 6. The index has formed a bearish candle on the weekly scale and, considering the current war situation, the index falling below 16,000 amid current elevated volatility can be possible in the short term before getting bottomed out, but in case that happens then that would be great buying opportunity, experts feel.

""Although such war scenarios are always tricky, we can clearly see a negative trend on the weekly time-frame charts,"" said Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One.

In addition, the falling slope of RSI-smoothened oscillator is an indication of further weakness. So, though the Nifty has reached the initial target of 16,200, we do not want to pre-empt a near-term bottom here, he says, adding 16,000–15,900 is to be seen as an immediate support, while on the higher side, 16,450, followed by 16,600, will be strong resistances.

""Looking at the war situation, we will not be surprised to see the Nifty enter sub-16,000 terrain, but we do not expect the index to slip below 15,500–15,200, as of now,"" Chavan said.

From an investor's point of view, he feels this is certainly an excellent opportunity to bag quality stocks in a staggered manner but for traders, it will be difficult to say that worse is behind.

Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next 3-4 weeks. Returns are based on March 4 closing prices.

Expert: Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak Securities

Hindalco Industries: Buy | LTP: 583.80 | Stop-Loss: Rs 550 | Target: Rs 660 | Return: 13 percent

The stock had spent a lot of time below the Rs 550 level. On the decisive break of Rs 550, the stock is set to move towards Rs 660 in the near future.

On Friday, the stock corrected at Rs 580 after hitting a high of Rs 619. As the trend is strong, we need to buy on each of the major support with a stop-loss at Rs 550.

Jindal Steel and Power: Buy | LTP: 435.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 420 | Target: Rs 470-500 | Return: 15 percent

The stock is forming a double bottom formation. Our view is that the stock is moving towards a low of Rs 470. It is available at Rs 435, which is the major support for the stock and if Rs 475 is decisively crossed then we can also see Rs 500 levels which was its previous level high.

In short, the stock is gaining momentum and the strategy should be to add long positions at each of the major support. To keep the long position safe, we need to place a tight stop-loss at Rs 420.

ACC: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,010.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,050 | Target: Rs 1,900-1,850 | Return: 8 percent

The stock has broken the key Rs 2,000 support, above which it has spent more than 9 months. This is a decisive breakdown.

The stock is trending lower according to the Directional Moving Index Oscillator (DMI), suggesting that we should have a seller at each resistance. The broad formation of the stock is between Rs 2,000 and Rs 1,975. Place a stop-loss at Rs 2,050.

Expert: Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities

Birlasoft: Buy | LTP: Rs 437.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 380 | Target: Rs 485-510 | Return: 16 percent

After making high of Rs 585 on January 10, 2022, the stock has fallen and touched the level of Rs 380 on February 24, 2022. Afterwards, the stock is continuously forming higher highs & higher lows in last few trading sessions & has successfully close above 10 & 20 EMA (exponential moving average).

Also, on daily charts, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) crosses above its signal line which qualifies bullish trend in stock while on weekly charts, a bullish Engulfing pattern is formed. Hence, we believe that stock is poised for upside rally with medium term target of Rs 510.

Tips Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,090.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,800 | Target: Rs 2,450-2,610 | Return: 25 percent

On daily chart, MACD crosses above its signal line which qualifies bullish trend in stock while on weekly chart, stock has formed strong base at around Rs 1,800 level.

Any sustainable close above Rs 2,270 will bring further strength in stock and lead the price movement upwards towards Rs 2,450-2,600 level. Hence, we believe that stock is medium term buy opportunity with possible price targets of Rs 2,450-2,610.

Expert: Vinay Rajani, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at HDFC Securities

Wipro: Buy | LTP: Rs 575.30 | Stop-Loss: Rs 555 | Target: Rs 610 | Return: 6 percent

The stock has surpassed the crucial resistance of its 20-day EMA. There has been series of positive divergences registered on the daily RSI oscillator, which shows the accumulation in the stock.

Other indicators like daily MACD has also been trading above its equilibrium line. IT sector has been showing strength in the current scenario and depreciating rupee against dollar could also help the sector to outperform.

Larsen & Toubro: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,711.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,765 | Target: Rs 1,625 | Return: 5 percent

The stock has been forming lower tops and lower bottoms on the daily charts. Stock has breached crucial support of its 200-day EMA. Indicators and oscillators like RSI, MACD and DMI (directional movement index) have turned bearish on the short term charts.

Indicators and oscillators have been indicating bearish trend for the medium term. Stock price has broken down below 5-day of consolidation along with rising volumes.

Shriram Transport Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,089.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,125 | Target: Rs 1,010 | Return: 7 percent

After a big bearish candle on February 24, 2022, the stock went in to consolidation phase for next four trading sessions.

Considering the primary trend, stock is on the verge of breaking below the recent swing low, which will result in to breakdown from the consolidation. Stock has been trading below is important moving averages.

Expert: Ruchit Jain, Lead Research at 5paisa.com

Bajaj Finance: Sell | LTP: Rs 6,537.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 6,725 | Target: Rs 6,300 | Return: 4 percent

Recently, the stock has consolidated in a range above its '200-DMA. However, towards the end of the week the prices gave a breakdown below the support with a gap down. The 'RSI' oscillator is indicating a weak momentum while the short term moving average is below the medium term indicating a short term downtrend. We expect further correction in the stock in the short term and hence, short term traders should look to sell the stock on any pullback move.

Hence, short term traders can look for shorting opportunities in the range of Rs 6,570-6,590 with a stop-loss placed above Rs 6,725 for potential short term targets of Rs 6,300. (The given levels are of cash segment which can be used as reference to trade in futures segment)

While the stock did not participate in the recent market uptrend, it is now witnessing buying interest in such an uncertain environment due to its low volatility. The prices up move during the week have been supported by rising volumes while the momentum oscillators are indicating positive traction. Prices have given a breakout above its 'Bollinger Bands’ which are rising now and hence, we expect a positive trend in the stock in the near term.

Hence, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy the stock in the range of Rs 225-220 for potential targets of Rs 242 and Rs 250 in the near term. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 210 on long positions.

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

ITC’s Q3FY2022 cigarettes sales volume growth stood at 12-13% (net revenues grew by 12.6%); Cigarette EBIT margin (based on net sales) improved by 117 bps on y-o-y basis. Sales volume stood flat compared to pre-COVID levels. Non-cigarette FMCG business revenues grew 9% in Q3FY2022 on a high base (two-years CAGR stood at 11%). Agri-business revenues doubled to Rs. 4962.4 crore led by higher exports. Cigarette sales volumes are set to improve further as government has not hiked taxes on cigarettes for second consecutive year. Non-cigarette FMCG biz would grow in single digits while paperboard, paper & packaging business would clock strong double-digit growth in the near term.

Outlook

The company declared an interim dividend of Rs. 5.25 per share. Stock is trading at discounted valuations of 16.7x/15.0x its FY2023/24E EPS. We maintain a Buy recommendation on the stock with PT of Rs. 280.

The company reported a net revenue of Rs 6,244 crore for its cigarettes segment in the quarter ended December, a jump of 13.6 percent year-on-year (y-o-y) compared to Rs 5,498 crore reported in the corresponding period last year. Sequentially, too, revenue for the cigarettes segment jumped 11 percent versus Rs 5,642 crore registered in the year-ago period. The segment contributed 35 percent to the company’s overall revenue in the said period.

“ITC reported a strong Q3 led by a beat in four out of five segments. Cigarette volume growth at 12 percent was a surprise, with two-year-CAGR (compound annual growth rate) at over 2 percent—this is the first positive print after seven quarters and should also allay concerns on consumer behavior,” said a note by brokerage firm Jefferies.

The company also posted a 14 percent growth in cigarette EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) to Rs 3,950 crore, its highest ever in a quarter.

“Cigarette volumes were back to pre-Covid levels after nearly two years. Management pointed to a robust recovery seen across markets, aided by increase in mobility and improved market servicing,” the Jeffries report added.

ITC’s management in a statement indicated that the cigarettes category saw robust recovery across markets aided by an increase in mobility and agile supply chain and market servicing. The company also said the introduction of several new products and variants of existing ones during the quarter accelerated the recovery.

“Recent launches include differentiated offerings anchored on the vectors of filters, variants and packaging formats—Classic Connect, Gold Flake Neo SMART Filter, Gold Flake Kings Mixpod, American Club Smash, Wave Boss and Flake Nova,” ITC said.

“New variants of Flake Excel, Wills Navy Cut Filter, Berkeley Hero were launched in the focus market, while Player’s Chase (multiple variants), Wills Protech, Capstan Excel were launched in line with evolving consumer preferences,” it added.

ITC had witnessed a steady drop in cigarette volumes since the fourth quarter of FY20 (January-March 2021) as the pandemic struck, raising concerns over consumer behaviour towards its mainstay business. In Q4 of FY20, cigarette volumes dropped by 11 percent y-o-y, as shown below. While the largest decline came in the first quarter of FY21 at 37 percent, sequentially, Q2 and Q3 also saw 12 percent and 7 percent drops, respectively. Since the last quarter of FY21, the company has been clocking a stable improvement in cigarette volumes. In the fourth quarter of FY21, it registered 7 percent growth, followed by a 31 percent climb and 9 percent rise in Q1 and Q2 of FY22. The high growth of 31 percent in Q1FY21, however, came on a low base of the corresponding period in FY20 and the volumes still remained below pre-Covid levels.

Analysts are upbeat on ITC’s performance, and not just in cigarettes.

“ITC reported a good quarter with strong performance across segments. We expect ITC (stock) to benefit from (1) expectation of value (on current FCF profile basis) to outperform growth/expensive basket, (2) potential price hikes in cigarettes in the current inflationary environment (better consumer acceptance likely), (3) good underlying performance in the FMCG business along with higher profit (& EVA) focus, and (4) improving outlook for the hotels business (likely cyclical upturn). Besides, focus continues on augmenting (overall) distribution. We see (1) potential market share gains in cigarettes, (2) FMCG scale-up and profitability improvement to continue and (3) potential to accelerate cost savings through a supply chain recast,” said a note from ICICI Securities.

Edelweiss upgraded ITC to ‘buy’ with a revised target price of Rs 285 given its overall limited downside and in the light of i) there being no tax hike for the second consecutive year, making cigarettes more affordable and helping ITC win share from illegal players; ii) stock correction by 11 percent from its peak; iii) 4.5-5 percent dividend yield; and iv) reduced abatement in chewing tobacco, making them more pricey and benefitting cigarettes.

ITC on February 3 reported a 12.7 percent jump in its standalone net profit for the third quarter to Rs 4,156.20 crore compared with Rs 3,687.88 crore posted a year earlier. Its standalone net revenue stood at 15,862.32 crore, 32.5 percent higher than Rs 11,969 crore in Q3FY21."

While its 3Q earnings were in line with our estimates, the likely impact of the Omicron COVID variant on its 4Q earnings has resulted in 6% reduction in its FY22E EPS. There has been no material change in our FY23E and FY24E EPS.  As stated in our detailed note in Nov’21, with the Cigarettes business likely to contribute 80% to ITC's overall EBIT even in FY23E, there is no material reduction in its dependence on this segment, which is beset by concerns of: a) weak EBIT growth for several years now, b) the overhang of a possible GST increase going forward, and c) ESG-related issues over tobacco, leading to a reduction in global valuation multiples.

Outlook

Revenue was higher than our expectations, led by outperformance in the Agri and Hotels businesses, but overall EBITDA and PAT was in line.  Among the internals, the positive surprise was the Cigarette volume growth of 13%. We were expecting some disruption towards the end of 3QFY22 on account of the COVID-led restrictions beginning from the last fortnight of Dec’21. It is true that this growth was on a 7% volume decline. Nevertheless, average Cigarette volume and EBIT growth over the last two-years remains between 2% and 3%. With input costs led pressures weighing on FMCG - Others’ margin YoY, EBIT diversification away from Cigarettes will take time. We maintain our Neutral view.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company post December quarter earnings:

Citi

The research house kept 'neutral' rating on the stock with a target at Rs 245 on the back of a steady Q3FY22 performance.

The cigarette volumes may have now fully recovered to pre-COVID levels, but some volatility due to COVID resurgence/restrictions can’t be ruled out.

No change in taxation in Budget 2022 is a positive factor.

Jefferies

The broking firm has maintained a 'buy' call and raised the target price to Rs 305 from Rs 300 as company reported a strong Q3 led by a beat in four out of five segments.

The cigarette volume growth at 12 percent a surprise, with 2-year CAGR at +2 percent. The input price inflation showed up as FMCG margin contracted, while hotels, paperboard and agri reported a strong YoY EBIT growth.

Jefferies raised EPS estimates by 2-3 percent.

CLSA

The brokerage house has reiterated the 'buy' call with a target at Rs 285.

The improvement in mobility aiding faster recovery and have seen a material topline recovery.

The improved mobility helped accelerate the recovery in cigarette volumes, while hotel and agri revenues doubled and paper showed 39 percent growth.

The FMCG business delivered 9.3 percent topline growth with 9.1 percent EBITDA margin and the company can further build on the volume growth trajectory in cigarettes.

The capital allocation concerns are progressively being addressed.

Prabhudas Lilladher

""We marginally tweak the FY23/24 earnings by 0.3 percent/0.7 percent given, (1) faster-than-expected recovery in cigarette business and (2) strong growth across agri, hotels and paperboard business despite margin setback in FMCG business,"" the analyst firm said.

ITC InfoTech has reported 21 percent/48 percent growth in revenues/net profit for nine months in FY22 aided by improved business mix and higher productivity.

""We expect steady improvement in hotels profitability sans further severe COVID waves, although paper and paperboard margins have peaked out,"" it said.

It has maintained the 'buy' call with an SOTP-based target price of Rs 284 on rollover (Rs 270 earlier).

Sharekhan

Cigarettes business sales volume are expected to improve in the coming quarters. ITC’s management has enhanced focus and redefined growth strategies for all its business vertical to improve growth prospects in the medium to long term.

Strong earnings visibility with improving growth prospects of core cigarette business and margin expansion in non-cigarette FMCG business and a high cash generation ability with strong dividend payout will reduce the valuation gap in the coming years.

""We maintain a 'buy' on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs 280,"" it said.

At 9:18am, ITC was quoting at Rs 236, up Rs 1.70, or 0.73 percent on the BSE.

ITC, the second largest FMCG company in terms of market-capitalisation, is expected to deliver healthy growth in FMCG backed by strong product portfolio and hotels segment with higher mobility, while the cigarette volumes could return to pre-Covid levels in the quarter ended December 2021 on a low base of last year. The company will release earnings scorecard on February 3.

In past few days, the stock has gained nearly 10 percent, partly backed by no change in taxes on tobacco and cigrette in the Union Budget, but since the start of October 2021, it has corrected nearly 2 percent.

Overall, analysts largely expect 6-8 percent growth in revenue and flat to 5 percent year-on-year increase in profit compared to year-ago period. Cigarette volume growth could be in the range of 8-10 percent and FMCG segment may deliver around 9-12 percent growth YoY.

Cigarette business contributed nearly 40 percent and FMCG accounted for 27 percent to total revenue in September 2021 quarter.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects 9 percent YoY growth in cigarette volumes and 10.5 percent YoY growth in cigarette sales aided by 1.5 percent price-mix. ""We forecast 11.4 percent YoY growth in Cigarette EBIT.""

Investec has recommended a buy on the stock with target at Rs 258 per share, an upside of 12 percent from current market price.

Puri is also open to the idea of listing the company’s information technology (IT) businesses — ITC Infotech — as long as it creates sustained value for shareholders.

In a detailed interview, Puri said the company has also not shelved demerger plans for the hotel business. But he wants the market to recover. Puri made it clear that ITC has enough cash for investments but everything will depend on how market forces change over the next few years. Excerpts:

Let’s talk about the key tenets of the “ITC Next Strategy”. What’s in store?

The ‘ITC Next’ strategy focuses on the structural drivers that will power the company’s next horizon of growth and ensure that the enterprise remains future-oriented, consumer-centric and agile. New vectors of growth have been identified for each business to drive scale and profitability.

The key tenets of ‘ITC Next’ include leveraging ITC’s institutional synergies and power brands, a future-ready portfolio to create strong growth platforms, purposeful and agile science-based innovation, and accelerated investments in digital and sustainability. We will also be exploring additional opportunities for growth through value accretive M&As as well as enhanced investments to drive exports. A strategy reset over the last 3-4 years has led to structural interventions to drive margin expansion and capital productivity.

Recognising digital and sustainability as two mega trends that will shape the post-pandemic future, ITC will continue to explore opportunities to craft disruptive business models anchored at the intersection of Digital and Sustainability, leveraging its institutional strengths. We have already articulated a bold and ambitious Sustainability 2.0 Vision to build further on our exemplary ESG performance. The strategy of the organisation has been redefined to build integrated and empowered teams driven by a spirit of professional entrepreneurship — ‘Proneurs’ — that is aimed at sharpening consumer centricity, agility and focus.

How is your FMCG business shaping up? You must have drawn up a plan to drive margin expansion?

ITC has been one of the largest incubators of FMCG brands in India. We have built a portfolio of 25 mother brands that today have a consumer spend of over Rs 22,000 crore. Over the last four years, our revenue from the FMCG business has increased from Rs 10,500 to Rs 15,000 crore with several of ITC’s FMCG brands having already achieved leadership positions.

In the last four years, margins have gone up by 640 basis points through strategic interventions that include product-mix enrichment, bringing in back-end efficiencies, increasing focus on value-added segments and leveraging digital. Sharp-targeted structural interventions encompassing smart sourcing, development of an agile supply chain and robust capacity utilisation through a distributed manufacturing footprint have led to superior back-end efficiencies.

The FMCG portfolio has been revitalised to make it future-ready, address emerging trends and develop categories of the future. Business segments that were incongruent to our growth aspirations have been shrunk. Investments have been made to enable agile and purposeful innovation through identified R&D platforms to power our brands. Besides deepening and widening reach, new routes to market have also been developed, which include strategic partnerships like Amway, a climate controlled supply chain, and scaling up foods services, among others.

ITC has also strengthened its direct-to consumer platform, the ITC e-store, which showcases the wide array in the company’s product portfolio under one roof, besides enabling trend spotting and gaining consumer insights.

So will there be more acquisitions in the FMCG space?

ITC will continue to evaluate value-accretive and synergistic inorganic opportunities as an additional pillar of growth. Acquisitions are guided by considerations such as strategic fit, valuation, financial viability and ease of integration. In recent times, the company has acquired brands such as ‘Savlon’, ‘Nimyle’ and ‘Charmis’ to strengthen its presence in the Personal Care Products Business.

In July 2020, the Company acquired 100 percent of the equity share capital of M/s Sunrise Foods Private Limited (Sunrise), an Indian company primarily engaged in the business of spices. Savlon has grown 14-fold and Nimyle has also grown 5 times since acquisition.



We have identified FMCG segments where there is tremendous headroom to grow given low penetration by branded players. Experts have estimated that the overall addressable market segment for our FMCG portfolio would be about Rs 5 lakh crore by 2035. A multi-pronged approach has been adopted to revitalise the company’s FMCG portfolio. First by fortifying and scaling up our megabrands like Aashirvaad, Sunfeast and others. Secondly by addressing adjacencies through brand extensions, and thirdly by incubating new categories.

The choice of category is guided by its growth prospects, profitability profile and the ability of the company to effectively leverage its institutional strengths with a view to achieving leadership status within a reasonable time-frame. For example, Aashirvaad has emerged as a strong centre-of-plate brand, straddling many value-added categories, including multigrain atta, Superfoods range with multi-millet mix, ragi flour, gluten-free flour, organic atta, vermicelli, ready-to-cook options like poha, upma, suji halwa and so on.

Recognising the undercurrents of hygiene and naturals, our Personal Care Products Business has successfully expanded its portfolio under the ‘Savlon’ and ‘Nimyle’ brands. To address evolving consumer preferences for guilt-free snacking, ITC has launched a delectable range of frozen snacks under the ITC Master Chef brand. A number of new categories have been incubated, including chocolates, coffee, beverages and dairy, among others. The strategy in building such new categories of the future is to first validate the concept and business model in select beachheads and then progressively scale up these segments, creating new vectors of growth for the future.

As I have mentioned earlier, business segments such as LifeStyle Retailing, which are incongruent to our growth plans, have been shrunk.



Recognising the rapid pace and evolution of technology in India, ITC is investing in cutting-edge digital technologies to shape a new paradigm of competitiveness, create innovative business models and leverage newer opportunities. ITC’s digital transformation is being built on a foundation of an agile ‘Digital First’ culture. Accelerated digitalisation is being pursued across the entire value-chain with significant focus on digital marketing, digital commerce, digital products and digital operations.

ITC has, over the last few years, strengthened its engagements in e-commerce. ITC also revamped its direct-to-consumer platform, ‘ITC e-Store’, reaching consumers in 15 metros. The ITC e-Store, currently comprising 800 products across 45+ categories, provides a single platform to showcase the wide array of ITC’s product portfolio. Powered by its ‘Sixth Sense’ Marketing Command Centre, ITC is ahead of the curve in digital marketing with focus on three core pillars, including content, commerce and community.

The company has leveraged relevant technology and digital platforms to deliver meaningful impact in consumer engagement and experience, product development and process efficiencies. ITC is also progressively introducing more ‘digital first’ brands such as Dermafique’ and ‘Fiama’ to leverage the growing e-commerce space. ITC’s digital platforms like the Mangaldeep App, with over 1 million downloads, as well as the first-of-its-kind ‘digital puja’ initiative during the pandemic have also received immense appreciation.

In addition, Classmateshop.com offers mass personalisation of notebook covers as a first-to-market digital initiative. To ensure last-mile connectivity for all our distributors and uninterrupted supply of products to consumers, we have also developed apps like UNNATI (eB2B App) and VIRU (Virtual Salesman App), which facilitate digital ordering and end-to-end trade engagements.



The hospitality business, which was significantly impacted by the pandemic, had begun to witness a recovery. However, fresh restrictions following the new wave may cause further disruptions in the short term. For accelerated growth, we have adopted an asset right approach for the hospitality business wherein a large part of incremental room additions is expected to accrue through management contracts.

We have also renovated the Welcomhotel brand, and this portfolio of owned and managed properties will move up to 25 by the end of this year. The Business has also launched two new brands — ‘Storii’ for curated nature-based experiences and ‘Mementos’ which is a collection of unique luxury hotels across varied destinations. Already, four MOUs have been signed under the Storii brand and thee properties have been onboarded under Mementos.

Responding to the challenges and disruptions arising out of the pandemic, our Hotels Business has launched a host of curated offerings that will leverage and sweat existing assets besides augmenting new revenue streams. These include the introduction of innovative staycation packages and in-home dining offerings such as ‘Gourmet Couch’ and ‘Flavours’. Recently, the Business also piloted a signature ‘Sleeep Boutique’, leveraging extensive research to ensure superior experiences to discerning guests in this crucial area.

The business continues to leverage digital investments towards facilitating guest acquisition, enhancing the guest experience, augmenting revenue generation and driving operational efficiency.

What are the new levers of growth for your agri business?

ITC, as you are aware, has a large footprint in the Indian agricultural space. Our deep engagement in the agricultural sector through the ITC e-Choupal, has led to the empowerment of over 4 million farmers. As part of the ITC Next strategy, ITC is pursuing accelerated value addition anchored on NextGeneration Agriculture to build yet another pillar of growth. The objective is to foster demand-responsive value chains, promote climate-smart agriculture and digitally empower farmers.

ITC is working with farmers to develop robust models for value-added segments, such as food-safe IPM Chillies, organic mango pulp traceable to farms, specialty coffee certified for fair trade, end-use-specific wheat flours, medicinal and aromatic plant extracts and so on. Going forward, the company proposes to foster inclusive agri value-chains through nearly 4,000 FPOs, benefiting around 10 million farmers across multiple crop clusters.

To bring the power of cutting-edge digital technologies to farmers, ITC will launch a Super App during the year, called ITC-MAARS — Metamarket for Advanced Agriculture and Rural Services. Accordingly, a new vertical has been created in the business. ITC-MAARS will offer a full complement of agricultural solutions while its micro-services structure will enable plug-ins by a range of agtech solutions.

This will be delivered through a robust ‘phygital’ ecosystem. Some pilots at scale on an integrated chilli value-chain initiated in Andhra Pradesh have validated the concept and benefited farmers with an additional income of 26 percent in the ongoing season.

ITC Infotech seems to have delivered a strong performance over the last couple of years. What are your strategic areas of focus for this business?

We remain deeply committed to this business. The recent disruptions in digital technologies lend immense opportunities for agile players like ITC Infotech that possess domain-centric depth and capabilities. Living by its credo of offering business-friendly solutions, sharper focus is being provided in its chosen areas of specialisation such as Automation, Cloud-based Services, Digital Banking, Smart Manufacturing and Digital Workplace among others. The pillars of operational excellence and customer centricity have led to an encouraging performance with the EBITDA margin growing from 8 percent to 25.2 percent from FY19 to FY21.

Can you elaborate on your plans for the Paperboards business? Is it easy to drive revenue and profitability?

Our Paperboards business has made significant progress in recent years with strategic investments in areas such as pulp import substitution, proactive capacity augmentation in the Value Added Paperboards segment where ITC is a distinct leader, as well as in decarbonisation of operations. As part of the ITC Next horizon, the focus is on three key vectors — value-added paperboards, where we are a distinct market leader, cutting-edge innovation in sustainable packaging to substitute single-use plastics, and investment in digital technologies like Industry 4.0, AI, ML and advanced analytics to drive process and operational efficiencies.

In sustainable packaging, the business has introduced an innovative portfolio comprising recyclable paperboards under the ‘FiloPack’ and ‘FiloServe’ series and biodegradable paperboards in the ‘OmegaBev’ and ‘OmegaBarr’ series. The business is also developing antiviral and anti-microbial paper for applications in pharma and the education & stationery businesses, as well as moulded fibre-based products that are biodegradable and compostable.



We are sharply focused on creating long-term sustained value for stakeholders, delivering superior performance and enhancing competitiveness of each business. During the three pre-pandemic years from FY17 to FY20, ITC’s EPS grew by 47 percent. Return on Segment Capital Employed has moved up from 61 percent in 2017 to 72 percent in 2020. A strategy reset with structural interventions has been put in place to sustain higher levels of competitiveness, growth and profitability.

As I have mentioned earlier in this interview, we are building an FMCG business at scale leveraging unique enterprise strengths, purposeful innovation, investments in digitalisation amongst others.

In other segments like Agriculture and Paperboards, we continue to strengthen our leadership position and build new levers of growth and competitiveness. Overall, the focus will continue to be on enabling sustained long-term value creation for shareholders.

We have embarked on an ambitious journey for the future and I am confident that the ‘ITC Next’ strategy will provide new wings to the company to make it even more agile, resilient, innovative and compassionate."

"January 09, 2022 05:59 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/lifestyle-trends/fine-dining-came-home-during-the-pandemic-no-more-soggy-salad-or-pizza-within-minutes-of-delivery-7915801.html,"(Representational image) Fine-dining restaurants place as much importance on the venue, ambience, service and presentation as the food itself. During the pandemic, they had to adapt to stay afloat.

Just a couple of weeks into the national lockdown in March 2020, IHCL, the holding company of luxury hotel brands such as Taj, figured that if it had any hope of doing business in the coming months, it would have to find a way to home deliver food from its many award-winning restaurants. Hotel stays were down to zero and were likely going to stay that way, so restaurants were the key source of income now.

Fine-dining restaurants, especially the kinds that are part of luxury hotel chains, place as much importance on the venue, ambience, service, presentation, etc., as on the food itself. It also isn’t unusual for a fine-dining restaurants to refuse requests to pack leftovers to preserve the sanctity of the dish. So, the very idea of running a fine-dining business on the same model as a roadside delivery restaurant was unthinkable. Then again, so was the idea of the entire world grinding to a halt.

Taj would go on to launch Qmin, an app that would home-deliver food from its restaurants. Other hotel chains such as ITC and Marriot also launched their food-delivery services, albeit through phone calls and WhatsApp messages. For anyone remotely connected to the food and beverage (F&B) industry, it was evident that to survive, they’d have to home deliver their food, fine dining or not.

For Gauri Devidayal, director of Food Matters, the company that runs a handful of restaurants including The Table, a fine-dining restaurant, and Mag St Kitchen, a cool experimental space, an unlikely opportunity presented itself.

Mag St Bread Co started out as a bakery supplying breads and other basic baked goods to some of the best-known cafes and restaurants in Mumbai. With the 2020 lockdown causing restaurants to shut down, Mag St Bread Co’s business was affected, too, at first. “But as soon as delivery of essential items was allowed, the demand for breads and baked goods increased,” Devidayal recollects. And just like that, a brand that was essentially B2B (business to business), began retailing to individual customers. “For a while, Mag St Bread Co was our only fully-functional brand,” she says.

The unexpected success of Mag St Bread Co made Devidayal realise that she’d have to make the menus of some of her other restaurants delivery-friendly, too. This was easier to do for some restaurants; for others, it took a little creative thinking.

Devidayal relaunched Miss T, an Asian restaurant that boasted of a cool mixology programme but had shut long before the pandemic, as a delivery kitchen. The drinks went out but gyozas, sobas, pho bowls, and salads stayed. “But instead of just sending them as a regular delivery restaurant would, we packed the ingredients separately with assembly and/or heating instructions,” she says. This ensured that ingredients in dishes such as salads or pho, remained fresh, didn’t get soggy, and the diner could have their meal by assembling it at their convenience instead of gulping it down as soon as it arrived.

Devidayal followed the same model for her other restaurants including The Table, whose original menu was not designed for delivery. “We launched a separate delivery-only menu with dishes we knew could travel and relied on our customers to follow the DIY assembly instructions,” she says. Today, all of Devidayal’s restaurants home deliver, some even as far as Alibaug, a 50-minute ferry-ride across the Arabian Sea.

The moment the home delivery option was turned on, it freed up restaurateurs to think beyond their pre-existing menus. The field was wide open. For Devidayal it meant launching Mag St Pizza Co, a gourmet pizza brand that likely wouldn’t have opened if it weren’t for the pandemic.

Pizza was also the direction which restaurateur A.D. Singh took when it came to home delivery. Singh runs Olive Bar and Kitchen, with restaurants in most Indian metropolises. After experimenting with social distancing using mannequins in designer outfits and creating booths around tables, and offering chef-at-home services, Singh is launching Olive Pizzeria. The gourmet pizza kitchen will add to his roster of brands like Fatty Bao that already deliver nationally and by his own account “helped us reach some level of survival during the pandemic”.

With Olive Pizzeria, Singh’s aim is to not just create recipes that can travel better but also create packaging that survives the journey and stands out in his diners’ memory. Branding, he says, is key.

Also building menus for delivery and rethinking packaging is Radhika Dhariwal, co-founder of Passcode Hospitality that’s best known for launching PCO, a speakeasy in Delhi, in 2012.

Curating the right menu was easy for some of Passcode Hospitality's restaurants like Pings, an Asian street food restaurant that lends itself to delivery. For others, like SAZ, a brasserie specialising in elevated American cuisine, it was a little difficult. So, like Devidayal and Singh, she leaned in on traditional favourites that she knew would get picked up easily and would travel well. In the case of SAZ this included pastas, pizzas, soups, sandwiches, and burgers.

Besides curating the menus, Dhariwal and her team also spent time developing packaging: think eco-friendly boxes, cloth bags that could be reused. “Because in-home dining experience can’t just be about the food,” she says. “It has to be exciting in that it should bring as much of the restaurant and its philosophy as possible to the diner’s home.”

In this, Zorawar Kalra agrees with Singh and Dhariwal.

Kalra owns Massive Restaurants that runs over 32 restaurants across the country and a few overseas too. He says, “We’ve spent a lot of time and money in developing packaging for the meals we home deliver. Sushis go with gel packs, burgers go in boxes with magnets, etc. A lot of thought has gone into the look and quality of each packaging because it’s the best way to showcase your brand and give your customers a high-end experience at home.”

During this time, Kalra has also launched two delivery-only brands – Louis Burger and Butter Delivery. He’s been bullish on cloud kitchen for the higher return on investment (ROI) it tends to fetch compared with a brick-and-mortar restaurant.

“If there is a third wave (of Covid-19),” Kalra says, “it will be devastating to the restaurant industry. Cloud kitchens help make organisations leaner, control expenditure and so cloud is an important play for us.”

It isn’t surprising, therefore, that Kalra is looking to raise fresh capital to expand his cloud kitchen footprint to a dozen new cities by the end of March 2022.

Kalra has been heralding the end of fine-dining culture and the beginning of the gourmet comfort food trend. “The age of fine dining is coming to an end,” he told me somewhat dramatically in 2019 at the launch of Younion a hip bar that was clearly aimed at Gen Z and millennials. To be sure, he hasn’t launched a new fine-dining brand since, but a large part of his empire does comprise those restaurants. And like everyone else, he’s had to rethink his menu along the lines of what can travel and what can’t. While he doesn’t get into the details of how much tweaking he’s had to make to each of his menus, he says that sometimes it involves changing the cooking process of some dishes “like double frying something so it doesn’t get chewy by the time it reaches you”.

Today, delivery contributes anywhere between 20% and 35% to the businesses of those with whom we spoke, a sharp rise from a meagre 5-10% at the beginning of 2020. But everyone agrees that it can likely never replace in-restaurant dining.

Kalra, somewhat dramatically, calls restaurant dining the last bastion of human interaction. But Sanjay Vazirani, who runs restaurants such as China Bistro, India Bistro, and Glocal Junction, says, “Convenience will be key, and the focus will have to be on building out hybrid models of restaurants.”

So, while like the others, Vazirani has also curated special delivery menus and put a lot of thought in packaging, he’s also repurposing a part of his restaurant kitchens to support newer delivery-only brands like Art of Dum.

“Experiential brands like Glocal Junction (a sprawling, all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant chain) will rely on in-restaurant diners, but we also have to acknowledge that a lot of people may not want to have comprehensive meals. So, we see an enormous potential in delivery too,” he says, adding that there’s no easy answer to what the future holds. “We’ll have to be agile and shift our SOPs (standard operating procedures) as per the needs and expectations of the times.”

Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) makers are bracing for inflation in key inputs in 2022, but expect it to be offset by strong demand for their products in the coming year.

Two major trends in 2022 will be an uptick in discretionary spending and consumer movement towards branded products, several companies in the FMCG sector told Moneycontrol.

“While we expect the overall inflationary trends to continue, the discretionary spends have picked up in the last few quarters. In the last six-eight months, we have seen a good uptick in categories like snacks, juices, premium biscuits, deodorants, and premium soaps. We see this trend continuing in the upcoming year as well,” said an ITC spokesperson.

Inflation lingers

FMCG companies have been battling price inflation in several key commodities such as palm oil, tea and packaging material since the onset of the pandemic. In 2021, the prices of most commodities rose to unprecedented levels.

“Edible oils climbed by 50-60 percent, wheat prices went up by 10-12 percent, packaging material costs, because of the rise in crude prices, rose by 20-24 percent and freight charges jumped by 17-18 percent in the last on year,” said Mayah Shah, senior category head at Parle Products Pvt. Ltd.

As a result, he said, you see inflation in one or two products, but this kind of price rise across commodities become difficult to handle.

Shah expects the situation to continue unabated in the coming months.

“We don’t see prices going down; prices of most commodities will continue to climb,” he added.

Asheesh Sharma, vice president of marketing at Agro Tech Foods Ltd, believes the prices of locally-sourced commodities will come down at the start of the financial year 2023; prices of imported commodities such as edible oils will take time to subside.

Rural India to bounce back?

Rural India, which proved to be a life-saver for FMCG companies as urban India struggled with disruptions due to the lockdowns and two waves of the pandemic, showed signs of plateauing in the second quarter of the financial year 2022.

According to data, insights and consulting company Kantar Group, rural areas reported 1.5 percent growth in the September quarter compared to 4.5 percent growth in the year-ago period.

Companies such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd were hurt by the slowdown.

“Rural demand in the past few quarters has been resilient thanks to government initiatives such as higher spending on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, food subsidies, direct cash transfers to farmers and a decent harvest,” said Sanjiv Mehta, chairman and managing director of HUL, India’s largest FMCG company.

“Now, as mobility improves and urban markets see a pick-up, rural centres, though they are still growing, their growth rates have moderated,” he said.

FMCG companies expect this to be a minor blip and predict that the hinterland would bounce back in the coming year.

“We expect rural to continue to show resilience given the increased government spending in rural and agri-sector in FY 2021-22 and the multiplier effect it will have on the rural economy going forward,” said the ITC spokesperson.

Discretionary categories to lead

Consumer goods companies like ITC and Agro Tech Foods project that discretionary categories will continue to lead the segment in 2022. Agro Tech, in fact, is betting on its newly launched products in the non-essential segments to revive its margins.

“We see a significant opportunity in both our cereals and chocolates categories we have entered into with our superior differentiated offerings and therefore the ability to fully harness the benefit of superior margins offered by these categories,” said Sharma of Agro Tech.

Analysts concur. A recent note by ICICI Securities said: “Companies operating in the discretionary category will maintain a better growth trajectory in 2022 driven by factors such as sharp demand recovery (mostly priced in), store expansion and (some) cost efficiencies driving operating leverage and industry tailwinds (QSR, jewellery). “ QSR is short for quick-service restaurants.

The brokerage has a neutral stance on staples. “Demand uncertainty during periods of high inflation is a tough challenge to navigate as companies look to manage growth and margins,” it wrote.

“Peak margins for most with increasing salience of e-commerce and modern trade likely means years of margin headwinds for FMCG. We reckon most companies are getting distracted from their core agenda of penetration-driven growth as they worry about disruption in all facets of operations. That said, we expect the industry formalisation thesis to sustain,” ICICI Securities wrote about companies operating in the staples category."

Diversified entity ITC Ltd on Thursday said it has collaborated with Invest India, a non-profit venture by the central government for national investment promotion and facilitation, to crowdsource innovative ideas for single-use plastic substitution and automate waste segregation.

Under the collaboration, ITC Paperboards and Specialty Papers Division (PSPD) has launched the ITC Sustainability Innovation Challenge, which would support innovative startup ideas on sustainable packaging and smart waste management solutions, the company said in a statement.

As part of the initiative, through the Startup India portal, ITC PSPD is inviting responses from startups towards challenges laid out by the company to find sustainable and smart technology-based solutions that can substitute single-use plastics and automate waste segregation process with smart technology-based solutions to improve efficiency and speed.

ITC PSPD CEO Vadiraj Kulkarni said the disposal of plastic and non-biodegradable waste continues to pose the biggest challenge in solid waste management in India. The problem is further aggravated due to inefficient segregation of post-consumer waste at the source, which leads to a lot of waste ending up in landfills that are highly polluting.

''We, at ITC, believe that businesses, both big and small, with their immense managerial and innovative capacity, can come together to contribute significantly towards finding innovative and sustainable packaging and waste management solutions, leading to transformative changes in the society,'' Kulkarni added.

Invest India Managing Director and CEO Deepak Bagla said, ''We look forward to accelerating efforts towards a more sustainable economic growth through the ITC Innovative Sustainability Challenge. Innovative startups will be able to showcase Made-in-India solutions that propel India towards a circular economy''.

ITC said for sustainable packaging it is inviting ideas to replace plastic-based products with compostable food delivery solutions, using molded fibre packaging based on wood fibre, agri-waste etc. It is also looking for solutions under recyclable and/or compostable barrier coatings for the papers and paperboards category.

As for waste segregation, collection, and handling, the focus is on innovative and technology-based solutions for managing household and municipal waste based on different material types, such as paper, metal, glass and rigid plastic. ''The ideas must include an effective revenue model for the waste management ecosystem and lead to significant incremental benefits over prevailing methods as the desired outcome from the solutions,'' it added."
"December 24, 2021 08:19 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/msmes-fear-harassment-misuse-of-power-by-officials-under-new-gst-regime-7862571.html,"Small businesses are fearing increased harassment by tax officials in the New Year when the amended Goods and Services Tax (GST) rules will come into effect. The rules were amended to empower GST officials to initiate recovery proceedings against businesses without providing a show-cause notice for any mismatches in forms GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B.

Until now, the tax officials were required to issue show-cause notices before initiating recovery proceedings.

The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) recently notified January 1, 2022, as the effective date for implementation of this new rule. Several other changes will also come into effect from that day. The changes meant to tighten the tax regime were announced in the Union Budget for 2021-22. The amended rules were notified only on December 21.

The move is aimed at curbing instances of fake billing by the buyers whereby the sellers show high sales under the GSTR-1. Such practices allow buyers to claim input tax credits (ITC) and underreport sales in the GSTR-3B form to reduce their GST liability.

The original Central GST Act provided for forms GSTR-1 for details of outward supplies, GSTR-2 for inward supplies data or purchases made, and GSTR-3, a document containing electronically collated details of all transactions in a particular month, filed in GSTR-1 and GSTR-2, and tax liability.

However, associations representing the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and legal experts fear that the new stricter form of GST may lead to misuse of power and harassment by the authorities.

They observed that the incoming stricter GST rules would not only increase the compliances and litigations for the MSMEs but will also lead to harassment at the hands of tax authorities.

Fear of harassment, misuse of power

Rakesh Chhabra, Vice President, Federation of Indian Micro and Small & Medium Enterprises (FISME) observed that businesses will face harassment by the tax authorities even in the instances wherein an honest clerical error has occurred causing a mismatch in the forms. This, he said, would ultimately lead to expensive court proceedings forcing the sellers to shut shop.

""The government itself has been having problems with its tax portal for so many months. Can a clerical error not happen by the MSMEs?"" questioned Chhabra.

An MSME entrepreneur from Coimbatore who did not wish to be named said, ""The government has been saying so many things about bringing ease of doing businesses. But this is just the opposite of it, more like inspector raj.""

The entrepreneur feared that in the instance of mismatch, the tax authorities will not give notice and instead arrive at the factories unannounced to harass.

Vinod Kumar, president of India SME Forum said that the incoming rule would give exclusive power to the officials in the GST department because the new system does not delve into the reasons behind the mismatch in the forms.

He explained that there are several instances wherein the buyers return the products to the seller and demand a refund. However, the same would not reflect in the form GSTR-3B which had originally captured the transaction. This, he said, would result in a mismatch in the two forms which would ultimately invite the tax authorities despite no fault on the part of the seller.

""So while the seller has to give a refund to the buyer, he will also be forced to give the GST on the same transaction,"" said Kumar.

Right to hearing

Sameer Jain, Managing Partner, PSL Advocates & Solicitors said, ""The mismatch can be for various reasons, some of which are explainable. Not issuing a notice essentially takes away a right of hearing where an assessee has an opportunity to explain its position qua non-payment and/ or mismatch.""

Sharing a similar sentiment, Ashok Saigal, Co-Chairman at CII’s (Confederation of Indian Industry) National MSME Council noted that the new rules go against the natural course of justice where the seller would not even get the opportunity to make his argument.

""Ultimately, the MSMEs would have to bear the brunt because they don't have the right infrastructure or a computerised system unlike the big businesses to keep a check of all the transactions and invoices. Moreover, genuine clerical mishaps can happen,"" he said."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC’s first Investor meet highlighted strategic growth drivers and its strategy around ESG principles. ITC is committed to sustain growth across key segments led by cross segment synergies, innovation, digital, GTM initiatives and entry in new categories. ITC is committed to asset light business model in Hotels and value unlocking in FMCG, although no concrete road map was disappointing for investors who have been pinning hopes for the same. We believe ITC will target aggressive organic and inorganic growth in ITC Infotech given huge growth opportunity with little chances of any demerger or listing in near term. We believe FMCG and IT Services will unlock maximum value for shareholders over the years, with no short cuts in near term.

Outlook

we remain positive on business strategy, although uncertainty on cigarette taxation and global aversion to investment in Tobacco stocks remains an overhang. ITC trades at 16.3x Sept23 EPS, with ~4.5% dividend yield and 10.7% EPS CAGR over FY21-24, 55% discount to coverage universe. Maintain BUY with SOTP based target price of Rs270.

Outlook

Management seems open to acquisitions in FMCG/IT and exploring unlocking potential at an opportune time, which could be a positive catalyst. Maintain Buy with a TP of Rs270.

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

ITC eyes double-digit revenue growth and higher PAT growth in the medium term with sustained margin expansion riding on six core growth strategies of leveraging on institutional strengths, innovation, digitalisation, cost optimisation, sustainability and creating a strong talent base. Capex of Rs. 10,000 crore has been lined up over three years of which 35-40% will be ploughed into the FMCG business. Hotel business would stay asset-light and ITC would raise investments on digitalisation and inorganic initiatives in medium term. Management is committed to restructure hotel business after an overall recovery while it will evaluate unlocking value in the infotech and FMCG business once it attains scale. However there is not stated timeline for same.



Outlook

With strong cash flow generation, ITC’s dividend payout would stay at 80-85%. Stock continues to trade at a discounted valuation of 16.3x/14.6x its FY2023/24E EPS. We maintain our Buy on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs. 280.

Cigarette major ITC's shares rose in early trade on December 15 after the company discussed taxation on cigarette business, demerger plans and the strategy for the FMCG business in its first ever investor meet on December 14.

In the investor meet, ITC’s top management stressed that the health ministry makes regular recommendations annually, as it tried to allay concerns about higher taxation on its mainstay cigarettes business.

“We expect a rational decision by the government after considering all aspects and expect any increase in taxation to be well spaced out in any case,” said ITC Chairman Sanjiv Puri, according to analysts who attended the event.

The company’s demerger plans and its strategy for the FMCG business were other highlights of the occasion, analysts told Moneycontrol.

Puri indicated the company is open to look at a demerger of the FMCG business or a separate listing of its IT business to unlock further potential. He also talked about demerger plans for the company's hotel business, which will be looked at once the hospitality industry recovers.

The company has set a Rs 1 trillion revenue by FY30 for its FMCG business, and Puri said the company is committed to building a large FMCG business in the country.

The company also said it will invest Rs 10,000 crore in the next three years to create growth vectors. Of this, 35-40 percent would go towards FMCG capacity expansion, while 25-30 percent will be in ITC Paperboards.

About 10 percent of the capital would be spent on completing its major hotel projects and the rest will be to build digital capabilities.

ITC’s top management discussed taxation on cigarette business, demerger plans and the strategy for the FMCG business going ahead in its first-ever investor meet on December 14, said analysts. The company’s top management stressed that the health ministry makes regular recommendations annually, as it tried to allay concerns about higher taxation on its mainstay cigarettes business.

“I hope a reasonable perspective emerges out of all the deliberations and expect any increase in taxation to be well spaced out in any case,” said ITC Chairman Sanjiv Puri, according to analysts attending the event. He also highlighted that the health ministry's recommendation this time is much wider and covers tobacco products other than cigarettes as well.

Investors have been worried about ITC’s performance since the government formed an expert panel to prepare a tax policy on all tobacco products. A decline in cigarette consumption globally has also been concerning investors. However, Puri said sales volumes for cigarettes are already back to pre-pandemic levels. Though there have been significant disruptions in categories like cigarettes since the pandemic's onset, it has now recovered well, said the executive. ITC expects to gain market share due to government's action on illicit cigarettes given the taxation remains stable.

The company’s demerger plans and its strategy for FMCG business were other highlights of the occasion, analysts told Moneycontrol. Puri indicated the company is open to look at a demerger of FMCG business or a separate listing of IT business to unlock further potential. He also talked about the demerger plans of its hotel business and said the company plans an action once the hospitality industry recovers.

FMCG: A key growth lever

During the event, analysts said the company discussed its plans for FMCG business at length. ITC said it is looking for merger and acquisition opportunities, especially, for its FMCG business after seeing a good performance of its recent acquisitions -- Savlon, Nimyle, Sunrise. The company has set a Rs 1 trillion revenue by FY30 for its FMCG business and Puri said the company is committed to building a large FMCG business in the country.

The company also discussed its investment plan, under which it plans to invest Rs 10,000 crore in the next three years to create growth vectors. Of this, 35-40 percent would go towards FMCG capacity expansion, while 25-30 percent towards ITC Paperboards. About 10 percent of the capital would be spent on completing its major hotel projects and the rest of the sum on building digital capabilities.

Under its FMCG plan, Puri outlined, the company will continue to scale and fortify power brands and leverage them to address adjacencies. “We will continue having regionally strong brands and building segments of the future to achieve ambitious FMCG plans,” he said.

ITC also discussed inflation and the stress on its margins due to high input costs during the event. The company’s management said that though it is witnessing unprecedented inflation in edible oil, palm oil, packaging, it has been able to sustain 9 percent EBITDA margins in the first half of FY22.

Other businesses

ITC has witnessed a strong recovery in the hotel business with improvement in consumer sentiment and mobility. Leisure travel, it indicated, is doing well but business travel is still weak and is currently at 40-50 percent of the pre-COVID levels. However, hotel occupancy, ITC said, is already back to pre-pandemic levels and it expects the third quarter to be better than the second quarter for its hotel business.

Giving an outlook for its infotech business, the company said it sees tremendous potential in the IT business, especially, in the current environment."

Nifty seems to have halted its fall, at for now. It found support near the 16,891-mark on December 6, 2021, and since then it has been moving higher.

The price action on the shorter time frame suggests that currently the prices are moving out of a range (16,782-17,490) and attempting to move higher.

On the options open interest front, (December 16, 2021) highest open interest addition was seen in the 18,500 Call and 2nd highest open interest addition was seen in the 17,200 Put contracts, thus we can expect the broader range of the index to be 17,200-18,500.

We believe that in the sessions to come, the prices might continue to hover around the 20-week SMA (17,344) and might remain rangebound between 17,200 (multiple touch point levels) and 17,800 (3-week high). If the prices breach above the 17,800-mark, we might see a move towards the 18,500 (multiple touch point level) and 18,600 (previous swing high) level.

The key level to watch for on the downside will be the 17,200 level. If the prices breach below the 17,200 we might see a drop towards 17,000 (psychological support level) and 16,800 (recent swing low) mark.

Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:

Aditya Birla Capital: Buy | LTP: Rs 124.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 115 | Target: Rs 161 | Return: about 29% from the current level.

Aditya Birla Capital for the past 9 months had been moving lower in well-channelized manner. In the week starting November 29, 2021, the prices not only broke but also closed above the upper trend line of the channel. In the current week, the prices managed to sustain above the previous week high and move higher.

On the indicator front, the RSI (relative strength index) plotted on the weekly chart can be seen moving higher towards the overbought level, indicating increasing bullish momentum in the prices.

Looking at the prices action and the technical parameters mentioned above we expect Aditya Birla Capital to move higher immediately towards Rs 149, post which we might see the prices test Rs 161.

Aditya Birla Capital seems to be a good buying candidate with upside targets of Rs 149 and Rs 161, we recommend a stop loss level of Rs 115 on daily closing basis for this setup.

ITC: Buy | CMP: Rs 235.40 | Stop-Loss: Rs 215 | Target: Rs 282 | Return: 20 percent

ITC on the short term time frame can be seen moving higher after finding support near the Rs 217 mark on December 6, 2021.

The stock gained momentum on December 9 and managed to capture the 20-week SMA (simple moving average).

On the indicator front, the RSI plotted on the weekly time frame witnessed a range shift and has been above the 50 mark since November 2020 with mild whipsaws. Currently it is placed above the 50 mark and is moving higher towards the overbought level, indicating increasing bullishness in the trend.

The prices action and the technical parameters mentioned above point towards the possibility of the prices moving higher towards the Rs 259 mark. If the prices sustain above Rs 259 mark we might see the prices move higher towards the Rs 282 and Rs 310 eventually.

ITC is currently bouncing off a support level and is moving higher. So the risk-reward level is very favourable for an investor. One can buy ITC at current levels and hold it with a target of Rs 259 and Rs 282 with a strict stop-loss of Rs 215 on daily closing basis.

Zee Entertainment Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 367.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 333 | Target: Rs 440 | Return: 20 percent

Zee Entertainment Enterprises for the past couple of months has been drifting higher after finding support near the Rs 285 mark. In the week started December 6, 2021 the prices gained momentum and managed to move and close above the previous swing high of Rs 362.

The RSI plotted on the weekly chart can be seen moving higher as the prices resume its uptrend after a correction, indicating increasing bullish momentum as the prices resume its up move after a correction.

The momentum indicators and the technical parameters all point towards the possibility of the prices moving higher towards the Rs 406 mark immediately. If this level is breached, we might see the prices move towards Rs 440-480 level eventually.

Our bullish view will be negated if the prices breach below Rs 333. We also recommend this level to be a strict stop loss on closing basis.

The market continued its uptrend for the third consecutive session with a third of a percent gains on December 9. The BSE Sensex rallied more than 150 points to close tad above 58,800 levels, and the Nifty50 gained 47 points to end above 17,500 mark. The indices gained 3.6 percent each in the last three sessions.

The broader markets outpaced the benchmark indices. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices have registered 0.6 percent and 1.24 percent gains.

ITC was the biggest gainer in the Nifty50, rising 4.65 percent, to Rs 235.40. Telecom operator Vodafone Idea topped the futures and options segment, hitting nearly 32-month high of Rs 16.70 before ending the session with 14.69 percent at Rs 16.40. ABB India hit a new peak of Rs 2,375 on Thursday, before climbing 9.92 percent to close at Rs 2,300.40.

Here’s what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

ITC

From the level of Rs 245, the stock witnessed short-term price correction of over 10 percent. After a sharp fall, finally it took support near Rs 220 and reversed sharply.

Momentum indicators and reversal formation indicate strong possibility of further uptrend, if it succeeds to trade above Rs 229 support level.

For the positional traders, Rs 229 would act as a sacrosanct support level. Above this, the uptrend formation wave will continue up to Rs 245-258.

Vodafone Idea

In this month so far, the stock has rallied nearly 50 percent. After a short-term correction, one more time the stock took the support near 50-day SMA (simple moving average) and reversed sharply.

On the weekly charts, it has formed a strong bullish breakout continuation which supports further uptrend. On daily and intraday charts, the stock has formed promising higher bottom series pattern that also support short-term uptrend.

For the swing traders, now Rs 15 and Rs 14.20 could be the key level to watch if the stock manages to trade above the same, then we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 18-19.5. On the flip side, below Rs 14, the uptrend would be vulnerable.

ABB India

After a short-term correction, the stock took support near 50-day SMA. Through the last couple of weeks, the stock hovered in the range of Rs 2,050-2,150.

On Thursday, it opened with a strong note and not only cleared the resistance of Rs 2,050 but succeeded to close above the same which is broadly positive. A strong bullish candle on daily and weekly charts along with incremental volume activity clearly indicate further uptrend from current levels.

For the breakout traders, now Rs 2,200 would be the trend decider level. As long as it trades above the same, the breakout texture will continue up to Rs 2,500-2,635.

Diversified entity ITC on Thursday confirmed that it is developing a nasal spray for COVID-19 prevention for which it has initiated clinical trials.

Developed by scientists at ITC Life Sciences and Technology Centre (LSTC), Bengaluru, the company plans to market the nasal spray under the Savlon brand once it gets all the requisite regulatory approvals, according to sources.

When contacted for comments, a spokesperson of ITC said, ""We are unable to share more details at the current moment as the clinical trials are underway.""

The spokesperson declined to comment on a detailed query on where is the clinical trial being done, from where the commercial production would be done when approved and under what brand the nasal spray would be marketed.

However, sources said the company had received approvals from ethics committees and is registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI) for clinical trials of the nasal spray which is designed to arrest the virus at the entry point in the nasal cavity itself.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

They further said the product has the potential to be effective and safe in preventing infection and transmission of COVID-19 along with the existing measures of hygiene recommended by health authorities.

ITC’s LSTC has been at the core of the company’s drive for science led product innovation to support and build its wide range of product portfolio.

The company’s R&D teams were instrumental in developing a range of innovative health and hygiene offerings that were commercially made available under the Savlon brand, during the pandemic."

Motilal Oswal's research report on ITC

Tapering in-home consumption and sharp commodity cost inflation could affect strong EBIT growth in the Other FMCG segment, preventing the contribution of Cigarettes in overall EBIT to decline much (likely to reduce to ~80% in FY23E which is still within its ten-year range of 80-86%). Cigarette volumes for ITC and even other players globally have been on a declining trend, given the increased health consciousness among consumers over the last decade. With the government having recently (Oct'21) set up an expert panel tasked with preparing a comprehensive tax policy proposal for all forms of tobacco from a public health perspective, the overhang of a policy change that may affect cigarette volumes remains on the stock. The rumored demerger of ITC Infotech, even at INR200-250b, is only 6-8% of ITC's current market capitalization and is partly factored in the price already. In our opinion, it does not portend demerger of other FMCG or the Hotels business in the near term, nor does it reduce the dependence on its Cigarette EBIT.

Outlook

We value ITC at 15x Dec'23E EPS and maintain our TP of INR240/share and our Neutral rating.

[Representative image]

In its latest bid to expand its FMCG business, ITC has forayed into the Indian breakfast category with a ready-to-cook and ready-to-mix range and staples under the household brand ""Aashirvaad"".

ITC's food business chief Hemant Malik told The Economic Times that the company had launched breakfast staples including rawa, suji and vermicelli.

They will also introduce categories such as dalia, poha and millet cereals.

With this foray, the company will compete with established brands such as Kellogg, Nestle, MTR and Gits Food in the segment.

""Aashirvaad has largely been a brand with products for meal occasions, be it atta, salt, pulses or ghee. We are extending the brand into other value-added segments with which one can cook breakfast or snacks,"" the report said quoting Malik.

""Some of these categories have huge scope and have the capacity to generate good margins by leveraging our scale, wheat adjacencies and supply chain efficiency,"" Malik added.

ITC's non-cigarette FMCG business contributed to 27 percent of the company's overall revenue in Q2 FY22 at Rs 4,036 crore, whereas its cigarettes business contributed to 38 percent of revenue at Rs 5,642 crore. The non-cigarette FMCG segment revenue grew 23 percent on year and 8% percenton quarter.

According to the Economic Times report, the breakfast staples market in India has a potential of over Rs 100 crore, at a CAGR of 12 percent.

In the ready-to-cook category, it has launched idli sambhar, upma, instant poha, instant suji halwa, idli and dosa instant mixes.

""The category expansion of Aashirvaad will help to premiumise the portfolio. We want the brand to play in the Indian cuisine space in breakfast and not western cereals like oats,"" Malik said to the publication."
"November 20, 2021 08:23 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/industry-view-on-farm-laws-repeal-some-say-not-much-impact-others-rue-lost-opportunity-7739911.html,"Farmers protest against new agri laws. Representative image (Image: Reuters)

The government’s decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws may not negatively impact business on the ground because they were not actively implemented in the first place, said industry executives.

""The three farm laws repealed by the central government, were not executed on the ground level like the government had intended when they were introduced in 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and farmer agitations across the country. Hence, their repeal will not have a major impact,"" a senior official from packaged food major ITC Ltd said.

After a year long protest by farmers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday the repeal will be completed in the winter session of Parliament.

The three laws gave farmers the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country, sought to destroy the monopoly of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees, and provide a legal framework for contract farming among other things. The government also proposed to scrap its powers to impose stockholding limit on food items, except under extraordinary circumstances.

With small and marginal farmers comprising over 80 percent of the agricultural class, cultivators felt the contract farming model would be skewed to favour large companies. They also felt this signalled the end of the minimum support price (MSP) system of procurement by the government, the largest buyer of farm produce.

Not everyone agreed with the ITC officer’s assessment though. Officials from sugar companies such as Shree Renuka Sugar Ltd and Bajaj Hindustan Sugar Ltd said that the repeal of the three farm laws is a backward step when trying to move towards a market-driven agriculture economy.

They added that logistical bottlenecks in procurement of raw materials, which the farm laws were going to address, will remain and raw material costs will remain high due to lack of market driven rates.

""Sugarcane procurement rates will once again be determined by central government set prices rather than a market-driven scenario, which was proposed under the now-repealed farm laws,"" an official said on condition of anonymity.

Others were optimistic of structural reforms emerging from the new committee that has been announced.

""The decision to form a committee to address farm issues would go a long way to identify the actual pain points of the farmers and help the government to make adequate farm policy to enhance the income level of the farmers,"" Pradeep Multani, President, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI).

This would particularly help marginal farmers who comprise 80 percent of total farmers and hold less than 2 hectare of land, he stressed. PHDCCI is the largest industry association in the northern states of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.

Farmer organisations also said the move would change little on ground.

""We have to see what happens going forward. But what I believe is that the unions and protestors should suspend the agitation and give the government time to deliver,"" said Ajay Vir Jakhar, agri policy expert and former Chairman of the Punjab State Farmers' & Farm Workers' Commission.

Jakhar has been longtime Chairman of Bharat Krishak Samaj (Indian Farmers Forum) and said that in case the farmers are not happy, they can return to Delhi before the 2024 national elections.

However, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Friday said it will wait for the announcement to take effect through due parliamentary procedures before declaring victory.

""If this happens, it will be a historic victory of the one year long farmers' struggle in India. However, nearly 700 farmers have been martyred in this struggle. The central government's obstinacy is responsible for these avoidable deaths, including the murders at Lakhimpur Kheri,"" it stressed.

Saying that further decisions will be announced soon, the SKM said the farm agitation was not just for the repeal of the three laws, but also for a statutory guarantee of remunerative prices for all agricultural produce and for all farmers."

The company is likely to appoint bankers to explore demerger options of its IT business.

The technology services and solutions provider is likely to be valued at Rs 20,000-25,000 crore, sources told CNBC TV18.

ITC Infotech provides technology solutions and services to enterprises across industries such as banking and financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, consumer goods, and travel and hospitality, through a combination of traditional and newer business models, as a long-term sustainable partner.

The wholly owned subsidiary of ITC also recently announced a collaboration with Harvard Business School to develop a productivity framework with Prithwiraj Choudhury, Lumry Family Associate Professor at Harvard Business School.

The Work from Anywhere (I-WFA) framework will allow the company’s employees living away from its base centres due to the pandemic, to work from smaller centres that the company will set up at ITC properties across the country.

"November 04, 2021 02:11 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/value-stocks-the-low-risk-way-to-grow-your-wealth-7678261.html,"The Indian stock market staged an outstanding performance since last Diwali, primarily on the hopes of faster recovery from the adverse impact of the pandemic. Of course, ample liquidity also helped matters.

The upshot: stocks are richly valued across the board. For conservative investors for whom capital protection is a priority, buying value stocks makes tremendous sense. Value investing is about buying stocks that are trading at prices lower than the company’s worth fundamentally.

Of course, what goes into that valuation could be divergent but largely the idea is not to pay excessively for growth expectations. This Diwali, we have picked up the following four value stocks for you.

ITC

In a market where valuations are elevated, it’s a rarity to find a bluechip stock available cheap. But tobacco major ITC fits into this bracket. The stock has been undervalued for sometime, testing the patience of investors waiting for the value to unlock. That has not happened so far because not only tobacco as a business is loathed by global investors for the health hazard that comes with it, markets also fear declining tobacco sales as a threat to growth.

The government’s move to continuously raise taxes will depress volume growth in the business that delivers around 85 percent of profits (earnings before interest and tax) for ITC. But then, cash flows are for real and stock market probably can’t ignore that for long, especially in a market where stocks offering stable growth are overpriced.

“ITC offers an attractive 5 percent FY23 dividend yield and we expect double-digit earnings CAGR over FY22-24,” wrote Kunal Vora of BNP Paribas Securities India Pvt Ltd in a report on October 28. CAGR refers to compound annual growth rate.

ITC cigarettes business is seeing a good recovery after the second COVID wave. ITC has said cigarette volumes saw smart recovery during the September quarter (Q2FY22) with volumes towards the end of the quarter at near pre-pandemic levels. This sets the stage for better recovery from Q3 unless a third wave hits the country. As the economy normalises, ITC’s other businesses too are expected to see a decent bounce back. At some point, a spin-off of the various businesses may unlock value embedded in the different businesses.

NTPC

If banks are a proxy for the economy, power is the proxy for the manufacturing sector. In fact, it is a proxy for the economy, too. NTPC Ltd in that sense is really a play on the economy, except that being a utility, its returns are capped. NTPC has been going cheap, again because the market is enamoured by renewables and unenthused by thermal energy, which is NTPC’s mainstay now. But NTPC actually offers the best of both worlds.

“While the high concentration of coal-thermal projects had raised ESG (environment, social and governance) concerns on the company, we see incremental efforts toward RE expansion,” said analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a report on October 31. The brokerage further added, “This, along with an improvement in the RoE (return on equity) profile, should lead to a re-rating in the stock.”

NTPC’s ambitious RE expansion is expected to assuage ESG concerns. NTPC plans to have around 15GW RE capacity by financial year 2024 (FY24) and another 45GW capacity by FY32. As such, NTPC’s low cost of funding is a distinct advantage for its RE expansion.

“Potential monetisation of its RE and power trading subsidiaries could further improve shareholders’ returns in the coming years,” said a recent report from Sharekhan Ltd.

NTPC’s shares have appreciated by around 38 percent so far this calendar year, reflecting the bright outlook to some extent. But it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 8 times for FY23 estimates based on average estimates of a few brokerages and its price-to-book ratio stands at 0.9 times. That’s cheap.

NMDC

The NMDC Ltd shares have underperformed the broader markets in the past six months. To that extent, valuations of the iron ore producer are cheap. NMDC is a play on strong iron ore prices and volumes. It plans to raise its production meaningfully over the coming years. According to its FY21 annual report, the company plans to reach the capacity of 67 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) by 2025. In FY21, production stood at 34.1 mtpa.

NMDC is primarily an iron ore producer but it is also a rare earth elements play. In 2018, NMDC signed an MOU with Indian Rare Earths Ltd, which proposes to explore opportunities in rare earths in India and abroad. This could provide some option value in the stock. Indian billionaire investor Radhakishan Damani is amongst top 25 shareholders of NMDC. In its Q4FY21 investors presentation, NMDC informed Damani owned 34 lakh shares of the company or 0.12 percent equity. According to NMDC’s Q1FY22 presentation, as on July 31, Damani owned around 54 lakh shares or 0.19 percent holding.

Further, investors should watch the progress on the commissioning of the 3 mtpa steel plant at Nagarnar, Chhattisgarh. Analysts believe the demerger of the steel plant would create value for shareholders.

For the September quarter (Q2FY22), NMDC is expected to report strong set of numbers year-on-year on the back of healthy realisations and higher sales volume. NMDC has said, “With a 56% increase in production and a 37% increase in sales over CPLY (corresponding period last year), the Navratna PSE surpassed its previous best Q2 performance.”

Container Corp of India

Container Corp of India Ltd (Concor), trading about 10 percent away from their 52-week highs of Rs 754.40, has a solid presence in the logistics sector. For now, Concor expects volumes to get a boost from the partial commissioning of the DFC (dedicated freight corridor).

Further, pleased with the growth momentum seen in the half year ending September, Concor’s management has revised its FY22 guidance for revenue to 15 percent (from 12 percent earlier). The company now expects its profit after tax to more than double year-on-year for FY22.

Going ahead, the full commissioning of the DFC is positive from volume perspective. “The DFC potential has started unlocking and the much-awaited divestment (potentially in FY23) could be the trigger that further re-rates the stock,” said analysts from Edelweiss Securities Ltd. “We expect significant earnings growth in FY23-25E and hence expect the upside to materialise.”

This state-owned company is a candidate for disinvestment. Thus, needless to say, investors would do well to monitor news flow on the divestment, going ahead. Further, investors should also keep a close eye on land policy by the government for long-term leasing.

“Land policy finalisation is awaited (Cabinet approval awaited) which will allow the company to pay upfront for 30 years LLF and lock in the present rates,” said ICICI Securities’ analysts. Based on the average FY23 estimates of a few brokerages, the Concor stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 30 times."

Bears took full control over Dalal Street on October 28 with all sectoral indices caught in their trap, driving the benchmarks down nearly 2 percent. It was the biggest single-day fall since April 2021, as global brokerage house Morgan Stanley downgraded Indian equities to equal-weight from overweight due to expensive valuations.

The BSE Sensex fell below the psychological 60,000 mark, down 1,158.63 points, to close at 59,984.70. The Nifty50 also closed well below the crucial 18,000 milestone, falling 353.70 points, to close at 17,857.30.

Bank Nifty, metal and realty were prominent losers with more than 3 percent correction. Pharma and FMCG indices corrected around 2 percent each.

Stocks that were in focus included United Spirits, which was one of the outperformers in the broader space, hitting a record high of Rs 944.75 before closing with 1 percent gain at Rs 892.55. IndusInd Bank was the biggest gainer in the BSE Sensex as it touched a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,242 before closing with 2.93 percent gains at Rs 1,176 after September quarter earnings.

ITC seems to have reacted negatively to its September quarter earnings, falling 5.6 percent to close at Rs 225.10. It was the biggest loser in the BSE Sensex.

Here's what Shrikant Chouhan of Kotak Securities, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

ITC

The stock witnessed a sharp price correction from Rs 265 resistance level. On the daily and intraday time frames, it has formed lower high and lower low formation which is broadly negative for the ITC.

However, the medium-term structure is still on the positive side. Over 15 percent price correction from the monthly highest level, currently the stock is trading near 50-day SMA (simple moving average).

We are of the view that, 50-day SMA and Rs 219 would act as a key support level for the positional traders. A sharp pullback rally up to Rs 240-245 is not ruled out if it succeeds to trade above Rs 219.

IndusInd Bank

On Thursday, the stock opened with a gap and made a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,242. But one more time it took the resistance near Rs 1,240 and corrected sharply.

The stock sees non-directional activity now. Traders are waiting for the either side breakout. For the bulls, Rs 1,220-1,240 would be the important breakout level to watch.

And if, the stock manages to close above the same, we can expect quick uptrend rally towards Rs 1,270-1,300. On the flip side, trading below Rs 1,140 may increase further weakness up to Rs 1,100-1,070.

United Spirits

In this week so far, the stock rallied over 8 percent. After a yesterday sharp reversal move, on Thursday, the stock opened with a gap up and registered a fresh all-time high of Rs 944.75.

On the weekly charts, the stock has formed strong bar reversal bullish candle along with strong modest volume. Further, on daily charts, it has formed higher bottom series pattern which also support further uptrend from current levels.

For the positional traders, Rs 850-830 would be the key level to watch. If it manages to trade above the same then we can expect uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 1,000.

Some of the costs savings achieved during pandemic may sustain and coupled with high operating leverage may lead to higher than pre-covid margins from Q3FY22E.

Emkay Global Financial's report on ITC

Q2 performance was slightly ahead of estimates, with PAT growth of 14%. Cigarette sales/EBIT grew 10% yoy, recovering to 95% of pre-Covid levels. FMCG grew 3% yoy on high comparables (2-year CAGR 11%) and maintained 10% EBITDA margins. Cigarette recovery appears healthy with exit volumes at near pre-Covid. A further increase in mobility and ITC’s initiatives on portfolio expansion should drive a healthy recovery. However, a stable taxation policy remains key to sustaining steady growth ahead. FMCG sequential trends indicate a likely pick-up in growth in H2 as the base normalizes. Increasing cost pressure may, however, limit margin gains in the immediate term. Other divisions (Hotels/Agri/Paper) saw strong growth (EBIT up 63%), led by Paper/Hotels.

Outlook

ITC’s IT business has seen strong rise in its profitability (PAT up 70% in H1) and we now value it at Rs12/share. We maintain Buy and arrive at a fair value of Rs270, based on a two-stage DCF growth model with a derived target PE multiple of 17.6x (Dec’23E EPS).

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after its September quarter earnings:

Jefferies

The brokerage house has kept the ‘buy’ call with a target at Rs 300 per share.

The cigarette volumes were a bit lower which was offset by better margin, while exit volumes are close to pre-COVID level, which is a positive.

The FMCG wing has slowed down, partially due to the base issue, while paperboard continued to see strong on-year growth. However, budget is a key event, given an expert panel deciding on tobacco taxation.

Morgan Stanley

The research firm has retained ‘overweight’ with a target at Rs 251 per share as earnings were marginally ahead of the estimates.

The cigarettes business topline was weaker than expected and in FMCG business, the topline growth is well below the expectations.

Prabhudas Lilladher

ITC is focusing on innovations and distribution expansion across FMCG and cigarettes which should bode well in the coming years.

The near-term outlook seems mixed with improved outlook in cigarettes, strong growth and margin outlook in paperboard, rising occupancy and EBIDTA positive in hotels and steady leaf tobacco prices and benefits of currency depreciation.

It maintained ‘buy’ with an SOTP-based target price of Rs 270.

Sharekhan

Strong earnings visibility with improving growth prospects of the core cigarettes business, margin expansion in the non-cigarette FMCG business, and high cash-generation ability with strong dividend payout will reduce the valuation gap in the coming years, it said.

The brokerage maintained ‘buy’ recommendation on the stock with an unchanged price target of Rs 280.

At 9:17am, ITC was quoting at Rs 234.75, down Rs 3.65, or 1.53 percent on the BSE.

A seven-session rally, the market faced a drag from ITC off its record peak on Tuesday. It was perhaps the news of health ministry reviewing the taxation structure for tobacco products that had pulled the share down 6 percent. On October 20, ITC was trading 1 percent down.

The cigarettes business, which accounted for more than 40 percent to the total revenue for ITC, has seen a major relief at least since the Covid period as the government has not majorly tweaked any tax with respect to the tobacco segment.

A revival in consumption demand took the stock up 26 percent in more than a month, making it one of the major contributors to the market rally.

The Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare has set up an expert panel to review the taxation policy for tobacco products. The panel will develop a proposal for comprehensive tax policy for tobacco products with a public health perspective, the health ministry said on October 19.

Any increase in tax on tobacco-related products erodes the margins for ITC, but the company has always passed on the cost to consumers by hiking products prices. ""The demand is inelastic and does not change much due to increase in price as smokers are addicted to it. There can be a knee-jerk reaction but prices move up soon,"" said Jay Prakash Gupta, Founder at Dhan.

Likhita Chepa, Senior Research Analyst at CapitalVia Global Research feels the proposed tax structure on tobacco products is expected to put a strain on the margins of the company as cigarettes form a significant chunk of the total business of the conglomerate.

The inflationary pressure, reflected in Hindustan Unilever's operating margin for the September quarter, was also one of the reasons for the correction in ITC, though experts feel the consumption demand is getting improved. HUL was also down over 4 percent in the previous session.

""Most of the FMCG counters are continuously facing the heat of unprecedented input cost inflation and subdued consumer sentiment in the short term. A sell-off in broader markets has halted the stocks' rally and it could be profit-booking,"" said Ankur Saraswat, Research Analyst at Trustline Securities.

Apart from tobacco business, ITC also operates in several other businesses such as FMCG, hotels, paperboards and speciality papers, packaging, agri products and IT.

""ITC's business verticals are diverse and each of the verticals have potential to create enormous wealth and value for shareholders,"" said Jay Prakash Gupta.

He further said ITC as a stock has underperformed over the years. The stock is not overpriced given the kind of cash flow it generates. ""ITC must spin off its businesses and if that is done it would create a lot of value for shareholders.""

Ankur Saraswat feels the stock is available at very attractive valuations. ""With rapid vaccination drive leading to reopening of economy and gradual recovery in consumers demand in urban and rural areas, revival of its education and stationary products business, expected revival in hotels business, focusing on cost-saving programmes with richer business and category mix,"" he explained.

The net profit margin of the company for FY21 has come down to 28.65 percent from previous year's 33.17 percent but the revenue from the operations have been growing YoY. ""Therefore, investors can add this stock to their portfolio after a healthy correction,"" said Chepa of CapitalVia Global Research.

Experts expect its net profit and sales to improve going ahead, though there could be a bit of strain on margin (in cigarette business) if there is a change in tax structure.

ITC will release its second-quarter earnings on October 27. ""ITC is expected to see a swift recovery in cigarette volumes and other discretionary business with normalisation of our out-of-home activity. Consolidated revenues are likely to grow at 13.4 percent with an expected 9.4 percent growth in cigarettes sales,"" said ICICI Direct.

The brokerage expects cigarettes volumes growth of 7 percent. The hotels business is estimated to double over its low-base quarter and the FMCG and paper division is likely to grow 13.4 percent and 12.2 percent, respectively. ""We estimate the agri business growth at 6.5 percent on a relatively high base. We estimated 118-bps improvement in operating margins at 35.1 percent and the net profit is likely to grow 12 percent."""

This week, the Nifty has given a strong breakout and sustained above the 18,000 mark which shows strong positive market sentiment for the medium term. The price action maintained its higher top-higher bottom formation on all the timeframes like daily, weekly and monthly charts, signalling the possibility of a continuation of the uptrend in coming days.

However, the momentum indicator RSI or relative strength index is forming a series of negative divergence on daily as well as on weekly charts, indicating some caution at higher levels.

Looking at the chart, we believe the index is currently moving in a strong uptrend. We can expect the index to move higher towards 18,382 (38.2 percent extension level of 15,513 – 17,947 projected from 17,452) followed by 18,670 (50 percent extension level of 15,513 – 17,947 projected from 17,452) and eventually towards 18,957 (61.8 percent extension level of 15,513 – 17,947 projected from 17,452).

The stop loss level for the Nifty would be the 18,000 mark on closing basis.

Here are three technical buy calls for next two to three weeks:

ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 256.55 | Stop Loss: Rs 230 | Target: Rs 310 | Return: 21 percent

ITC has given a triangle pattern breakout on the weekly charts with volume confirmation a few weeks ago that shows a strong bullish undertone for the stock in the medium to long term.

Looking at the price action, momentum indicators and other technical parameters, we believe this stock has a lot of upside potential left.

Going ahead, we expect the bullish momentum to accelerate if the price goes above the previous swing high of Rs 310. If this level is breached, we might see the stock move towards Rs 322 followed by Rs 367.

The stop loss for this trade setup would be Rs 230 levels on closing basis.

Tata Consumer Products: Buy | LTP: Rs 849.60 | Stop Loss: Rs 796 | Target: Rs 960 | Return: 13 percent

The stock had entered a corrective phase after hitting a lifetime high of Rs 889 and moved lower towards Rs 796, which coincides with the 20-week simple moving average and 23.6 percent retracement level of Rs 458 to Rs 889. For the past three weeks the prices have been finding support near the same and bounced back sharply.

If this level holds, we might see prices gain momentum and move higher toward the recent lifetime highs of Rs 889 and eventually towards Rs 960 (38.2 percent extension level of Rs 458 – Rs 889 projected from Rs 796).

Investors can accumulate Tata Consumer at this point and hold with a target of Rs 889 and Rs 960, and maintain a stop loss of Rs 796 on closing basis.

Federal Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 93.10 | Stop Loss: Rs 85 | Target: Rs 110 | Return: 18 percent

Federal Bank has given a triangle pattern breakout with volume confirmation this week on the weekly charts which indicates strong positive sentiment for the medium to long term.

The momentum and technical indicators all point to the possibility of the prices moving higher towards the Rs 98.55 mark immediately. If level is breached, we might see the prices move towards the Rs 110 level eventually.

The stop loss for this trade setup would be Rs 85 levels on closing basis.

India accounts for only 2.5 per cent of the global agriculture exports, and there is an opportunity to double it in the medium term and improve the economics of the sector, ITC Chairman Sanjiv Puri on said on Thursday.

There is an urgent need to deal with the agriculture value chain, which would help in improving the quality of income in rural areas and ushering in socio-economic transformation in the country, Puri said while virtually addressing an event organised by industry body PHDCCI.

The sector also needs ""immediate and substantive transformation"" because it is also the most threatened by global climate change, he added.

""I think the most important sector that we need to deal with is really the agriculture value chains. And to that I would also add the wood-based value chains as an opportunity,"" Puri said.

""Presently, because of our productivity and limitations on quality, sustainability and limitations of value addition, India merely accounts for only two and a half per cent of the global exports,"" the ITC chairman said.

""The opportunity is very clearly to be able to double it in the medium terms, and doubling this offers the opportunity to actually improve, and improve the economics of this sector,"" he said adding that it needs a lot of policy reforms.

Some has been already undertaken at the centre and states level on agri infrastructure, funds, regulations, the marketing linkages, etc, Puri noted.

""What we have to envision is to move away from a production centric agriculture system to the next generation agriculture, which is demand-responsive,"" he said.

The dependence of the workforce on the agri value chains in India is also immense. Nearly two-thirds of rural livelihoods come from the sector and about half of the workforce of India is engaged in the sector.

""Despite such a large workforce being engaged in agriculture, its share in the GDP is under 20 per cent, reflecting the endemic problems of productivity and low incomes. So, this is really a serious concern in terms of the quality of incomes here,"" he added.

The food processing industry which lies at the intersection of agriculture and active manufacturing is an ""enormous economic multipliers"" and has the best employment to capital ratios, Puri observed.

""It is an industry which creates an enormous amount of post-harvest management livelihood. It also brings efficiencies, and also positively impacts farm incomes,"" Puri said.

According to him, agriculture is a sector threatened by climate change, though it is a small contributor to it.

""We have witnessed the extreme weather events, year on year, and the devastation they have caused on many facets of economic activity, but certainly substantially to agriculture, and experts actually predict that by 2050, if climate change continues unabated in the trajectory that it is progressing today, extreme weather events will multiply 75 times,"" he added.

For example, wheat yields could drop by 50 per cent after climate change, he added.

Moreover, India is already a water stress country, with 54 per cent of the country falls in that.

According to Puri, agriculture is a sector, which has ""immense opportunity"".

By 2050, the world is going to be home to 9 billion people and by 2027, India is going to be the most populous country with 1.5 billion people.

""And by that time, people would have better incomes better consumption, and therefore the world would need an enormous amount of food to manage the requirements and India will be the largest arable land in the world and a leader in many commodities,"" he said adding it will have a ""unique opportunity to partake in the growing requirements and service of the world""."

Bulls are roaring again as the market had a strong run-up with benchmark indices hitting fresh record highs on September 16, extending uptrend for the third consecutive session, which is attributed to the government's announcement for telecom and auto sectors.

The BSE Sensex closed above 59,000 mark and Nifty50 above 17,600 levels for the first time, gaining 418 points and 110 points respectively, outperforming the broader markets which closed with moderate gains.

Among sectors, the Nifty Bank gained the most with 2.22 percent rally as PSU Bank index spiked 5.4 percent and Private Bank rose 2.67 percent, while FMCG and Financial Services rallied over a percent each.

Stocks that were in focus or action included cigarette-hotel-to-FMCG major ITC that rallied 6.83 percent to close at Rs 230.75, private sector lender IndusInd Bank, which rallied 7.34 percent to close at Rs 1,131.25. Also, hypermarket chain Avenue Supermarts shares hit a fresh record high of Rs 4,099 on Thursday, before closing with gains of 2.82 percent at Rs 4,094.35.

Here's what Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities Ltd, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:

ITC

The stock has rallied over 7 percent on September 16. After a strong opening, the stock quickly surpassed Rs 220 medium-term resistance level with strong volume activity. Post breakout it maintained positive momentum throughout the day and succeeded to close above the same which is broadly positive for the ITC.

In the short term time frame, the stock has formed a strong price volume breakout pattern. The texture of the pattern suggests breakout action will continue in the near term if it succeeds to trade above Rs 220 level.

For the swing traders, Rs 220 would be the sacrosanct level, above the same, we can expect an uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 240-247.

IndusInd Bank

On September 16, the stock registered a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,186.50. In this month so far, it rallied over 13 percent, and on daily and weekly charts, the stock has formed a breakout continuation pattern which is grossly positive for IndusInd Bank.

However, on the intraday time frame, momentum indicators indicate the stock is in the overbought zone and high chances of quick short term price correction can not ruled out if stock trading below Rs 1,095.

For the next few trading sessions, Rs 1,095 could be the trend decider level for the bulls. If it sustains above the same, we can expect a continuation of uptrend up to Rs 1,185.

Further uptrend may also continue which could lift the stock to Rs 1,225. On the flip side, dismissal of Rs 1,095 could possibly trigger a quick short term correction to Rs 1,040.

Avenue Supermarts

Post strong uptrend rally from Rs 3,600 to Rs 4,000, the stock was trading in a narrow range. But after a strong opening, bulls again took control and due to sharp incremental volume activity, it successfully clear the resistance of Rs 4,020.

On the weekly charts, the stock has formed a strong bullish candle which is broadly positive. Further, on daily charts, the stock has formed a higher bottom series pattern which suggests a strong bullish structure is likely to continue in the medium term.

For the positional traders, Rs 3,950 should be the key level to watch, if it manages to trade above the same, then we can expect an uptrend continuation wave up to Rs 4,300-4,500.

ITC, a long-undervalued stock, surged as much as 8 percent on September 16 to the highest level in seven months, after a period of consolidation since the beginning of 2021.

The stock climbed to a high of Rs 233.50 on the BSE, the highest since February 9. It had consolidated in a range of Rs 200-225 since February.

The Nifty 50 has gained more than 25 percent and the FMCG index has jumped over 19 percent since the start of the calendar year.

ITC, with interests in segments including fast moving consumer goods, hotels, cigarettes, agri-business and information technology, has added only 3.3 percent in the year ended September 15 and was the lowest gainer among Nifty FMCG stocks. Hindustan Unilever rallied 16 percent, Britannia Industries 14 percent and Dabur 19 percent in the same period.

Attractive valuations, expected improvement in business outlook, lower lockdown impact on the FMCG and cigarette segments, a strong portfolio of FMCG brands, and the potential of value unlocking could be driving the stock, experts said. They advised investors to hold the stock for a couple of years, given the expected returns along with good dividend yield.

“Today is the big payoff day for investors of the meme favourite and laggard stock – ITC,” said Aprajita Saxena, a research analyst at Trustline Securities. “This sudden rally is on the backdrop of expected improvement in business outlook for ITC. The stock was lagging behind in terms of performance. So, from a valuation perspective, this is one of the cheaper consumption-theme stocks in the FMCG space.”

She said that according to information provided by company officials, there’s no ruling out the possibility of ITC restructuring its various businesses, including demerging the hotel division and the listing of ITC Infotech. ITC Hotels has more than 100 hotels in over 70 destinations.

“This would be a value unlocking of hotels and other businesses. It is expected that the spun-off businesses would get a better valuation,” she said.

Atish Matlawala, a senior analyst at SSJ Finance & Securities, said there could be many reasons for the sharp gain in ITC shares – it was one of the very few Nifty stocks that hadn’t participated in the rally, is attractively valued, and has a very good dividend yield of more than 5 percent.

“ITC shares have been long undervalued in the market and it has not participated in the ongoing rally in the market, so the sudden jump in the stock prices was along expected lines,” said Ashis Biswas, head of technical research at CapitalVia Global Research. “The stock has seen a very small rise in prices compared to its peers in the rally.”

What should investors do?

Matlawala said ITC will give good returns over at least three years.

“ITC has built a very strong portfolio of FMCG brands like Aashirvaad atta, Bingo!, Sunfeast, B Natural and Savlon. In the next few years, we believe this will be reflected in the financials,” he said.

Saxena of Trustline said the reduced impact of pandemic-induced restrictions and the faster recovery trend seen in cigarettes are positives, while rising FMCG business profitability will offer an incremental upside potential.

“If ITC is able to break the barrier of Rs 240, then the rally can be expected to continue till the level of Rs 265 in a small period of time,” said Biswas of CapitalVia.

Meanwhile the pay package of Mehta, which stood at Rs 19.42 crore in fiscal 2020, dropped by 21 percent in FY21 to Rs 15.4 crore. Mehta with this pay cut is now the second-most paid FMCG executive in the country, followed by Marico’s Saugata Gupta at Rs 14.02 crore.

Narayanan's salary was 137 times higher than the median salary of Nestle India employees, Mehta’s was 122 times higher than the median salary of HUL employees, while Gupta’s was over 123 times higher, according to the annual reports of these companies.

In FY19, Vivek Gambhir, MD and CEO of Godrej Consumer Products was the highest-paid FMCG executive at Rs 20.09 crore. After Gambhir stepped down from the company in June 2020, Nisaba Godrej, the daughter of Godrej Group chairman Adi Godrej, was appointed the MD and CEO. Godrej waived off her remuneration for the year 2020-21 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company. GCPL appointed Sudhir Sitapati as its MD and CEO in May.

Tata Consumer Products, another FMCG major, paid Rs 10.49 crore in remuneration to its MD and CEO Sunil D’Souza, as compared to Rs 4.3 crore his predecessor Ajoy Misra received in FY20.

The remuneration package includes salary, allowances and perquisites, contribution to retiral funds, long-term incentives, and stock options.

Salaries soar

Mehta also was the only CEO in the segment to witness a drop in his salary during the year. Most other companies gave pay hikes to their top executives. Dabur CEO Mohit Malhotra drew the highest pay hike of 54.61 percent to Rs 10.22 crore.

His remuneration in FY20 stood at Rs 6.61 crore. ITC’s Sanjiv Puri, too, witnessed a significant hike of 47 percent in FY21. His overall salary for the period stood at Rs 11.95 crore as compared to Rs 7.83 crore drawn a year back.

ITC changed the remuneration structure of its key managerial structure in 2019 after its largest shareholder British American Tobacco turned down the proposal to issue stock options to top executives. Puri’s salary for FY20 only accounted for a few months of this change as it was approved by the board in September 2019. The effect of restructuring is reflected in his FY21 salary. Puri’s total pay was 222 times higher than the median salary of ITC employees.

The pay package of Varun Berry, MD and CEO, Britannia, jumped 7.46 percent to Rs 10.52 crore as compared to Rs 9.78 crore in FY20. Saugata Gupta’s remuneration jumped by 2 percent, while Emami MD Sushil K. Goenka’s salary remained unchanged at Rs 1.4 crore. However, given that he is a promoter of the company, Goenka's payout also includes dividends and could be much higher than the figure shared in the annual report.

Navigating the crisis

The handsome payouts by the FMCG companies to their top executives come in a period that has been marred by supply chain challenges and other logistics issues. Much like several other industries, The FMCG companies had a difficult time ensuring sales of their products after the government announced a nationwide lockdown as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic struck the country.

The companies, however, were quick to adopt technology and other innovative measures to resolve these issues and eventually reported recovery towards the end of the year.

“The FMCG industry has performed well in the last two years. Most of the products in the segment are essential in nature and despite the supply disruption during the first wave, the top honchos were able to steer their companies towards recovery,” said James Agarwal, MD of BTI Executive Search.

“Hence, they have been rewarded for handling the crisis,” said Agarwal.

The FMCG industry also was comparatively less impacted by the pandemic as compared to sectors such as hospitality, travel and tourism or media and entertainment.

Nestle India’s revenue from operations for the full year 2020 grew 7.93 percent to Rs 13,350 crore, while its net profit for the period jumped 5.79 percent over the previous year to Rs 2082.43 crore. HUL reported an 18 percent growth in annual turnover to Rs 45,311 crore in FY21, while net profit in this period also rose 18 percent. The gross revenue and profit after tax from ITC’s FMCG business for FY21 stood at over Rs 48,000 crore and Rs. 13,000 crore, respectively."

Hospitality-to-FMCG conglomerate ITC plans to invest $2 billion in the medium term to create growth vectors under its ‘ITC Next’ strategy.

The company plans to invest across its FMCG, hospitality, agriculture, education and stationery businesses, chairman and managing director Sanjiv Puri said at a press conference on August 12.

“We will be investing to expand our capacity, for example, as the sales of a particular category increase, we have to add regional lines. Similarly, we will invest in upgrading technology to remain contemporary. We have also identified new growth areas such as plastic substitutes, a super-app for farmers, and scaling up of food processing. All of these will have their investment plans,” said Puri.

ITC is also looking at inorganic opportunities across businesses for the next leg of growth. In FMCG, the company is scouting for acquisitions in the food and personal care segments, Puri told Moneycontrol.

“We have a wide portfolio in both food and personal care and we are open to looking at opportunities that are aligned to our strategic plan. We are looking at something that helps us address recent consumer trends and has a strategic fit with our existing businesses,” he said.

While addressing the company’s 110th annual general meeting, Puri shared the ‘ITC Next’ strategy and efforts being taken to drive growth in the years ahead. ITC plans to soon launch a super-app for farmers and is scaling up initiatives across the value chain to become a digital-first company.

Eye on HUL’s throne

ITC plans to dethrone Hindustan Unilever as the country’s top FMCG company and is making efforts on all fronts to achieve this goal. The company has identified potential growth areas across segments and plans to tap them by extending current brands such as Sunfeast and Aashirvaad or launching products. It’s also eyeing the inorganic route.

The company wants to tap consumer trends towards healthy eating and convenience foods. It has introduced ITC Master Chef Frozen Snacks in 120-125 towns and cities and initially aims to drive their adoption in these towns.

“Slowly, we will take the category wider but it will not go deeper quickly. We want to build it in markets where its penetration is low and hence there is tremendous headroom for growth,” said Puri.

At the same time, it is extending the Aashirvaad brand to cater to adjacent staples categories.

“Aashirvaad started as an atta (flour) brand and then we ventured into specialised atta. We have also launched gluten-free millet mixes, vermicelli and now we plan to launch ready-to-cook chapatis in Kerala under the brand,” he said.

Smart solutions for homes, health, wellness and hygiene, convenience foods, and indulgence foods are some growth areas that the company has identified.

Growing FMCG pie

ITC, of late, has been trying to shake off its image as a cigarette company, which has impacted its market performance. It has been pushing its FMCG business towards this end, which, according to the company, has yielded results.

The company’s FMCG unit garnered consumer spending of over Rs 22,000 crore and reached more than 150 million households in FY21, Puri told shareholders at the AGM on August 11.

According to Puri, the company’s EBITDA margins in its FMCG business in the past four years have improved by 640 basis points, while revenue increased to almost Rs 15,000 crore from about Rs 10,500 crore. In the past year, FMCG revenue recorded an industry-leading growth of about 16 percent on a comparable basis, he said.

The FMCG business’s gross revenue and profit after tax for FY21 stood at over Rs 48,000 crore and Rs 13,000 crore, respectively.

ITC faces several hurdles on its journey to becoming the top FMCG company in the country. Puri, too, acknowledged this.

“It takes a lot of effort, it takes a lot of resources and not just investments in the brand-building but also in research and development, innovation and to get the right kind of talent and distribution. So, it is not an easy business but quite challenging. But we have made progress so far and are the largest incubator of world-class Indian brands and we are optimistic of delivering good performance going ahead too,” he said."

Better-than-expected cigarette sales lit up ITC’s first-quarter earnings for FY22 as the company reported a 37 percent jump in net revenue to Rs 12,217 crore as compared to Rs 8,911 crore reported in the corresponding period last year. Its net profit for the period stood at Rs 3,013.5 crore (standalone) -- a rise of 28.6 percent as opposed to Rs 2,343 crore in Q1FY21.

The growth in topline was largely led by the company’s cigarette, FMCG and paper segments. The second wave of COVID-19 had limited impact on the segments, especially when compared to the first wave, which coincided with the first quarter of FY21.

“Pandemic-led disruptions impacted most consumer companies but weighed heavily on ITC, which reported a sharp earnings decline in FY21. ITC enjoys a low-base benefit but the first-quarter performance has been sharply ahead, led by cigarettes (and paperboards),” brokerage firm Jefferies said in a note.

Cigarette sales recover

ITC’s revenue from the cigarette segment, its mainstay, jumped 33 percent during Q1FY22 to Rs 5,122 crore in comparison to Rs 3,854 crore a year ago. The company registered a 37 percent jump in earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in Q1FY22 to Rs 3,221 crore.

Cigarette sales contributed 65 percent to ITC’s revenues.

The jump came on a low base as the first quarter of FY21 had witnessed a significant decline in sales due to the onset of COVID-19 and a nationwide lockdown.

“Cigarette EBIT was up 36.7 percent YoY in Q1FY22 on a weak base (38.8 percent decline in Q1FY21). However, it was still 16.2 percent lower than the Q1FY20 levels, and there is little indication of segmental EBIT growth returning to over 10 percent levels anytime soon,” Motilal Oswal Securities said in a note.

The company, however, informed that after severe disruptions in May, there has been week-on-week improvement in market conditions from mid-June, with most markets returning to normalcy and witnessing faster recovery compared to the first wave, consequent to the easing of restrictions, even as certain parts of Kerala, Odisha and the North-East remain partially impacted.

“The pace of volume recovery is better, compared to the previous wave of COVID-19, aided by improved mobility, distribution expansion, and new launches. Also, restrictions were not as severe as previous lockdowns,"" said Mehul Desai, Analyst, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.

ITC introduced several new cigarette variants, such as Gold Flake Excel, Wills Navy Cut Filter and Berkeley Hero, during the quarter, in focus markets. “Gold Flake Premium and Capstan Special 5’s packs were launched in line with evolving consumer preferences,” it said.

This, too, aided growth in the category.

FMCG category remains resilient

The FMCG category, which include several essential products, has helped the company tide over a difficult year. Though ITC registered over a 10 percent growth in FMCG in Q1FY22, it came over a high base of the corresponding period in FY21. Being essential in nature, FMCG had comparatively been less impacted by the first wave. Hoarding by consumers as the government announced lockdowns also led to a sales spike for several FMCG companies in the first quarter of FY22.

Its revenue from the segment stood at Rs 3,726 crore during the quarter as compared to Rs 3,375 crore in the year-ago period (Q1FY21). The FMCG EBITDA grew 16 percent YoY while EBIT was up 38 percent.

“The modest growth has been due to a high base of last year as categories like staple/foods benefited from pantry loading coupled with disruption in the current quarter,” said the note by Jefferies.

ITC had reported a 26 percent decline in net profit in Q1FY21 over Q1FY20, but its revenue from the FMCG segment had grown 10 percent YoY in the quarter as consumers scrambled to stock up essential products.

Despite continued growth in FMCG, ITC continues to draw the highest share of its revenue from cigarettes, a matter of concern for analysts.

“With the cigarettes business likely to contribute over 82 percent to ITC’s overall EBIT even in FY23E (from 85 percent in FY20), there is no material reduction in the dependence on this segment – which is beset by concerns of a) weak EBIT growth for several years now, b) the overhang of a possible GST increase. going forward, and c) ESG-related issues over tobacco, leading to a reduction in valuation multiples,” said Motilal Oswal Securities."

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company post-June quarter earnings:

Citi | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 210

The broking house has kept a neutral call on the stock as operationally there were no major surprises in Q1 results across various segments.

Its revenue & EBITDA grew 37% & 51%, respectively, on a very low base of last year. The lower other income led to a weaker-than-expected profit of Rs 3,010 crore versus estimates of Rs 3,230 crore.

CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 265

CLSA has maintained a buy rating as with a steady expansion in its margin and a reduction in capex, the K-shaped trend will continue.

Also, with expected normalcy, it sees a recovery in ITC’s overall business and margin profile.

The cigarette EBIT margin expanded 210 bps YoY, which was aided by positive operating leverage and holds potential for further expansion. The other FMCG revenue growth was in-line at 10 percent; FMCG margin at 8 percent, expanded 40 bps YoY.

Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 251

Morgan Stanley remains overweight on the stock as revenue and profits were ahead of estimates

The cigarette volumes were up 33 percent YoY ahead of the consensus of 24-28 percent. The earnings beat led by better-than-expected performance in all businesses except FMCG. Its other expenses fell 15 percent QoQ, aided by ITC's cost control initiatives.

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 258

We are marginally decreasing FY22/23 EPS estimates by 2 percent/1.2 percent on account of lower other income which halved during the first quarter. Cigarette volumes recovery has been impacted due to restrictions in Kerala, Odisha and NE and recovery is expected to be slower than expected. FMCG margins have seen benefits of higher scale, rigorous cost control, closer to market production units and rising direct coverage. The trend is expected to continue.

Paperboard has gained margins in inflationary input cost scenario due to backward integration and medium-term outlook remains intact. We expect the hotel business recovery to be delayed due to the second wave, however, traction at leisure locations bodes well for the company.

Agribusiness outlook looks good for the near term as supply chain has been restored and recovery in leaf tobacco exports has improved the sales mix.

Sharekhan | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 265

We have broadly maintained our earnings estimates for FY2022 and FY2023. With easing of lockdown restrictions in most states, cigarette business sales volume are expected to improve in the coming quarters. Management’s enhanced focus and redefined growth strategies have aided the scaling up of the non-cigarette FMCG business margins.

Any sustained scale-up in the margins of the cigarette business, coupled with normalisation in the core cigarette business, would be key triggers for valuation uptick.

ICICI Direct | Rating: Hold | Target: Rs 240

ITC’s share price has underperformed the index with a 16 percent negative return in the last five years (from Rs 250 in July 2016 to 212 in July 2021).

We roll over to FY24 numbers with greater visibility of FMCG business margins and estimate complete recovery in the cigarettes business in FY23-24. We continue to maintain our hold rating on the stock.

ITC said cigarette business registered a 32.9 percent year-on-year growth at Rs 5,122.19 crore and its earnings before interest & tax (EBIT) jumped 36.7 percent to Rs 3,220.94 crore in Q1FY22.

""Strong sequential recovery momentum in cigarettes led to volumes reaching nearly pre-Covid levels in Q4 FY21, and the second wave caused disruptions in convenience store operations during the quarter,"" said ITC.

The company further said certain markets in Kerala, Odisha and North East remained partially impacted.

FMCG-Others segment's revenue grew by 10.4 percent to Rs 3,725.55 crore driven mainly by hygiene products, fragrances, spices, snacks, dairy and agarbattis, and EBIT shot up 38.3 percent to Rs 173 crore in Q1FY22, compared to corresponding period last fiscal.

""In respect of FMCG-Others segment, EBITDA for the quarter ended June 2021 is Rs 298.73 crore, against Rs 257.34 crore in June quarter 2020,"" said ITC.

Hotels business reported a massive 463.5 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 127.24 crore as year-ago quarter impacted the business badly. ITC has narrowed its EBIT loss of hotels business to Rs 151.45 crore from Rs 242.58 crore in the same period.

""After severe disruptions during the quarter, hotels business is rebounding with the easing of restrictions led by leisure destinations, staycations and weekend getaways. Structural cost management actions aid in mitigating impact,"" ITC reasoned.

Agri business segment revenue in Q1FY22 at Rs 4,091.27 crore grew by 9.2 percent driven by wheat, rice and leaf tobacco exports, leveraging strong customer relationships and robust sourcing network, YoY. And its EBIT at Rs 195.74 crore increased by 9.5 percent compared to corresponding period last fiscal.

Paperboards, paper and packaging segment registered a 54.2 percent year-on-year growth in revenue at Rs 1,582.65 crore and 145.3 percent increase in EBIT at Rs 392.83 crore in the quarter ended June 2021.

The growth in paper business was driven by value added paperboards, décor paper and carton packaging, said ITC, adding significant improvement in profitability was driven by richer product mix, higher realisations on the back of surge in global pulp prices and structural cost saving interventions.

ITC said there was strong rebound across operating segments despite operational constraints in the wake of the second wave. Standalone earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) shot up 50.8 percent to Rs 3,992.16 crore compared to year-ago quarter.

Other income during the quarter fell 52.2 percent to Rs 428.99 crore.

ITC shares gained 1.6 percent in the current calendar year 2021, and climbed 6.4 percent in last one year to close at Rs 212.4.

However, the numbers will be healthy on a yearly basis, supported by strong demand in the FMCG segment.

Besides the numbers, the outlook for agri and hotel businesses is expected to be in focus, brokerages said.

The estimates of Kotak Institutional Equities show a 15.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump but a 22.5 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) fall in Q1FY22 net sales.

Adjusted PAT may jump 31.3 percent YoY but fall 17.9 percent QoQ. EBITDA may rise 35.7 percent YoY but 19.7 percent QoQ. EBITDA margin may rise 516 bps YoY and 121 bps QoQ, said Kotak.

Kotak expects a 30.5 percent YoY growth in cigarette volumes, 33 percent YoY growth in cigarette sales (down 12 percent QoQ) led by 2.5 percent price/mix.

""We forecast 35 percent YoY growth in cigarette EBIT. On a 2-year CAGR basis, we build in a 9 percent decline in cigarette EBIT for the quarter,"" said Kotak.

In the FMCG segment, the brokerage firm does not expect any significant acceleration in the health and hygiene portfolio due to the COVID-19 second wave.

""We model 5 percent and 38 percent YoY growth (aided by Sunrise acquisition) in FMCG revenues and EBIT, respectively; we model 130 bps YoY expansion in FMCG EBIT margin to 4.9 percent. We expect hotel

revenues at Rs 140 crore with Rs 120 crore EBIT loss,"" said Kotak.

Edelweiss Securities expects revenues, EBITDA and PAT to grow 41 percent, 68.5 percent and 55.4 percent YoY, respectively.

On the base of -40 percent, cigarette volume growth, we expect cigarette volumes to grow nearly 22 percent YoY, said Edelweiss.

The brokerage firm expects the FMCG business to report nearly 5 percent YoY revenue growth on a base of 10.3 percent.

Hotels business may improve sequentially but continue to be impacted. However, optical growth is high at 800 percent on a soft base of -94.2 percent, Edelweiss said.

""Agribusiness should clock growth of 5 percent YoY a base of 3.7 percent growth. Paper business should see a 30 percent revenue growth on a base of -32.8 percent. We expect 580 bps YoY EBITDA margin expansion as the base quarter was impacted by negative operating leverage,"" Edelweiss said.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects a 28.1 percent YoY growth in net sales while adjusted PAT may rise 41.8 percent. The brokerage firm expects cigarette volume growth of 22 percent.

ITC has 153 employees who received salaries more than Rs 1 crore per annum in FY21.

ITC Private Ltd. added almost 39 employees that received a salary of more than a crore, taking the total of such employees to 153 in the last financial year, as per a report in The Economic Times.

Of the 153 employees, the Fast Moving Goods Consumer Goods (FMCG) business of ITC, which accounts for 65 percent of ITC’s consumer income and over 90 percent of revenue in FY21, has 96 managers earning more than Rs one crore in the last financial year.

The salaries of top FMCG executives have witnessed a mixed trend this year. In comparison to the largest FMCG company in the country, Hindustan Unilever Ltd. has 123 executives that received a salary of more than a crore in FY21 outstripping ITC, the report added.

“Remuneration of key managerial personnel (KMP) increased by 51 percent due to impact of revision in remuneration during the year and increase in the number of KMPs,” the report said.

The severity of the second wave of COVID-19 infections in India poses a key challenge for the FMCG industry and the spread of the virus to rural areas on a relatively higher scale as compared to the first wave is also expected to weigh on industry growth outlook, according to ITC Ltd.

There is heightened uncertainty around the timing and shape of the recovery trajectory of overall economic growth in India due to the virus, the company said in its Annual Report for 2020-21.

In terms of consumption, urban-led recovery may be relatively muted compared to the first wave as consumers switch to precautionary savings mode and rising healthcare costs eat into household spending, while rural demand may also be blunted by the large-scale spread of the virus to the hinterland in the second wave.

""The severity of the second wave of COVID-19 infections in the country poses a key challenge and remains a key monitorable for the FMCG industry in the near-term,” the directors of the company said in the report.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

There is a perceptible shift with consumers adopting a more precautionary savings approach with resources being set aside for medical needs.

""The spread of the virus to rural areas on a relatively higher scale as compared to the first wave, is also expected to weigh on industry growth outlook,” the report added.

Stating that ITC continues to monitor the ""evolving situation”, the company said it ""will respond with agility to enhance its market standing while managing risks associated with the heightened uncertainties in the business environment.”

While the supply chain is fully operational, constraints in the number of operating outlets and limited hours of operation continue to pose front-end challenges for the FMCG industry, it added.

""Recent learnings in dealing with the pandemic spanning sales and distribution, supply chain operations, innovation and product development will continue to be leveraged in this regard,” the company said.

Commenting on the country’s economic growth prospects, the company said while earlier estimates of India’s GDP growth for 2021-22 ranged between 11 percent to 13 percent, ""the ferocity of the second wave in India since February, 2021 has adversely impacted economic prospects”.

""High frequency indicators point to economic activity having fallen by (around) 25-30 percent from nearly pre-COVID levels in February-March 2021. This has led to sharp downward revisions to the earlier growth projections by 200 to 300 basis points,” the company’s annual report said.

Stating that ""there is heightened uncertainty around the timing and shape of the recovery trajectory”, ITC said, ""a rapid scale up in the pace of vaccination and gearing up of the healthcare infrastructure to mitigate the impact of possible future outbreaks would be critical going forward.”

On the consumption side, ITC said, ""urban-led recovery may be relatively muted compared to the first wave as consumers switch to precautionary savings mode and rising healthcare costs eat into household spending.”

The report further said, ""rural demand, which remained strong in FY 2020-21, on the back of robust agricultural output, government support and reverse migration, may also be blunted by the large-scale spread of the virus to the hinterland in the second wave.”

On the other hand, ITC said ""less severe restrictions, a more prepared organised sector and a pick-up in vaccination coverage present some of the key mitigating factors going forward”.

Robust recovery in advanced economies and other emerging markets could provide the much needed tailwind from an external demand perspective, it added.

The company, however, said even as the Indian economy faces multi-dimensional challenges in the short term, ""it remains one of the most dynamic major economies in the world with huge potential”.

""With structural drivers of growth firmly in place, the pace of economic growth is expected to pick up over time,” the report added.

Amid COVID-19 pandemic and slump in the hospitality industry owing to lockdown and travel restrictions, ITC Hotels is optimistic about domestic tourism prospects and planning to increase the number of properties under the brand Welcomhotel.

The Rs 45,000 crore hospitality arm of ITC, said it was planning to increase the number of properties under the brand Welcomhotel to 25 in a year''s time from 19 now.

""ITC Welcomhotel will be a 25 property brand over next 12 months,"" an ITC official told PTI.

The brand opened two properties in a span of six months. Welcomhotel Tavleen Chail was unveiled on Thursday and Welcomhotel Shimla about six months ago. And Welcomhotel Ahmedabad and Welcomhotel Port Blair were relaunched in March quarter.

""Collaborating with like-minded partners who bring unique hospitality experiences has further strengthened ITC Hotels footprint across the length and breadth of the country,"" ITC executive director Nakul Anand said.

The pandemic induced lockdowns had blown hard on the hospitality sector and not all were able to sail through. Hyatt Hotels Corporation has suspended operations at Hyatt Regency hotel in Mumbai, and said the property will remain closed till further notice.

""With no funds forthcoming from Asian Hotels (West) Ltd, the owner of Hyatt Regency Mumbai, to sustain the operations of the hotel, a decision has been taken to temporarily suspend all operations for Hyatt Regency Mumbai,"" the hotel had said.

With the addition of the premier mountain resort at Chail, a managed property of Welcomhotel brand, the brand currently boasts a portfolio of around 19 properties across India, officials said.

ITC said its hotel business segment EBITDA was in March quarter at Rs 25 crore against breakeven in previous quarter and extreme focus on cost reduction and controllable cash fixed costs down 41 per cent in FY21.

Analysts speaking about the future said hotel majors are gearing for the rush with vaccination going on steadily and economy opening up gradually, demand will spurt after the long lull. The railway reservations have already jumped 230 per cent. Airlines also expect a similar spurt in demand.

""Vocal for locals is gaining more ground as people prefer to travel motorable distances post pandemic. Hence, domestic tourism is on the rise.

ITC stock has been a major underperformer since March 2021.

There have been many memes circulating with ITC being labelled as an “immovable asset”. It is interesting to see that so many investors or traders are now stuck in this stock and it is simply testing their patience.

It is best to apply Time Cycles to understand the possible reversal dates and also the probable pattern under formation in the stock.

Below is the chart of ITC with Hurst’s Time Cycles

We can clearly see that the stock is forming classic lows near around 55 days Hurst’s Time cycle and reversing back on upside from there. Since March 2021, majority of the lows are around this cycle dates.

However, the desired momentum is not seen. As of now we can see that the stock is now moving to the second half of the cycle which is usually the sell mode. The chances getting bleak for the stock to rally with each passing day until the next cycle low kicks in which is likely only post 14th July 2021.

This means that there is high probability traders and investors who are stuck in ITC might have to wait for more than a month before some action starts. Also, the overall pattern is also forming the shape of topping Head & Shoulder with neckline near 200 levels. Any breach below it might result into panic among traders and there can be some serious selloff that can then kick in until July 14.

For any momentum to gather on upside we need to see the stock breaking above Rs 220 decisively with strong momentum but with cycle entering into the sell mode it might be tough bet to play with.

In a nutshell, ITC can continue to meander in a range of Rs 220–200 for now and positive traction can be witnessed on this stock post July 14, 2021. Traders or investors should be careful once Rs 200 is taken out as that can kick in real panic across.

The latest fourth quarter and full year results for 2020-21 show some interesting trends. Revenues from the FMCG business (ex-tobacco) grew 16 percent for ITC in 2020-21 compared with a peer group average of 8 -9 percent. The comparative figures stand out even more on a quarter-on-quarter sequential basis over the last four quarters.

In the first quarter of 2020-21, ITC’s FMCG segment revenues grew 19 percent compared with a decline of about 2 percent reported by the peer group.; followed by 15 percent in the second quarter against peer group average of around 8 percent. In the third quarter, ITC’s FMCG business segment grew 11 percent compared with an industry average of around 10 percent.

It is only in the fourth quarter that the industry average growth of 20 percent outperformed ITC’s FMCG business growth of 16 percent. This is mainly because of a low base—peer-group revenues had fallen (-) 7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019-20 compared with ITC’s 5 percent growth in the segment revenues on a comparable basis.

For The Future

ITC 2.0, under new chairman Sanjiv Puri, who completes two years at the helm of the tobacco-to-hotels conglomerate, is turning out to be a story of a major improvement of the FMCG business with a sharper focus on innovation, bold acquisitions, and impactful marketing campaigns.

A disaggregated analysis points towards a strategic tilt towards FMCG in recent years, with consistent improvement in margins - a key concern over the years.

Sample this. Between 2017-18 and 2020-21, earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins in the FMCG segment have improved by 500 basis points. In 2020-21, the EBIDTA margin stood at 9 per cent, up 180 basis points over the previous year.

The company appears to be shedding its traditionalist approach on acquisitions in the FMCG space, which may well hold pointers of what could be coming. ITC appears to be increasingly looking at acquisitions in the FMCG space to accelerate growth. The company’s presentation clearly identifies ‘value accretive M&A’ as one of its strategic pillars to grow the FMCG business.

Acquisitions Are The Way

The company’s quarterly presentation clearly identifies “value-accretive M&A” as one of its strategic pillars to grow the FMCG business.

In May last year, it announced the decision to acquire Kolkata-based spice maker Sunrise Foods Pvt. Ltd (Sunrise), seen as part of a broader strategy to fortify its position in the country’s highly competitive FMCG market.

The acquisition, which was completed in July, involved buying out Sunrise in an all-cash deal of Rs 2,150 crore.

Recent acquisitions such as Savlon and Nimyle have added product strength to ITC’s FMCG business portfolio.

ITC acquired Savlon from Johnson & Johnson in 2015, foraying into the disinfectant and antiseptic products market. Savlon crossed Rs 1,000 crore in consumer spends in 2020-21, from Rs 250 crore in the previous year, making it the largest brand in the company’s personal care products portfolio, overtaking Vivel.

What has driven this performance in the (ex-tobacco) FMCG segment? The company’s quarterly presentation holds some clues. ITC has launched over 120 new products during the year, ‘structural advantages’ of purpose-led brands arising out a ‘distributed manufacturing’ and ‘agile supply chain’, as some of the key drivers of growth.

Cross-segment synergies will be critical to sustain the growth trajectory of the (ex-tobacco) FMCG businesses and also to scale up nascent categories and products such as B Natural juices, Fabelle chocolates amongst others."

People are more conscious about the products they are consuming, especially food, forcing packaged food and beverage companies to re-examine strategies.

The recent developments in the FMCG industry — Nestle acknowledging that about 60 percent of its products are unhealthy and Amul-PETA vegan row— show that the discourse on “health” has gone mainstream in India.

The standoff between Amul and People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) took an ugly turn earlier this week after the milk cooperative’s former vice chairman Valamji Humbal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to ban the non-governmental organisation.

While the recent flashpoint has been an advertisement by Amul, it all started when the country’s largest dairy brand objected to companies labelling plant-based beverages as milk.

At the core is the global discourse on vegan, vegetarian and non-vegetarian lifestyles and which is more eco-friendly. The two sides—the dairy industry and PETA that advocates a plant-based lifestyle —claim their products are healthier.

Watch this space, as the last word has not been said in this battle.

Nestle’s fails health test

FMCG major Nestle in a presentation circulated internally acknowledged that 60 percent of its products do not meet recognised definition of health.

According to a report by the UK-based newspaper The Financial Times, the presentation, which was shared among the company’s top executives earlier this year, said only 37 percent of Nestle’s food and beverages by revenues, excluding products such as pet food and specialised medical nutrition, achieve a rating above 3.5 under Australia’s health star rating system.

After the report came to light, Nestle released a statement saying it was working on a company-wide project to update nutrition and health strategy.

Anand Rathi's research report on ITC

ITC’s Q4FY2021 cigarettes sales volume growth stood at 8% (net sale grew by 7%), in-line with street expectation of 8%-9% growth; EBIDTA margin up by 70 bps y-o-y. Sales volume recovered to pre-COVID level in Q4. Non-cigarette FMCG business revenue grew by ~16% each in Q4FY2021 and FY2021. EBIDTA margin reached ~9% in FY2021 (up by 590 bps over FY2018). With no increase in tax rate on cigarettes, we expect cigarette sales volume to gradually pick up (Q1FY2022 might some hiccup due to lockdown restrictions); FMCG is gaining good traction and will maintain its double-digit revenue growth and OPM expansion in the medium term.

Outlook

The stock is currently trading at attractive valuation of 15.4x its FY2023E EPS. The company paid dividend of Rs. 10.75 per share (dividend yield of 5%). We maintain Buy with a revised PT of Rs. 265.

Motilal Oswal's research report on ITC

While a better than expected performance in the Agri business led to a beat on sales, EBITDA and PBT were in line with our estimates. Volume and sales growth in Cigarettes, sales growth in FMCG - Others, as well as a full year dividend payout were broadly in line with our expectations. Unlike other discretionary categories, which have reported a strong rebound, two-year average growth in Cigarette volumes as well as EBIT declined by ~2% each in 4QFY21.

Outlook

While the impact of lockdowns in 1QFY22 may not be as severe as that in 1QFY21, there will be a further sequential impact compared to 4QFY21. Uncertainly on Cigarette EBIT growth, which has been below 10% for 25 of the last 27 quarters, persists. Maintain Neutral.

We are increasing FY22/23 EPS estimates by 3.7-4.5% given recovery in cigarette volumes, pick up in leaf tobacco and Agri exports and 8.9% FMCG EBIDTA margins in FY21. We believe lockdowns are temporary hiccups and expect smart pickup post 1Q. we believe stable cigarette taxation and FMCG profitability are key positives in near term. We expect Agri profitability to improve given strong surge in commodity prices and revival in leaf tobacco demand (20%+ margins). Hotels business remains under cloud but global trends suggest significant pick up in travel in 2H22. We believe double digit EBIDTA margins in FMCG business by FY22/23 and relative stable cigarette tax regime cap any downside.

ITC share price fell 2 percent in early trade on June 2, a day after the company declared its March quarter earnings.

The company's standalone profit declined to Rs 3,748.4 crore compared to Rs 3,797 crore reported in the year-ago quarter.

Standalone revenue from operations (excluding excise duty) in Q4FY21 grew by 22.6 percent to Rs 13,294.7 crore YoY, while revenue (including excise duty) rose 24 percent YoY to Rs 14,156.96 crore during the quarter.

Here is what brokerages have to say about the stock and the company after the March quarter earnings:

JPMorgan | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 225

The in line Q4 EBITDA was boosted by agri. The cigarette growth was underwhelming, while other FMCG/paper was in line. The dividend payout rose in F21 to 100%, however, valuation at 16x F23e P/E are undemanding.

UBS | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 260

The cigarette volumes recovered to pre-COVID levels in Q4. FMCG (non-cigarette) ramp-up continues.

Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 251

The revenue growth was ahead of our estimate, however, earnings were in line with our expectation & consensus.

CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Cut to Rs 265 from Rs 275

CLSA cut earnings estimates for its cigarette business by 3%. The inflationary setting is likely to influence its near-term margin, while remain confident in the improving margin trajectory for other FMCG business

Goldman Sachs | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 242

The EBIT was a miss on cigarette volumes & FMCG margin. The valuation does not fully reflect the combination of yield & growth potential. The bokerage lowered FY22-24 EPS estimates by 4-7% post result. The cuts were largely driven by lower volume/margin in the tobacco segment.

Sharekhan | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 265

We have fine-tuned our earnings estimates to factor in better-than-expected revenue in the agri business, hotels and non-cigarette FMCG businesses and lower margins due to change in mix.

With no major increase in taxes on cigarettes in Union Budget, we expect cigarette sales volume to normalise in the coming quarters (Q1FY2022 might see an impact of lesser operating hours of stores).

Management’s enhanced focus and redefined growth strategies have aided scaling up of the non-cigarette FMCG business margins. Higher focus is on supply agility and reduction in operating cost in the near term.

Prabhudas Lilladher | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 258

We believe stable cigarette taxation and FMCG profitability are key positives in the near term. We expect agri profitability to improve given the strong surge in commodity prices and a revival in leaf tobacco demand (20%+ margins).

Hotels business remains under the cloud but global trends suggest a significant pick up in travel in H2 2022.

We believe double-digit EBIDTA margins in FMCG business by FY22/23 and a relative stable cigarette tax regime cap any downside.

Motilal Oswal | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 220

With PBT growth over FY20-23E (7.4% CAGR) likely to remain similar vis-à-vis weaker growth in the preceding five years (6.6% CAGR), valuations of 17.5x/15x FY22E/FY23E, although cheap, are fair considering the stated concerns. Dividend yield of 5-6% is expected over the next two years, in line with global Cigarette players.

At 09:18 hrs ITC was quoting at Rs 210.45, down Rs 4.75, or 2.21 percent on the BSE.

The share touched a 52-week high of Rs 239.15 and a 52-week low of Rs 163.40 on 09 February 2021 and 29 October 2020, respectively.

Cigarette-FMCG-to-hotel major ITC is expected to report a moderate decline in profit for March 2021 quarter as there was a lower tax cost in the year-ago period. The company will announce earnings on June 1.

The 10 days of base quarter (Q4FY20) had seen an impact of nationwide lockdown, so some segments like agri & paper business could report double digit growth in Q4FY21, but hotels segment is expected to continue to get impacted by COVID-19.

Analysts largely expect revenue growth in the range of 6-10 percent for the quarter compared to year-ago quarter, with cigarette business registering 6-9 percent volume growth and around 8 percent sales growth YoY, while FMCG segment is expected to continue to report double digit growth for the quarter given the expected continuity in demand for packaged foods business.

ICICI Direct expects revenue growth of 9.9 percent with cigarette business expected to grow 7.5 percent. ""The company had taken a cigarette price hike in February 2020 while base quarter sales were impacted by the lockdown in the last 10 days of March 2020,"" said the brokerage which sees 1.2 percent decline in profit.

""We expect 9 percent YoY growth in cigarette volumes, 14 percent YoY growth in cigarette gross sales with 5 percent price-mix impact. We forecast 10 percent YoY growth in cigarette EBIT,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said.

In case of FMCG portfolio, Kotak expects sequential demand trends to hold, with some moderation in health & hygiene portfolio and recovery in discretionary segment. ""We model 15.2 percent and 70 percent YoY growth in FMCG revenue and EBIT respectively. We model 220 bps YoY expansion in FMCG EBIT margin,"" said the brokerage.

FMCG major ITC has rolled out several employee benefits programmes to lend a helping hand to its employees and their families, who have turned COVID-positive.

The company on Thursday announced that it will bear the medical expenses of employees who have been infected by the novel disease.

“To support employees during these difficult times, apart from the full coverage of medical expenses of employees and immediate family members, ITC has also extended a loan facility to employees to support medical treatment of certain family members owing to COVID-19 infection, who are otherwise not covered under the company's medical policy,” said Amitav Mukherji, Head, Corporate Human Resources, ITC Limited.

Mukherji informed medical Insurance coverage has also been extended to the company’s supply chain partners.

ITC has also undertaken several other initiatives to help out its employees' tide over this difficult period. It has introduced a suite of measures such as dedicated covid care centres, helplines managed by the company's HR personnel for emergency support such as testing, provision of oxygen concentrators, hospitalisation, and dedicated camps for vaccination of employees, family members, service providers, and supply chain partners, he added.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

The company is also offering paid leaves to its employees who have been infected or are quarantined as a result of being primary contacts.

Employee Wellbeing programme comprising of counselling services from expert agencies, medical advice and guidance from the company's medical officers, nutrition, and other mental health interventions are some of the other efforts undertaken by the company.

“In every way possible, the intent is to bring to bear the institutional support of the company and the fellowship of colleagues to help employees and families overcome the challenges of the pandemic,” said Mukherji.

ITC with this recent announcement joins a host of other companies such as Borosil, TVS Motor Company, Bajaj Auto, Sun Pharma that have rolled out employee benefits programmes for their employees. Borosil, the first company to announce such an initiative, had said in May that in the event of an employee losing life due to COVID-19, the company would keep paying the salary to the family for the next two years. The company said it would also take care of the education of children till their graduation."

India is going through an unprecedented shortage of oxygen, with several hospitals across the country running short of life-saving gas. With the number of COVID-19 patients rising, this demand is expected to rise. Moloy Banerjee, head of gases - South Asia of Linde Plc, one of the largest industrial gas companies in the world and a major supplier of oxygen in India, believes that distribution remains the bigger challenge for producers across the country. He added that the current production in the country is enough to meet the demand.

Linde – through its affiliates Linde India and Praxair India – is in the process of ramping up production in India. Linde has a combined capacity of more than 2000 metric tonnes per day (MTPD), while India’s overall production is around 9,000 MTPD now.

Edited Excerpts

Q. India is facing an unprecedented oxygen crisis. What is Linde India’s contribution to tide over the situation?

A: Linde India Limited and Praxair India Pvt. Ltd. are subsidiaries of Linde Plc. and collectively, are one the leading suppliers of medical oxygen. In addition to optimizing our operations to maximize output and diverting our industrial redirect supplies of oxygen from most industries to healthcare services, we are working on several large-scale initiatives in cooperation with the Government of India, relevant authorities, and industry partners at a national level to address the current crisis.

Our main focus is currently on increasing supply and improving distribution efficiency, and thankfully many such measures are already in place. For example, Linde is working with various partners to urgently import cryogenic ISO containers from different international locations to India. We are also converting liquid argon and liquid nitrogen tankers to liquid oxygen instead, as well as building new/augmenting existing capacities installations at various partner hospitals. Our teams are working round the clock to ensure that delivery is not interrupted.

Q. Is the availability of oxygen or supply-side bottleneck the real issue behind the current oxygen shortage in India?

A: The rise in oxygen demand is much higher compared to last year. However, the current demand can be met with the volume manufactured collectively in India. But this volume is not available uniformly across the country and the demand is higher in certain parts of India compared to others. Hence, distribution remains the bigger challenge to solve to address the issue of oxygen shortage. As discussed in the third quarter, distribution bottleneck is currently the primary challenge.

Linde India and Praxair India collectively manage and operate several plants with Air Separation and manufacturing capabilities. These plants currently have a combined capacity of more than 2,000 metric tonnes per day (MTPD) and are located across India.

Q. You tied up with Tata Group and ITC to make cryogenic tanks available across the country. What is your strategy in this regard?

A: Linde India is already in the process of importing Cryogenic containers available from SE Asia & the Middle East. We are also exploring other geographies for the availability of cryogenic containers.

Linde is collaborating with various Indian industry partners to transport ISO cryogenic tankers from across the region to India. These containers can carry up to 20 tons of Liquid Oxygen over long distances, and upon arrival, the containers will be conditioned and certified for liquid medical oxygen transport from Linde facilities. The tankers can also act as interim oxygen storages in remote areas that are facing oxygen scarcity.

Q. Are you looking at further tie-ups to ensure the availability of such tankers?

A: The company is currently having discussions with other stakeholders and industry partners so that more containers and necessary equipment can be brought into the country.

All collaborations that lead to productive solutions to combat this pandemic is much needed and welcome now – we are having discussions with various stakeholders and industry partners for possible partnerships in providing greater support to the nation

Q. How effective is the role being played by EG II in terms of coming out of this crisis?

A: As part of Empowered Group 2 (EG2), we are closely working with the Government of India to produce and supply medical oxygen to various parts of the country. All possible efforts are being undertaken to address supply and transportation challenges and we are thankful to our international counterparts and industry partners for providing the necessary support."

As the devastating second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps across India, leading FMCG companies are witnessing a strong surge in demand for their health and hygiene products, including hand sanitiser, hand wash, disinfectant spray and germ protection wipes. Companies such as ITC, Himalaya Drug Company and Patanjali said they have ramped up their production capacity to address spurt in demand, assuring that their hygiene products are available to the consumers.

The companies had witnessed a slowdown in the consumption pattern of these items in the past 2-3 months. Now, they have reviewed their production plans as per the current situation and are rapidly scaling up and have streamlined their production capacities. ""We are witnessing a strong uptick in demand for our hygiene portfolio across some geographies. The robustness and agility of our supply chains provide the flexibility and enable us to address the emerging demand trends,"" ITC Divisional Chief Executive (Personal Care Products) Sameer Satpathy told PTI.

Similarly, Himalaya Drug Company Business Director (Consumer Products Division) Rajesh Krishnamurthy said, ""We have shored up our logistics, sales priorities and capabilities to cater to the COVID-19-induced business environment."" At Himalaya, he said ""production planning is done almost two months in advance hence we didn't anticipate a surge in cases during late March and early April. We have accordingly reviewed the production plans as per current situation"".

Krishnamurthy further said, ""We will continue to ensure that product categories like hand wash, hygiene category, home care and sanitisers are made available to the consumers.""

A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

""We are gearing up and soon everywhere these products will be available,"" Patanjali spokesperson S K Tijarawala said. The second wave is so spontaneous that none thought of such massive and mass spread with speed, he added.

""We have focused and streamlined all our production capacities to cater the demand of cononil, Shwasari Vati, Anu Tel, Giloy Ghan Vati, Tulsi Ghanvati, Chavyanprash and Immunogrit, etc, immunity booster, sanitisers, handwash and medications,"" Tijarawala added. Edelweiss Financial Services Executive Vice-President Abneesh Roy said that due to the second wave of the pandemic, the home hygiene category will witness enhanced demand.

""Hygiene products will see a positive filip. Products like soaps, masks, surface cleaning predicts, sanitisers and possibly mosquito repellants will see a rebound,"" he said. According to him, companies such as HUL, Godrej Consumer Product Ltd and ITC will benefit from this.

However, he also added that although products like hand sanitisers are coming back but are likely to be short-lived due to the shift towards the use of soaps/hand wash. ""In the first four months of 2019-20, sanitisers saw a mad rush with even liquor, paint and many non-FMCG companies launching the product.

""However, in the next two quarters, demand for sanitisers plunged which led to most new entrants exiting the category. Sanitisers are making a comeback due to rising covid cases,"" he said. The segment will consolidate in favour of companies like Reckitt and HUL, which have a much stronger brand equity in this space, he added."

Indices were all red last week as weak global cues, rising bond yields, and fears of COVID-19-led lockdown came to haunt the bulls on Dalal Street. The Nifty formed an opening body bearish Marubozu candlestick pattern and it filled the bullish gap standing around the 14,350-mark on March 19.

India VIX was down almost 10 percent and settled around 20 levels. Though falling volatility index with falling prices of the Nifty is creating doubt in the mind about the sustainability of the current bearish sentiment, the short-term bias will remain bearish till the index continues to trade below the crucial 20-day moving average (DMA) standing at around 14,900.

As momentum oscillators and indicators, specifically RSI & Stochastic, are trading in oversold zones, a relief rally towards 14,900 cannot be ruled out.

An early sign of trend reversal will come on a daily close above 14,900, till then, the Nifty will continue trading lower. Any decisive trading above 15,050 will conclude the current correction leg and the new up wave will start.

Bank Nifty

The Bank Nifty also gave a bearish price action the entire week and closed below its 50-DMA standing at around 34,200. As long as the banking index continues to form lower-high and lower-low formations, the possibility of touching the line of polarity placed around 32,800 is high.

Here is a list of three stocks that can return 13-20 percent in the short term:

Tata Motors: Buy around Rs 300 | Target: Rs 360 | Stop Loss: Rs 270 | Upside: 20 percent

The scrip spurted from a low of Rs 290 and formed a Hammer reversal candlestick pattern on the daily chart, indicating stability in the upcoming sessions. The emerging line of polarity on the daily time frame of the chart suggests bullish momentum in the scrip. Indicators and oscillators are also showing a conducive scenario for the coming sessions. One can go long in the scrip around Rs 300 for the target of Rs 350 and Rs 380 levels with a stop loss of Rs 270.

ITC: Buy around Rs 222 | Target: Rs 260 | Stop Loss: Rs 205 | Upside: 17 percent

This stock is trading above its crucial resistance of Rs 216 and is ready to move to higher levels. At the same time, it has given a break out of rectangle pattern and the stock can touch Rs 260 to achieve its targets. At the same time, prices have given trend line breakout on the upside with the expansion of bands on the daily chart suggests a continuation of the trend in the direction of the breakout. The stock has been in a steady uptrend with higher trough and crests as well. Traders can accumulate this stock for higher levels at around Rs 222 with stop loss of Rs 205 for a target of Rs 260.

Bharti Airtel: Buy around Rs 530 | Target: Rs 600 | Stop Loss: Rs 490 | Upside: 13 percent

The counter is bottoming out with a bullish reversal formation and above Rs 530 level, it is likely to rally towards Rs 600. The stock is trading above its 100 and 200-day moving averages where a previous breakout point of Rs 530 will act as strong support. Momentum indicators are positively poised on both daily and weekly charts, hence we recommend buying the stock around Rs 530 with a target of Rs 600 with a stop loss at Rs 490 on a closing basis.

ICICI Direct's research report on ITC

Recommendation

Buy ITC in range of Rs 204-208 Target: Rs 238 Stop Loss: Rs 186 Time frame: Three months.

Derivatives & Quantitative Outlook

Headline index has registered its life-time highs in February month amid buying among banking heavyweights. Despite the underperformance from the FMCG and pharma space, stocks from technology, BFSI and metal were major drivers of the index move. In the ongoing consolidation, We believe stock like ITC could be the next major mover of Nifty and is likely to retest its Feb highs once again in the coming weeks. ITC has shown a tendency of moving along in line with the open interest addition. The open interest in the stock has increased sharply in the last couple of sessions suggesting ongoing accumulation in the stock. Despite recent profit booking in the stock, the open interest has remained almost intact suggesting prevailing long bias still exists.

ITC plans to expand its offerings in categories such as chocolates and staples, after a foray into cakes and milkshakes, as it tries to boost its food portfolio.

ITC is expected to launch packs of chocolates priced in the range of Rs 5 to 10, under the Fantastik brand, according to a BloombergQuint report. For this offering, it has already installed chillers in shops in North India.

The consumer goods major might also launch rice and pulses under its Aashirvaad brand, a source told the business news website. ITC already sells salt, atta and ghee under the Aashirvaad brand.

ITC's new products will be available in a month. Through the product launches, the company is working towards generating Rs 100,000-crore revenue from its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business, the report said.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

ITC did not respond when contacted by Bloomberg Quint.

ITC has already launched three variants of cakes under the Sunfeast Caker brand at Rs 10 a pack, and three flavours of Sunfeast Wonderz Milk priced at around Rs 25-35.

The products help ITC compete with Britannia in the cakes and biscuits segments, and with Amul in the milkshakes category."

Geojit's research report on ITC

ITC limited is a diversified conglomerate with presence in FMCG, Hotels, Paperboards & Specialty Papers, Packaging, and Agri-business. The company directly employs over 36,500 people across businesses. Q3FY21 standalone revenue up 4.9% YoY (+5.0% QoQ) led by growth in FMCG and Agri businesses. EBITDA margins improved further sequentially to 34.3% (vs. 34.1% in Q2FY21). PAT grew 13.3% QoQ to Rs. 3,663cr. Company declared interim dividend of Rs.5/share during the quarter. We see decent uptick in growth across all of ITC’s segments over the coming quarters. Though GoI’s draft bill on sales of loose cigarettes may have some impact on its cigarette business in the near term, ITC’s diversified portfolio is expected to deliver strong growth over the longer term.



Outlook

Hence, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a rolled forward target price of Rs. 265 based on SOTP.

HDFC Securities' research report on ITC

ITC’s 3QFY21 was broadly in line as the company saw sequential recovery across categories. FMCG sustained broad-based double digit growth, and cigarettes continued sequential recovery. Cigarette net revenue/vol/EBIT clocked -8/-7/-8% YoY growth vs. our expectation of -3/-7/-7% growth. Comparable FMCG growth at 11% was ahead of peers like Britannia (6% YoY). Urban growth continued to lag rural for cigarettes, although the product mix improved. Increased mobility of consumers and gradual return to offices will support recovery in cigarettes over the next few months. FMCG continues to shine as new launches and the essentials portfolio maintained its momentum, and ITC continued to capitalise on the high demand for health, hygiene and packaged food products. OOH and discretionary categories are expected to continue the strong growth witnessed in 3QFY21.

Outlook

We remain optimistic on the company’s ability to delivery healthy earnings growth and maintain our EPS estimates for FY22/FY23. We value ITC on SoTP to derive a target price of Rs 245 (implied P/E of 18x P/E Mar-23E EPS). MaintainBUY.

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

ITC’s Q3FY2021 cigarettes sales volume declined by ~7% (net sales declined by ~8%), better than 12% volume decline (net sales decline of 14%) in Q2FY2021. Non-cigarette FMCG maintained its double-digit revenue growth momentum and margin scale up; business revenue grew by 11% on comparable basis and margins were up by 150 bps to 9.2% (YTD EBIDTA margin stood at 8.9% versus FY2020 EBIDTA margin of 6.8%). With no increase in tax rate on cigarettes, we expect cigarette sales volume to gradually pick up; FMCG is gaining good traction and will maintain its double-digit revenue growth and OPM expansion. Hotel business is expected to come back on track in FY2022.

Outlook

The stock is currently trading at discounted valuation of 16.1x its FY2023E EPS. Consistent improvement in non-cigarette FMCG margins along with normalisation of cigarette would be key re-rating trigger for the stock. We maintain Buy with a revised PT of Rs. 265.

ITC’s FMCG business continues its upward trajectory with 11% comparable sales growth and 9.2% EBIDTA margins. Cigarette volume continue to disappoint with 5% decline. Hotel business also turned EBITDA positive in Dec’20 though we do not expect it to impact overall EBITDA significantly. We believe strong sales momentum in Foods, Hygiene and growth across the discretionary portfolio will aid in overall recovery. We believe ITC would be one of the key beneficiary of an uptick in consumer demand given the depth and width of its portfolio, fast paced launches and innovations. We believe sustained double digit EBIDTA margins in FMCG business by FY22/23 and relative stable cigarette tax regime can re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 17.3x FY23 EPS, ~45% discount to our coverage universe with 4% dividend yield and 4.4% PBT CAGR over FY20-23.



Outlook

Credit Suisse

Credit Suisse has kept outperform rating on the stock with a target at Rs 265 per share. The cigarette recovery augers well for FY22 with healthy FMCG performance.

Research house remain positive on the company as we see strong cigarette recovery. It see potential re-structuring & increasing value of FMCG business, reported CNBC-TV18.

Citi

Research house maintain neutral call on the stock with a target at Rs 215.

Cigarette trends are slightly better than feared, while other FMCG was moderates. The possible news relating to any changes in regulations are key to watch. There will be tracking developments like demerger/value-unlocking of smaller businesses, reported CNBC-TV18.

ITC’s FMCG business continues its upward trajectory with 11% comparable sales growth and 9.2% EBIDTA margins. Cigarette volume continue to disappoint with 5% decline. Hotel business also turned EBITDA positive in Dec’20 though we do not expect it to impact overall EBITDA significantly.

We believe strong sales momentum in Foods, Hygiene and growth across the discretionary portfolio will aid in overall recovery. We believe ITC would be one of the key beneficiary of an uptick in consumer demand given the depth and width of its portfolio, fast paced launches and innovations. Maintain buy with SOTP based target price of Rs254 (valuing cigarette business at 15xFY23 EPS, 59% of value).

Sharekhan

With no major increase in taxes on cigarettes in Union Budget, we expect cigarette sales volume to normalise in the next two quarters. The non-cigarette FMCG business is expected to deliver strong performance due to better reach and strong traction to new launches.

Management’s enhance focus and redefined growth strategies have aided scale of the non-cigarette FMCG business margins. The stock is currently trading at 16.1x its FY2023E EPS. Any sustained scale-up in the margins of the cigarette business coupled with normalisation in the core cigarette business would be key triggers for valuation uptick. We maintain our buy recommendation on the stock with a revised price target of Rs. 265 (19x its FY2023E EPS).

Dolat Capital

We have maintained our FY22/23E EPS estimates Rs 12.7/13.6. Though the stock is trading at a steep discount to other FMCG peers, we believe that the stock would remain under pressure due to volume decline in core cigarette business and falling EBIT margins. Considering recent run-up in the stock price we downgrade the stock to sell with target price of Rs 199.

Cigarette-FMCG-hotel-to-paper major ITC is likely to report 8-9 percent year-on-year decline in profit for the quarter ended December 2020 dented by weak cigarette business.

Revenue from operations may also be reported muted in Q3FY21 as all segments, barring other FMCG, may see tepid performance. Cigarette business volumes could fall 6-8 percent YoY with its EBIT declining 7-10 percent compared to the corresponding period, though month-on-month there may be improvement, while FMCG, other businesses could remain strong with double-digit growth for the quarter.

The stock has rallied 12 percent in February so far, especially after the Budget as government didn't propose any higher taxes on cigarettes, which contribute 40-45 percent to the company's revenue.

The company will declare its December quarter earnings on February 11, along with an interim dividend for the current financial year.

""We model 8 percent decline in cigarette volumes, 1 percent growth in cigarette segmental sales (gross) led by 9 percent price/mix (net sales decline would be marginally higher than volume decline). We forecast 10 percent YoY decline in cigarette EBIT,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 9 percent YoY decline in profit and 3.3 percent fall in revenue.

In the FMCG segment, the brokerage expects health and hygiene portfolio growth to moderate a tad and discretionary portfolio recovery to continue. ""We model 10 percent and 117 percent YoY growth in FMCG revenues and EBIT respectively. We model 320 bps YoY expansion in FMCG PBIT margin.""

According to Emkay Global, FMCG momentum may continue with sales growth of 15 percent, similar to Q2FY21 and a 156 percent rise in EBIT. ""We estimate for other divisions to record flat sales and EBIT decline of 24 percent,"" said the brokerage which feels profit could decline 8 percent YoY and revenue could increase 1 percent YoY in Q3FY21."

Several Indian companies are making plans to buy COVID-19 vaccines for their employees, just days after the country's government began one of the world's largest vaccination drives with healthcare and other frontline workers.

Steel producer Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, autos-to technology conglomerate Mahindra Group and consumer goods giant ITC Ltd have begun initial checks on hopes that vaccines will be available for purchase after the government covers priority segments.

""ITC would certainly like to extend the vaccination to employees... We have approached vaccine manufactures and are in exploratory talks,"" Amitav Mukherji, head of corporate human resources, said.

India is currently using Britain's Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, which is being produced in India by the Serum Institute, and a government-backed alternative developed by India's Bharat Biotech.

Tata Steel said it would get employees inoculated as soon as shots are available commercially.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Indian factories are recovering from one of the world's strictest lockdown last year, which led to large-scale job losses and migration of workers back to their villages.

""We are reaching out to vaccine manufacturers for bulk supply of doses and will try to get these doses after completion of all frontline Covid warriors' vaccination,"" Pankaj Lochan, chief human resource officer, JSPL, said.

The company did not give more details on either the number of doses it plans to buy or with whom it was in talks with.

The world's second-most populous country, India trails only the United States in numbers of COVID-19 infections.

Billionaire Anand Mahindra-led Mahindra Group said it was also interested in buying vaccines for employees ""in accordance with the priorities and sequence to be specified by the government"".

Global consumer goods giant Unilever last week said it was strongly encouraging employees to get vaccinated as soon as possible and floated the idea that it could buy shots to share with people in poorer countries.

As governments rush to inoculate the most vulnerable, however, most corporations globally have so far been quiet on whether they would seek to secure early supplies for employees.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC’s FMCG business reported 18.4% comparable sales growth and 9.7% EBIDTA margins even as 11.5% cigarette volume decline was disappointing. Overall business recovery has set in across segments, although cigarettes, Hotels and Leaf tobacco will have a delayed recovery. We believe strong sales momentum in Foods, Hygiene and success in the frozen snacks and Vegetables is a long term positive given that ITC’s margins have started reflecting impact of cost control and scale. We believe ITC would be one of the key beneficiary of an uptick in consumer demand given the depth and width of its portfolio, fast paced launches and innovations. We believe sustained double digit EBIDTA margins in FMCG business by FY22/23 and relative stable cigarette tax regime can re-rate the stock.



Outlook

ITC trades at 13.3x FY23 EPS, ~65% discount to our coverage universe with 5% dividend yield and 6.7% PBT CAGR over FY20-23. Maintain BUY with SOTP based target price of Rs254 (valuing cigarette business at 15xFY23 EPS, 59% of value).For all recommendations report, click here

Dolat Capital Market's research report on ITC

ITC’s Q2FY21 revenue and APAT came ahead of our estimates. The Cigarette business posted ~3.9% YoY de-growth, vs est of 5% decline. Our analysis suggests 10%+ volume decline in cigarette business. A 880bps decline in margin in the Cigarette business indicates that the product mix was unfavorable and economy brand contribution must have increased during the quarter. Significant increase in duty has resulted in widening of price gap between ITC and smuggled cigarettes. We believe that this would continue to pressurize volume growth going ahead. FMCG business exhibited strong performance with 15.4% revenue increase and 390bps margin expansion. We have upward revised our FY21E and FY22E EPS estimates to Rs 11.0 (+3.9%) and Rs 12.7 (+5.7%) to factor in Q2 performance and introduced FY23E EPS at Rs 13.6.

Outlook

Though the stock is trading at a steep discount to other FMCG peers, we believe that the stock would remain under pressure. Therefore, we maintain Reduce with TP of Rs 187.

HDFC Securities research report on ITC

ITC delivered a mixed bag result in a challenging environment. Most OOH consumption categories were impacted in 2Q, and the cigarettes category was not left out. Cigarette net revenue/vol/EBIT clocked -14/-12/-16% growth as compared to our expectation of -8/-10/-8% YoY. FMCG revenue growth was at 15% (HSIE 12.5%), better than Nestle/Britannia (10/11% YoY). EBIT/EBITDA margin was at 6.7/9.7% (HSIE 3.6/7%). Localised lockdowns impacted the recovery in August to mid-Sep for cigarettes, which was witnessed in JuneJuly. Key markets like Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu were weak with COVID impact. Cigarette mix was also unfavourable and impacted margin. Volume recovery at the end of the quarter is a positive sign. FMCG continues to shine, and ITC is capitalising the high demand for health, hygiene and packaged food products.

Outlook

We cut our EPS estimate for FY21 by 3% while maintaining it for FY22/FY23. We value ITC on SoTP and maintain target price at Rs 236 (implied P/E of 18x P/E Sep-22E EPS). Maintain BUY.

Sharekhan's research repor on ITC

ITC’s Q2FY2021 performance was affected by localised lockdowns in July-August resulting in a 12% decline in volume of core-cigarette business (net sales was down by ~14%). Cigarette sales started recovering from September but yet to reach pre-COVID levels. Non-cigarette FMCG performed strongly, rising by 18.4% led by staples, operating profit grew 66% y-o-y to Rs. 366 crore (margins rose 300 bps to 9.7%). As non-cigarette FMCG business scales up, its OPM is expected to improve further and would remain stable (despite normalisation of sales in some categories in the post-COVID era). Stock trades at discounted valuation of 12.3x its FY2023E EPS, consistent improvement in the non-cigarette FMCG margins along with normalisation of cigarette business would be key re-rating trigger for the stock.

Outlook

We maintain Buy with an unchanged price target of Rs. 250.

Here are the brokerages view on the stock:

ICICIdirect

Given, the completion of capex in hotels segment and ITC not venturing into many newer FMCG categories, broking firm believe the capital allocation would rationalise. ITC would continue to pay 80% dividend with 20% being kept for any capex or acquisition opportunities.

The company has Rs 24,000 crore of cash or equivalents. It value the stock on an SOTP basis valuing cigarette business at 11x FY23E price to earning & FMCG business at 5x FY23E price to sales with a target price of Rs 225 & buy recommendation.

Motilal Oswal

Broking house cut FY21/FY22 EPS by 3.7%/1.4% due to continued weak cigarette volumes affecting overall profitability.

Dividend yield of 4–5% is expected over the next two years. Moreover, the company is likely to see relief from cigarette sales rebounding to near pre-COVID levels. However, these are not clear positives, as global ESG concerns persist on cigarettes (85% of EBIT in FY20), there is an overhang of a further GST increase on cigarettes, and the earnings trajectory would continue to be weak (6.6% PBT CAGR over the last five years, now followed by even lower 2% CAGR expectation over FY20–FY22).

It value ITC at 14x Sep’22E EPS, at ~20% premium to global peers’ average one-year forward multiple (Philip Morris at ~14x and BAT at ~9x), to arrive at target price of Rs 185. Maintain neutral.

Prabhudas Lilladher

Prabhudas Lilladher believe strong sales momentum in Foods, Hygiene and success in the frozen snacks and Vegetables is a long term positive given that ITC’s margins have started reflecting impact of cost control and scale.

It believe ITC would be one of the key beneficiary of an uptick in consumer demand given the depth and width of its portfolio, fast paced launches and innovations.

It believe sustained double digit EBIDTA margins in FMCG business by FY22/23 and relative stable cigarette tax regime can re-rate the stock. ITC trades at 13.3x FY23 EPS, ~65% discount to its coverage universe with 5% dividend yield and 6.7% PBT CAGR over FY20-23. Maintain buy with SOTP based target price of Rs 254 (valuing cigarette business at 15xFY23 EPS, 59% of value).

Sharekhan

The cigarette business is expected to regain normalcy by Q4. Non-cigarette FMCG business is expected to deliver strong performance on the back of better reach and strong traction to new launches. The management’s enhanced focus and redefined growth strategies have aided scale of the non-cigarette FMCG business margins.

The stock is currently trading at 12.3x its FY2023E EPS which factors in near-term headwinds. Any sustained scale-up in margins of the noncigarettes FMCG business and normalisation in the core cigarette business would be key triggers for a valuation uptick. Maintain buy recommendation on the stock with unchanged price target of Rs 250.

Dolat Capital

Dolat Capital upward revised its FY21E and FY22E EPS estimates to Rs 11 (+3.9%) and Rs 12.7 (+5.7%) to factor in Q2 performance and introduced FY23E EPS at Rs 13.6.

Though the stock is trading at a steep discount to other FMCG peers, it believe that the stock would remain under pressure. Therefore, maintain reduce with target price of Rs 187.

Cigarette-hotel-to-FMCG major ITC is expected to report a decline in earnings on all parameters for the quarter ended September 2020, on the back of weak performance in cigarettes, hotels and stationery products segments due to local lockdowns. However, FMCG, other segments could report strong growth during lockdowns.

Brokerages expect the adjusted profit to decline around 20 percent YoY with 5-7 percent fall in revenue from operations YoY, though sequentially earnings may remain strong with double-digit growth on a low base in Q1 FY21.

""Cigarette - sales were weak in July and August due to local lockdowns while September saw some normalisation.

What are Fibonacci Ratios?

Fibonacci retracements are popular among technical traders. They are based on the key numbers identified by mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci in the 13th century. Fibonacci's sequence of numbers is not as important as the mathematical relationships, expressed as ratios, between the numbers in the series.

The Fibonacci sequence is as follows:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610…

Each number in the series is the addition of the previous two numbers as shown below.

233 = 144 + 89

144 = 89 + 55

89 = 55 +34

There are some interesting properties of the Fibonacci series. Further into the ratio properties, one can find remarkable consistency when a number is in the Fibonacci series is divided by its immediate succeeding number.

For example:

89/144 = 0.618

144/233 = 0.618

377/610 = 0.618

The ratio 0.618 when expressed in percentage is 61.8 percent.

In technical analysis, a Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two swing points or two pivot points, on a stock chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios of 23.6 percent, 38.2 percent, 50 percent, 61.8 percent, and 100 percent.

Why to buy ITC?

Fibonacci retracements are popular tools that traders use to draw support lines, identify resistance levels, place stop-loss orders and set target prices. Fibonacci retracements suffer from the same drawbacks as other universal trading tools, so they are best used in conjunction with other indicators.

Generally, prices retrace towards the important ratio of 61.8 percent as a part of correction, from there chances of taking support and showing reversal move is highly possible.

In the case of ITC, prices touched 61.8 percent ratio recently, took support and managed to trade higher in the previous week. There are chances that original trend will continue as long as ITC trades above the 164-mark. At the same time, prices managed to close above the high of the last seven trading sessions, a sign of trend reversal and breakout too. Moreover, this stock has closed above its short-term moving average 20 DMA, standing at around 169-mark, indicating that the correction is complete and the original up-trend will resume. Figure.1.

Looking at Fibonacci retracement levels and anticipating conclusion of correction leg, one can initiate long position for higher targets of 23.6 percent retracements. However, moving further Rs 205 will attract more profit-booking. So one can consider booking profit near Rs 192 and higher side towards Rs 205 mark.

Stop Loss

The entire bullish view negates on a breach of the immediate swing low and in for ITC, we will consider Rs 160 as a stoploss level on a closing basis.

Conclusion

We recommend buying ITC at around Rs 170 with a stop loss of Rs 160 for higher targets of Rs 192 as indicated in the above chart.

Premium cold-pressed juice maker Raw Pressery is in talks with multiple packaged consumer goods firms, including ITC and the Paper Boat brand, to divest stake or get on board a strategic investor for the juices division, officials said.

According to an Economic Times report, the officials said the sale is being valued anywhere between Rs 150 and Rs 200 crore.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

Having raised over Rs 200 crore in equity and debt from the likes of investors like Alteria Capital, Sequoia Capital, Saama Capital, and DSG Consumer Partners, the juice maker is now facing headwinds as consumers in key urban markets downtrade and opt for cheaper juices, according to an official cited in the report.

Raw Pressery had planned to diversify its range of offerings which also includes fresh foods, but has been unable to achieve the scale in the newer businesses, the report said.

“Scale operations and share can be gained if the brand makes it big in the in-home consumption basket. So far, it hasn’t been able to crack that space and has remained a niche premium player,” one of the officials quoted by ET said.

A mailed query to Anuj Rakyan, founder and managing director, Raw Pressery, remained unanswered. ITC did not respond to the paper's query.

For a firm like ITC, a premium juices brand matches its stated objective to build a diversified FMCG portfolio and reducing its dependence on the cigarette business.

ITC crossed Rs 10,000 crore in sales in 2019-20 and is recognized as India's third-largest listed packaged foods company. B Natural, one of its juice brands operates in the mass-premium segment. It competes with the likes of Dabur’s Real and PepsiCo’s Tropicana.

Another competitor for the buyout could be Hector Beverages, according to the officials, which produces Paper Boat, a range of ethnic fruit-based drinks. According to the Economic Times report, co-founder of Hector Beverages Neeraj Kakkar declined to comment on the matter."

The germ-protection soap market is getting crowded. Tata Consumer recently joined the market. Major brands like ITC, Reckitt Benckiser, and Hindustan Unilever are already present there. In fact, ITC is planning more launches.

Is this just a mad rush to grab market share or is there more to it? Moneycontrol spoke to a few brand analysts and experts to find out.

‘It makes business sense’

Some brand experts do see business sense in it. In the current germ-protection-obsessed market, it makes immense sense to market soaps in any avatar, promising hygiene and germ protection.

“Most FMCG companies have expanded their range during COVID. Anybody who had a chance to move in to areas anti-bacterial or germ has launched it,” said N Chandramouli, CEO of TRA Research, a consumer analytics and brand insights company.

Figures support the argument. The Indian soap market, which was worth $2.9 billion in FY20, is estimated to cross $4.4 billion by FY26 due to the increasing focus on maintaining proper hygiene and rising disposable incomes.

‘It’s not just about money’

Pavan Padaki, a brand consultant and coach, presented a different angle.

“It’s not just about making money. From a brand point of view, it is important to stay relevant to the current customer base and needs. Companies have to ensure that their customers don’t look at other brands to solve new needs. This is required to fence both its loyal and potential customers,” he said.

From a business point of view, brands are adding another potential hot-seller to existing categories, which are well-established with robust distribution chain and channels to gain immediate and profitable ROIs (Return on Investment),” added Padaki.

In fact, some analysts see a different potential here. The current market potential for hygiene products is an opportunity for replacing low-ROI brands with market-relevant products, they believe.

No wonder, even existing players are adding more products in the segment.

Companies and products

Up for launch next is ITC’s neem and glycerine soaps. It is expected to hit the stores in a month. ITC is already present in the premium soap category and sells under the brand -- Fiama Di Wills and Vivel.

In between, in mid-July, Tata Consumer joined the bandwagon. The company launched its germ-protection soap brand Skye in three variants -- anti-bacterial, menthol, and jojoba oil.

Dabur, an existing player, followed up by adding the Sanitize soap brand to its collection. Emami has already launched a Boroplus soap.

ITC (Savlon), Reckitt Benckiser (Dettol), and Hindustan Unilever (Lifebuoy) are the major existing brands.

None of the companies are willing to talk as they are observing what is called a silent period ahead of the announcement of quarterly results. The Q2 results of these firms are due in a few weeks.

Although there is no data to verify how the soap category has fared during COVID-19 times, in the last interaction, after HUL’s Q1 results, Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Mehta had told Moneycontrol that Lifebuoy products are the hot-sellers for the company.

The Indian soap industry

According to Research and Markets, an online platform that provides market and research data from publishers, consultants, and analysts, the soap manufacturing industry is one of the biggest in the FMCG space in India, accounting for more than 50 percent of the consumer goods sector.

Due to increasing awareness about hygiene standards, around 50 percent soaps are sold in the rural market.

How soap helps

A study by WHO shows that just by washing hands properly with soap and water helps cut down stomach-related illnesses by 50 percent and respiratory infections by 16 percent.

In a blog on Unilever website, Sayandip Mukherjee, a virologist and Senior Research Scientist at Unilever R&D, Bengaluru, explains: “Some germs have an outer protective covering made up of two layers of fatty molecules. Soaps can help to break apart this outer protective layer, trapping and removing these germs along with any other oils and debris that are present in our hands. Now, for a soap to do all this, remember we must wash our hands for at least 20 seconds.”"

ICICI Direct has come out with its second quarter (July-September 20) earnings estimates for the FMCG sector. The brokerage house expects ITC to report net profit at Rs. 3417.5 crore up 15.1% year-on-year (up 45.9% quarter-on-quarter).

Net Sales are expected to decrease by 2.3 percent Y-o-Y (up 22.9 percent Q-o-Q) to Rs. 11,594.6 crore, according to ICICI Direct.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are likely to fall by 10.3 percent Y-o-Y (up 54.5 percent Q-o-Q) to Rs. 4,090.2 crore.

The next time you order food using an app, you can also order groceries. In a bid to reach out to consumers, most FMCG companies have formed partnerships for delivery of essentials as customers have been avoiding stepping out for fear of getting infected with the deadly Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus.

In the past few months, FMCG companies ITC, Marico and Godrej Consumer Products, among others, have partnered with food service aggregators Zomato and Swiggy, as well as delivery services Dunzo and Scootsy.

Brand experts, however, see this more as a matter of opportunity rather than a collaboration.

“Brands are coming together and trying to create marketplace access wherever they can. Covid has proven that you cannot be a specialist anymore. You need to be a generalist. Tie-ups will help brands create effectiveness of value, service, cost,” said N Chandramouli, CEO of TRA Research, a consumer analytics and brand insights company.

Unusual tie-ups

The country has also witnessed some unsual partnerships in the FMCG space, wherein even cab aggregators and car rental firms have joined hands.

Adidas has tied up with McDonalds: The two brands have joined hands to put out a collection of three sneakers inspired by the heritage of both brands under the title 'The Sauce Pack'.

The three sneakers will be inspired by popular basketball legends James Harden, Damian Lillard and Tracy McGrady, as well as famous sauces sold at McDonald's outlets globally.

Another unusual tie-up is between Dabur and SIS for supply of PPEs, including masks and gloves. The companies have launched a Covid-19 Safety Kit, which comes with different kinds of masks, gloves and sanitisers. SIS is known for its security business and facilities management.

Car rental firm Zoomcar has also joined the bandwagon, tying up with Bigbasket, Grofers and Milkbasket for last-mile delivery of essentials. Cab aggregator Uber, too, has tied up with Bigbasket.

Harnessing synergies

Brand guru Harish Bijoor, feels that unusual partnerships happen during unusual times. “The most disparate looking brands wed in such times. The idea is all about reaching out to the consumer using the collective synergies of brands so conjoined. Consumers appreciate the effort and both sets of brands accrue positive strokes,” said Bijoor, founder of Harish Bijoor Consults Inc.

Pavan Padaki, branding coach and consultant, believes that the traditional way of viewing products and services as two distinct baskets of business seems to be a thing of the past.

He pointed out that it is now more about fulfilment or answering a need in totality, either adding a service to a product or adding a product in a service business to make it a complete and a wholesome proposition.

This product-cum-service combo delivery not only helps differentiate and fight competition but also helps garner new customers.

In the coming days, many unusual partnerships could end up becoming business as usual, Padaki said."

Commenting on sector performance, Puri said fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) segment, especially staples, has 'done well' while discretionary segments “are a bit muted” and cigarettes “has been hit due to certain restrictions.”

“In FMCG, we will aim for industry leading growth. The margin expansion trajectory looks good. When tax rate increases, cigarette revenue grows slower. The company’s cigarette business does well during stable tax regime,” he said.



“FMCG's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin are on a robust trajectory on scale advantages and premiumisation efforts. We have launched 41 new products in the first three to four months of the lockdown and are in a good position to harness growth in consumer business,” he added.

Puri said shareholder value is top priority, adding that he was 'surprised' by the stock price underperformance. “We have looked at various suggestions which have come in with respect to the capital allocation, dividend distribution, restructuring, among others,” he said.

On the hotels business, Puri said the company will “explore alternate structures” and that “timelines may get delayed due to COVID-19.”

ITC share price jumped 4 percent in the morning trade on October 12 after CLSA upgraded the stock to buy.

The research firm has upgraded the stock to buy from outperform with the target at Rs 220 per share. It is of the view that the FMCG firm's long-term positives are unfolding as revenue diversifies and the FMCG segment is set to become a major value driver, CNBC-TV18 reported.

ITC's legacy cigarette business is providing cash to meet its ambitious goals. It expects FMCG to deliver an EBITDA CAGR of 30 percent in FY20-23, adding that value-accretive acquisitions and improving capital allocation will provide support.

The stock was trading Rs 6.60, or 3.93 percent, higher. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 174.50 and an intraday low of Rs 169.95.

Kolkata-based ITC Ltd, which has been acquiring companies in the personal care segment over the last few years, is looking for more acquisitions in the segment, said Sameer Satpathy, chief executive - personal care, on October 7.

“We remain hungry for lucrative acquisitions. It should be value accretive and one that helps to grow and build a strong brand,” he said in a virtual conference to discuss acquisitions made by ITC in the segment.

In 2015, ITC acquired Savlon and Shower to Shower from Johnson & Johnson marking its entry into the health and hygiene space.

In 2018, it acquired floor cleaning brand Nimyle from Kolkata-based Arpita Agro Products.

ITC's personal care portfolio includes brands such as Essenza Di Wills, Fiama, Vivel, Engage, Savlon, Charmis, Shower to Shower, Nimyle, Nimwash and Superia brands.

The consumer spending on Savlon in FY20 stood at Rs 250 crore, and Satpathy expects it to touch Rs 1,000 crore by the end of the current financial year (FY21) in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If that happens then Savlon will become the first Rs 1,000-crore brand in the personal care business for ITC.

“When we acquired the brand, they only had soap and antiseptic liquid. Now we have Savlon Handwash, Savlon Hand Sanitiser, Savlon Multipurpose Disinfectant Cleaner, Savlon Wipes, Savlon Surface Disinfectant Spray. We are expecting that the brand will touch Rs 1,000 crore by the end of this year as most consumers are buying Savlon products during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.

He further pointed out that the Savlon portfolio has grown around three-four times during the pandemic.

In May this year, ITC had launched fruits and vegetable wash called Nimwash. It also had the Nimyle brand which sells floor cleaners. Satpathy envisages the consumer spending on both to reach around Rs 150-160 crore by the end of FY21.

ITC reported a 26 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall in standalone net profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, at Rs 2,342.76 crore.

However, the personal care products business recorded substantial growth in revenue, driven by heightened awareness and demand for hygiene products such as hand sanitisers, handwash, antiseptic liquids and floor cleaners in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

But brands such as Engage witnessed a tepid quarter due to a significant decline in demand."
"September 29, 2020 09:55 AM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/analysts-bullish-on-itcs-fmcg-and-food-segment-prospects-5897791.html,"ITC products (Image: Moneycontrol)

Investment analysts sounded a bullish on the prospects of a positive turnaround for the ITC stock, latest research reports show.

As per JM Financial, the addressable opportunity for ITC is still USD 2,200 crore.

“ITC’s FMCG segment is possibly one of the most under-appreciated businesses in the Indian consumer space in recent times, in our view. We suspect the market may not have taken a holistic look yet; our understanding of Indian consumer categories tells us that ITC FMCG today addresses market opportunities that are Rs 2.1 lakh crore in size in aggregate,” JM Financial said in a research report.

“Even if one excludes a couple of nascent dairy products from the portfolio, the addressable opportunity for ITC is still Rs 2.1 lakh crore- larger than even HUL’s ‘size of markets’ and more than 3x that of Nestle India’s,” it said.

“Profitability is low at present, but we reckon that with investment-phase largely done (though some new categories are still in incubation stages), profits and cash-generation would get much bigger here onwards,” the JM Financial research report said.

According to Centrum Broking, a “deep dive analysis” into ITC's foods business shows that “it is at the cusp of a take-off both in terms of top-line and margins.”

“ITC is emerging as a foods company, more comparable to Nestle than HUL. Branded packed food consistently gaining saliency given the management focus (saliency increased from 71 per cent of other FMCG in FY14 to 81 per cent in FY20),” it added.

It is the only company which has successful brands from staples (Aashirvaad) to RTC and RTE (Sunfeast, Bingo, Yippee etc.). ITC has made consistent investments in brand building over the past decade helping create brands across the branded packed food categories from staples a and dairy to RTC and RTE. Aashirvaad, Sunfeast, Bingo and Yippee now account for Rs 60 billion, 40 billion, 27 billion and 13 billion in consumer spend terms,” the Centrum report said.

“Going ahead foods division will drive both its top-line and bottom-line: Food business has enough arrows in its quiver ranging from industry growth, brand maturity to efficiency gains etc. that will help other FMCG segment to drive revenue/EBITDA CAGR of 11.7%/34.0% over FY20-23E,” the report said.

According to BNP Paribas, there is a faster than expected recovery in ITC's cigarette business. The catalyst for ITC is a faster than expected recovery in cigarette volumes and higher than expected margin expansion in the FMCG business.

As per B&K Securities, a turnaround in cigarette volumes is expected from September onwards. ""We believe the gradual lifting of start/stop lockdowns in most states, opening up of bars/clubs in some states and more attendance in offices due to lesser fears from Covid-19 will lead to the marginal smoker slowly coming back. Given the fact that 30 per cent of the smokers' user base comprises of non-regular smokers who have been impacted by the start/stop lockdowns, we feel the industry figures will start looking up from September 2020,"" it added."

By the looks of it, Indian conglomerates, investment firms, global food majors and local promoters have taken a cue from Gilbert in their pursuit of happiness. And as acquirers, they know 2020 is the time to sprinkle their dry powder stockpile and unlock the secrets of the domestic branded spices market.

The year has emerged as the busiest ever for the niche segment which has been sizzling with merger & acquisition (M&A) activity on the back of consistent double-digit growth over the past seven years.

Just sample the deals struck so far.

It all started with tobacco-to-hotels conglomerate ITC acquiring Kolkata-based Sunrise Foods for Rs 2,150 crore. Then, in mid-June, Paper Boat backer and home grown fund A91 partners invested Rs 125 crore in Push Spices, the maiden fundraising round for the Indore-based firm.

Earlier this month, Norway’s Orkla announced its second acquisition in India after the acquisition of MTR Foods in 2017. The firm, which has a strong base in the Nordic and Baltic markets, announced the acquisition of a controlling stake in Kerala’s largest spices player Eastern Condiments in a transaction that values the target at Rs 2,000 crore.

And the fourth successive deal in the segment was sealed recently by the Jhaveri family, the promoters of Badshah Masala. Moneycontrol learns that an internal restructuring exercise has kicked off as part of which Hemant Jhaveri will acquire the 24 percent stake held by his cousin, Kailash Jhaveri, for around Rs 130 crore, valuing the firm at Rs 540 crore. The cousins intend to part ways and go solo.

Prior to these transactions, the 2014-2020 period saw relatively fewer and smaller deals. According to data compiled by Venture Intelligence, a few examples include frozen snacks manufacturer Foods & Inns acquiring Kusum Spices for Rs 14 crore, Medimix brand owner AVA group acquiring the Kerala-based Melam brand of masalas and spices, and Swiss major Firmenich scooping up Kerala’s VKL Seasonings from PE firm True North for an undisclosed amount.

So why the sudden surge in deal activity in India — the world’s largest producer, consumer and exporter of spices? Just like all the ingredients of a sumptuous Malabar chicken curry, a smorgasbord of factors have blended together to create the perfect playground for dealmakers.

Let’s take a look at them:

COVID-19 accelerates shift to branded products

For starters, loose spices are passé. Health, hygiene and quality-conscious Indians living in the COVID-19 era have warmed up to packaged and value-added spices like never before.

Demand for such products has skyrocketed, and growth projections are being reworked. And that spells good news not only for the likes of Sunrise, Eastern Condiments, Push Spices and Badshah Masala but also their branded peers like MDH, Everest, Catch, Mothers Recipe and Priya.

Moving into new categories

Secondly, the spices segment presents a mouth-watering opportunity to extend into other food categories like pickles, sauces, chutneys and curries. The prospect of seamlessly adding additional categories to one’s portfolio is indeed tempting. Perhaps that is why private equity firm General Atlantic was eyeing Badshah Masala in late 2019, through its investee company Capital Foods, the owner of the popular ""Chings Secret"" brand of instant noodles and sauces.

The addition of sub-segments plays a role as well. Though this wasn’t the deal-driving factor, let’s take the case of the Orkla-Eastern Condiments deal. Eastern offers a mix of non-vegetarian and vegetarian food products in the categories of blended and single spices. MTR Foods, on the other hand, has a pure vegetarian portfolio.

Key details which reinvigorate sectors and valuations

Sometimes all it takes is one big initial deal to shake up an entire sector, spur consolidation and make stakeholders optimistic. Back in 2010, the Rs 17,000-crore Piramal Healthcare-Abbott Labs deal did that for the pharma sector. Many believe the ITC-Sunrise deal will do the same for the spice sector in 2020. One of them is Gopal Agrawal, Co-Head, Investment Banking at Edelweiss.

“Yes, It ( ITC-Sunrise deal) does change the valuation expectations of many upcoming sale processes in food ingredients, especially the spices segment and may also result in many other regional players seeking funding/strategic partnerships,” he says. Sources familiar with the transaction peg the valuation at a whopping ‘25x plus’ or more than 25 times EBITDA.

Now, this may have perked up expectations of potential sellers, but may not necessarily set a benchmark for the sector.

Agrawal is quick to add that valuations in the spices segment cannot be standardised. “It will always vary based on the actual company profile, size, competitive intensity in that region, quality of books and corporate governance,” he says.

Typically, in the consumer foods segment, EBITDA margins are linked to advertising and marketing spends. The other key spices deal this year—Orkla-Eastern Condiments—had a transaction multiple of 18.6x, according to a presentation by the former.

The regional factor

Inherently, most firms in the branded spices segment are local, family-run players. “Many of these family-run businesses are home-grown legacy brands. Some players have succession issues or differences between multiple family factions who are involved in the business. Each of these local leader brands are sitting on a high market share in their home markets. As they expand to new and neighbouring states, an institutional approach with professional management will be needed. Hence, local leader brands are open to considering partnerships with larger players or financial investors which can help in institutionalising the business and scaling it to the next level” says Anshul Agrawal, Co-Head, Consumer, Financial Institutions Group & Business Services, at Avendus Capital.

Srikrishna Dwaram, a partner at private equity firm True North, agrees. “Expansion into other markets on their own has been a tough challenge for family-owned regional players. That's probably why big players with wider distribution reach are finding it attractive to buy such businesses,” he says.

The strength of the brand, distribution, understanding of a region’s customer preferences are key factors in creating a strong product portfolio. One also needs to keep in mind that the nuances of spices vary by region in much the same way as food habits.

The chillies preferred in Uttar Pradesh are not consumed in Kerala, and may be different from the variety that suits the Maharashtrian palette. But regional players who are sub-scale and not ranked in the top three are not expected to excite acquirers.

Expanding footprint

When ITC decided to utilise its Rs 30,000-crore war chest and announced the acquisition of Sunrise Foods in May, the street cheered the move as it would strengthen the conglomerate’s spices division in east India.

The Sanjiv Puri-led firm was looking to bolster its food business and battle the likes of HUL, Pepsico and Britannia. It was the biggest cheque signed for a buyout by ITC, which already had a presence in the branded spices category through its ‘Aashirvaad’ brand, a market leader in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Upbeat brokerages expected significant synergies on sourcing and distribution due to its pan-India presence.

Sunrise’s operations are largely centred in east India, including the northeastern states. It has also expanded to Bangladesh and Nepal. ITC added that the deal would “augment the company’s product portfolio and is aligned to ITC’s aspiration to significantly scale up its spices business and expand its footprint across the country.”

Ditto with the Orkla-Eastern Condiments deal. The acquisition vehicle MTR Foods had a strong presence in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and could now push its products in the Kerala market.

Their portfolios are complementary and both players have a deep knowledge of south Indian cuisine. Prior to the deal, the MTR Foods portfolio was tilted towards instant mixes. Interestingly, the Gulab Jamun instant mix is their smash-hit product. Now, the combined entity has a formidable presence in the south.

The spice route ahead

Not surprisingly, dealmakers expect to see the next wave of investments in the packaged foods industry, which has limited quality targets.

India’s food-service market (organised and unorganised) was estimated at Rs 3.3 lakh crore in 2017 and projected to grow to Rs 5.5 lakh crore by 2022, according to a FICCI-Technopak report.

“Packaged foods have seen an uptick in interest from both strategic and financial investors. Spices are amongst the most sought-after segments as it has some strong regional brands with proven quality and expertise in sourcing and authentic blends. One can’t easily penetrate this category from scratch,” says Nitin Gupta, National Leader (Strategy & Transactions), Consumer & Healthcare, EY.

Industry experts believe the days ahead will see better value-added products, sleeker packaging, more variants especially in western spices (eg oregano, chilli flakes) and a higher market share of organised players.

Dealmakers are rubbing their hands with glee, eager to cook up an M&A storm!"

Even as most companies from the FMCG sector have resumed normal operations since June after Unlock 1.0 started in India, the road ahead for the sector looks bumpy.

Media reports suggest most companies have resumed normal operations from June and witnessed the benefit of pent-up demand. Rural growth has been ahead of urban, and this trend is likely to sustain in FY21.

The rabi harvest was good, Kharif sowing was off to a great start, rural cash flows were looking up and the pandemic did not wreak havoc in the rural areas.

This optimism was reflected in the earnings of FMCG companies who also benefitted from benign raw material prices.

However, brokerages are not convinced about the growth prospects of the sector and advise to be highly selective while picking stocks from the sector.

""We remain cautious and selective within the sector due to the unfavourable medium-term risk-reward, given modest absolute growth relative to expectations and valuations. Despite defensive characteristics, we are underweight on the sector in our model portfolio,"" said HDFC Securities.

The outbreak of COVID-19 triggered lockdown across the country which remained in effect for most of the June quarter. The pandemic and economic stress made consumers shy away from discretionary expenditure and focused on necessities that hit FMCG too like many other sectors.

The shift in trend clearly reflected in the first-quarter performance of FMCG companies such as ITC, Hindustan Unilever, Marico, Dabur, and Britannia.

With health & hygiene categories in focus, discretionary categories were on the slow lane.

While the trends of demand are expected to be normal in the coming months, valuations of FMCG stocks have made them less attractive.

""While FMCG should continue to witness a good demand, upsides would be limited for the sector given rich valuations,"" said Jyoti Roy, DVP- Equity Strategist, Angel Broking.

HDFC Securities underscored that In the past five months after COVID-19 steadily impacted FMCG companies, they have seen steep volatility. In the initial period of the disease’s impact, the fall in the stock prices was sharp for most companies but less than that in Nifty50.

However, in the later phase (past three months), Nifty outperformed the FMCG sector - it gained by 12 percent while NSE FMCG rose by only 4 percent.

The COVID-19 pandemic weighed on the performance of most companies in the first quarter of FY21.

ITC reported a 26 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall in standalone net profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, at Rs 2,342.76 crore.

HUL reported a standalone profit of Rs 1,881 crore for the quarter, a growth of 7.2 percent compared to the previous quarter, supported by a sharp fall (down 31.4 percent) in advertising and promotion expenses, and strong double-digit growth in the foods and refreshment segment.

Marico reported a robust 23.2 percent rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 2020 at Rs 388 crore as against Rs 315 crore in the year-ago period

In a post-pandemic world, demand for certain categories, like health and hygiene and packaged food, would remain at an elevated level, and ITC would be prepared to cater to that demand, said Sanjiv Puri, chairman and managing director, ITC on September 7.

""In the new normal, we are seeing a surge in certain categories. When the pandemic gets over, certain categories will settle at an elevated level. When I say elevated level, it is in comparison to pandemic situation, but may not have the surge seen during the pandemic. So health and hygiene could be one such category, but the awareness and importance of simple things like hand washing and cleanliness would definitely go up,"" said Puri at a virtual press interaction.

He said the need to clean fruits and vegetables has been accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic and with the availability of scientific solutions like ITC Nimwash, the demand for such things would increase going forward.

""Maybe sanitisers won't be at a level as today, but it will certainly be at an elevated level going forward. We also have to prepare now for the next normal... That's were the adaptability, creativity and resilience of the enterprises would be tested,"" Puri said.

He said as far as capacity is concerned, ITC has expanded its capacity way beyond its buffer capacity. ""Our handwash, for example, is five to six times of what we were producing earlier. Capacity expansion has happened in house by commissioning some additional facilities... We have the infrastructure. What we need to do is we need to add machines over a period of time,"" Puri said.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Manufacture of ITC’s hygiene products like Savlon sanitisers was ramped up by 275 times to cater to the surge in demand. ITC ramped up production capacity and resumed distribution in record time, with focus on safety protocols. Over 180 factories manufacturing essential products in foods, personal care and hygiene as well as paperboards and packaging were progressively made operational.

More than 85 percent of ITC’s associated warehouses were made operational within 10 days of the lockdown.

ITC's gross revenue and PBT (before exceptional items) for FY20 stood at around Rs 46,300 crore and Rs 19,300 crore, respectively. Non-cigarette segment revenue rose to Rs 31,000 crore during the year, accounting for nearly 60 percent of ITC’s total segment revenue.

ITC’s FMCG brands clocked an annual consumer spend of over Rs 19,700 crore in aggregate during the year. Segment EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) recorded a robust growth of 33 percent during the year."

Diversified business entity ITC has accelerated digital transformation under the company’s future-ready strategy to enhance competitive advantage and operational effectiveness, its Chairman Sanjiv Puri has said.

The current pandemic has accelerated manifold the transition to digitalisation that was already moving at high velocity and the company is adopting new-age technologies to stay ahead of the curve, Puri said.

New technologies such as Industry 4.0, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning are being deployed by all Businesses, including supply chain and logistics to enhance operational effectiveness, Puri said while addressing shareholders in his AGM speech.

ITC had made substantial investments for a digital ecosystem to drive ”smart manufacturing, product quality, traceability and supply chain agility, amongst others. This accelerated digital journey has begun to demonstrate appreciable outcomes,” he added.

According to Puri, the pandemic has accelerated the transition to digitalisation and apart from e-commerce, digital entertainment, work-from-home conferencing, telemedicine, education, learning and skill development, e-services, social media communications have all experienced an exponential surge.

ITC’s Marketing Command Centre now leverages ”cloud-technology, cutting-edge social-media engagement tools and a digital marketing & analytics platform” to drive contextual communication and product development rapidly.

""The Centre has today developed into a real-time repository on market trends. Based on the insights gained, several digital campaigns have been rolled out and product variants developed,” he added.

Social media trends like ’Dalgona coffee’ were leveraged to deepen consumer engagement for ITC’s Sunbean Beaten Caffe and introduce a new variant in a long shelf life ambient format.

ITC has also launched an online ordering system for retailers to address the surge in demand during the pandemic. ”Enhanced presence across e-commerce platforms led to accelerated growth in sales and marketing of ITC’s FMCG products,” he said.

""Enhanced presence across e-commerce platforms led to accelerated growth in sales and marketing of ITC’s FMCG products,” he said. Its wholly-owned subsidiary, ITC Infotech has developed domain-led expertise in emerging areas of digital and automation solutions and is now the company’s strategic partner in its journey of digital transformation.

”The pandemic saw an explosive adoption of digital tools and platforms, which is poised to redefine business operations and consumer engagement significantly,” said Puri adding ITC would continue to invest in ”building its digital enterprise capacity and capabilities to stay ahead of the curve” and shape formidable strengths for the future."

In the short term, Indian economy will face multi-dimensional challenges in the short term. But, India remains one of the major economies in the world with huge potential.

To capture the potential, companies will have to gear up for 'next normal' and reimagine the future as corporates brace to manage the crisis.

He compares the COVID-19 pandemic with Black Swan event. “Disruptive Black Swan events of the kind we are facing now, not only test resilience and adaptive capacity but can also unleash forces of innovation and creativity to shape a more sustainable and inclusive future,” said Sanjiv Puri, Chairman, ITC Ltd at 109th Annual General Meeting held on September 4.

“I am deeply convinced that the future will belong to purposeful enterprises who will constantly build competitiveness with agility and innovation to respond speedily to external shocks and emerge even stronger from the crisis.”

Puri further pointed out reimagining the future will encompass three distinct phases that will co-exist in the journey ahead.

“First, a ‘Survival’ phase as corporates brace to manage the current crisis. Second, a ‘Reboot’ phase as businesses align to the new normal with certain segments experiencing demand destruction, some new trends emerging whilst several pre-crisis trends gain accelerated pace,"" Puri said.

Third, as the crisis ebbs, corporates will have to gear up for the ‘next normal’ with some trends moderating, some remaining at an elevated level, certain segments witnessing recovery, whilst new opportunities and industry dynamics get constantly redefined,” he added.

To reach millions of consumers confined to their homes, ITC was a first mover in entering into collaborations with companies such as Dominos, Swiggy, Zomato, Dunzo and Amway to leverage their direct to home reach, he said.

The innovative ‘ITC Store on Wheels’ initiative was launched to directly service residential complexes.

Performance, New Launches

Puri also highlighted the performance of ITC for FY20 at the AGM. Gross Revenue and PBT (before exceptional items) for FY20 stood at around Rs 46,300 crores and Rs 19300 crores respectively. Non-cigarette segment revenue rose to Rs 31,000 crores during the year, accounting for nearly 60 percent of ITC’s total segment revenue.

ITC’s FMCG brands clocked an annual consumer spend of over Rs 19,700 crores in aggregate during the year. Segment EBITDA recorded a robust growth of 33 percent during the year.

Puri pointed out that the recent acquisition of Sunrise Foods Private Ltd, which was completed during the lockdown, will further boost ITC’s portfolio of products.

He also said that revenues grew ahead of the industry, amidst subdued demand conditions, and profitability improved significantly.

FMCG-Others Segment delivered comparable revenue growth of 19 percent, whilst Segment EBITDA demonstrated strong growth of 42 percent during the period. This was driven by revenue growth of 34 percent in Staples, Convenience Foods and Health & Hygiene products, which represent 75 percent of the portfolio.

ITC introduced over 40, first-to-market products and variants during the pandemic to meet emerging consumer demand.

During the lockdown, the Savlon portfolio of hygiene products was augmented with differentiated offerings including disinfectant sprays, advanced ‘Hexa’ sanitisers, soaps, body wash, germ protection wipes and so on.

Other products include ‘Nimwash’ - for washing vegetables and fruits, B Natural Plus range of Immunity beverages, Bingo! a range of new snacks, ITC Master Chef frozen foods, were launched to cater to the increasing demand.

Puri also said that the demand for essential products in the food and hygiene segments witnessed a surge.

“The company also witnessed growing preference for organic, naturals and fresh products though consumers also seek indulgence, comfort eating and even resort to ‘revenge’ consumption. Frozen food, ready to eat or cook meals score high on convenience, during these trying times,” said Puri.

""There is a shift to larger basket purchases, large value packs with infrequent shopping frequency. Digital shopping surged exponentially even as neighbourhood grocery stores emerged as the lifeline for essential supplies,” he added."

Amid Covid-induced disruptions, diversified business conglomerate ITC appears to have set an ambitious expansion of its fast-moving-consumer-goods (FMCG) business, with chairman Sanjiv Puri, clearly identifying the segment as the company’s main growth driver, with focus on new products, bold acquisitions and the high-octane marketing.

Puri, who completed a year in office as the company’s chairman, has not shied away from making the company’s intent clear to shed its traditionalist approach on acquisitions in the FMCG space, which may well hold pointers of what could be coming.

In May, it announced the decision to acquire Kolkata-based spice maker Sunrise Foods Pvt. Ltd (SFPL), seen as part of a broader strategy to fortify its position in the country’s highly competitive FMCG market that is dominated by large corporations such as Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL) and several local players in diverse regional geographies.

The acquisition, which was completed in July, involved buying out Sunrise Foods Private Ltd (SFPL) in an “upfront all-cash consideration of at Rs 2,150 crore on a cash-free, debt-free basis”.

SFPL is a Kolkata-based family-owned company engaged primarily in the business of spices, and this acquisition would help ITC augment its portfolio in the segment where it is present with its brand Aashirvaad, whose range of spices has a strong presence in Telengana and Andhra Pradesh.

Sunrise is a market leader in eastern India in the fast-growing spices category and has a brand legacy of over 70 years.

A disaggregated analysis points towards a strategic tilt towards FMCG in recent years.

The earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and ammortisation (EBIDTA) of the new FMCG businesses has more than doubled in three years—growing from from Rs 456 crores in 2017-18 to Rs 914 crores in 2019-20.

Over an eight-year period, segment EBIDTA for the FMCG Businesses has multiplied from Rs 44 crores in 2012-13, a year before Puri was elevated to president of the company’s FMCG business, to Rs 914 crores in 2019-20, galloping at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 54 percent.

In the current financial year, in the first quarter (April-June), ITC’s staples, convenience foods and health and hygiene products, representing around 75 percent of the portfolio (excluding education and stationery products business -EPSB), grew 34 percent, despite the Covid-19-induced lockdown that severely disrupted the broader economy.

During the quarter, the company launched 40 new products, with focus on “future readiness” through a slew of first-to-market products in the hygiene and wellness space such as the Savlon disinfectant spray, the Nimwash fruit and vegetable wash, Savlon germ protection wipes, B Natural Plus immunity supporting juice among others.

“Aggregate consumer spends in the mother brands have risen to Rs 19,700 crore in 2019-20 from about Rs 16,000 crore in 2017-18. Puri has been reiterating the single minded objective to make every business a leader in the segment by strengthening competitiveness and achieving scale,” said a retail analyst, who wished not to identified.

The analyst said that ITC’s foods business, which is the third largest, rapidly narrowing the gap, with some players such as Aashirvaad (Rs 6,000 crore), Sunfeast (Rs 4,000 crore), Bingo (Rs 2,700 crore) and YiPPee (Rs 1,300 crore), achieving significant value and scale.

The restructuring of the lifestyle retailing business with the sale of the John Players brand are all measures to improve profitability of the FMCG segments, he said."

The coronavirus pandemic has completely changed life as we know it. The fear of catching the infection has also led us to adopt a more healthy and hygienic lifestyle.

The shift in trend clearly reflected in the first-quarter performance of FMCG companies such as ITC, Hindustan Unilever, Marico, Dabur, and Britannia.

With health & hygiene categories in focus, discretionary categories were on the slow lane.

The other theme that showed promise for Indian FMCG players was rural demand. The rabi harvest was good, Kharif sowing was off to a great start, rural cash flows were looking up and the pandemic did not wreak havoc in the rural areas. This optimism was reflected in the earnings of FMCG companies who also benefitted from benign raw material prices.

In terms of food items, there was a rising trend of ‘at-home’ as opposed to ‘out-of-home’ consumption. Apart from a thrift mindset, consumers were preferring larger pack formats as they seek to reduce the frequency of purchase.

Which products saw the highest demand?

India’s FMCG major, ITC witnessed the demand for staples, noodles, biscuits, dairy, sanitisers, hand wash, and floor cleaners. On the other hand, discretionary categories and those with relatively higher salience of ‘out-of-home’ consumption witnessed contraction.

The 'B Natural' range of juices particularly immunity range was met with encouraging response from discerning consumers.

Similarly, Hindustan Unilever saw the highest demand during the lockdown for coffee, sanitisers, deep cleaning, and Kissan products. HUL offers a prominent coffee brand, BRU, while sauces and jams fall under the brand Kissan.

Within deep cleaning, HUL offers products such as Domex under the home care category and Lifebuoy under skincare category. Skin Cleansing led by Lifebuoy delivered strong double-digit growth across formats.

Within the food and refreshment category, riding on the in-home and wellness and immunity trends, tea and coffee registered double-digit growth indicating robust demand.

On the other hand, demand for ice creams, skin, colour cosmetics, deodorant were impacted due to supply-led issues and closure of some of the channels that were extremely relevant for the categories

The company has divided its portfolio into three categories-Health, Nutrition, and Hygiene which constitutes 80 percent of the portfolio delivered healthy mid-single-digit domestic consumer growth.

For Marico, Saffola Edible Oils continued its growth journey, posted 16 percent volume growth, building on strong brand credentials, ramped-up presence, and increased in-home consumption. Parachute, their flagship product, remained on a firm footing as lockdown restrictions eased in May and June.

The volume market share of the Coconut Oil franchise which includes Nihar Naturals and Oil of Malabar strengthened by about 180bps to 62 percent.

Nihar Shanti Amla Badam led the recovery in May and June, while among the newer introductions, Parachute Advansed Aloe Vera Enriched Coconut Hair Oil witnessed encouraging trends in June.

Dabur witnessed the demand for Immunity boosting products such as Dabur Chyawanprash and Dabur Honey along with new launches in the hygiene space such as Dabur sanitiser, Dabur veggie wash, Dazzl surface cleaner, Dabur Sanitize disinfectant spray, Dabur Tulsi Drops.

COVID-19 environment helped the consumption of packaged food. Britannia saw demand for biscuits which is their mainstay business as 70-80 percent of revenue comes from biscuits.

Britannia sells biscuits such as Good Day in 9 variants, 50-50 in four variants, nutrichoice in nine variants.

Earnings performance

Unprecedented disruptions in economic activity caused by nationwide lockdowns in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic weighed on the performance of most companies in the first quarter of FY21.

ITC reported 26 percent year-on-year (YoY) fall in standalone net profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2020, at Rs 2,342.76 crore. The company had reported a net profit of Rs 3,173.94 in the same quarter a year ago.

HUL reported a standalone profit of Rs 1,881 crore for the quarter ended June, a growth of 7.2 percent compared to the previous quarter, supported by sharp fall (down 31.4 percent) in advertising and promotion expenses, and strong double-digit growth in foods and refreshment segment.

Marico reported a robust 23.2 percent rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended June 2020 at Rs 388 crore as against Rs 315 crore in the year-ago period

Dabur India reported a net profit of Rs 341.8 crore for the quarter ended June 2020, registering a 5.9 percent YoY dented due to the lockdown disruptions.

India's largest biscuit maker Britannia Industries on July 17 reported a massive 117 percent year-on-year (YoY) increase in consolidated profit for the quarter ended June 2020, driven by strong revenue and operational growth. Profit increased to Rs 545.7 crore during the June quarter 2020, compared to Rs 251.03 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal."

Indian market hit a fresh five-month high on August 11, but experts advise caution at higher levels. The S&P BSE Sensex closed above 38,400 while Nifty50 also climbed 11,300 levels.

Sectorally, the action was seen in metals, banks, finance, and oil & gas space, while profit-taking was visible in telecom, healthcare, and consumer durables.

Experts are of the view that there are no visible signs which suggest that investors should go short but a close below 11,299 can be considered as an initial sign of weakness.

ITC has rallied for the fourth consecutive day in a row and has also witnessed a rise in volumes. The stock has rallied more than 4 percent so far in August. Axis Bank rose on raising Rs 10,000 crore via QIP.

Bank of Baroda share price declined 3 percent in early trade on August 11, a day after the lender reported its June quarter numbers. The bank posted a net loss of Rs 864.3 crore for the June quarter 2020 due to provisioning on standard accounts.

We have collated views of an expert on what investors should do when the market resumes trading on 12 August:

Expert: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

ITC: Fresh buying can be considered on dips with a stop below Rs 190

This counter appears to be in a sideways consolidation phase in a larger range of Rs 210–191 levels and Tuesday’s move also appears to be on the back of decent base which it has built around 191 levels.

However, it appears to be faltering from around the upper end of the said consolidation zone of Rs 210 levels.

Interestingly, this counter is also facing resistance at 189-Day exponential moving average as the scrip encountered selling pressure after testing the said average on multiple occasions in the past including in last Tuesday’s session.

Hence, to strengthen its momentum on the upside it needs a strong close above Rs 210 levels. In that scenario, a decent target of 239 can be expected.

Positional Traders can continue to retain a positive outlook on this counter as long as it sustains above Rs 191 levels. Fresh buying can be considered either on dips with a stop below Rs 190 on a closing basis.

Axis Bank: Traders can look for a target of Rs 470

There seems to be a short-term trading opportunity in this counter as it appears to have registered a breakout on lower time frame charts from an extremely narrow range of 10 points between Rs 437–427 in which it was moving in the preceding three trading sessions before registering the said breakout.

Hence, as long as it sustains above Rs 435 levels a modest target of Rs 470 can be expected but to embark on a medium-term sustainable upmove it needs a close above Rs 485.

For time being traders can remain positive and look for a target of Rs 470 with a stop below Rs 430 on a closing basis.

Bank of Baroda: Fresh buying should be avoided

After retracing 50 percent of its last leg of the rally from the lows of Rs 36–55 levels it appears to be consolidating around Rs 45 levels. However, it is critical for this counter to sustain above the said level as this scrip has been looking weak in the last two trading sessions.

Hence, fresh buying should be avoided but can be considered on a close above Rs 49 for an initial target of Rs 54 whereas traders who are already long shall maintain a tight stop below Rs 45 on a closing basis.

In these challenging times, ITC is focused on enhancing capacity of essential products and collaborations to meet consumer needs. Like several other FMCG companies, ITC developed direct-to-home distribution models like 'ITC on wheels' and partnerships with food aggregators to boost availability of products.

Having launched over 60 new products during FY20 and several more hygiene products during the lockdown, ITC said that its brands represented annual consumer spends of over Rs 19,700 crore. Its packaged food brands like Aashirvaad clocked Rs 6,000 crore in terms of consumer spends. Brands like Sunfeast clocked over Rs 4,000 crore and Bingo clocked Rs 2,700 crore in terms of consumer spends.

However, with the outbreak of COVID-19, ""FMCG industry growth decelerated sharply during the year due to sluggish demand conditions, tight market liquidity and delayed monsoons. Rural growth stood at 0.8 times of urban markets in FY20 compared to 1.4 times in FY19,"" ITC said in its latest annual report.

The company too faced challenges in its education and stationery products businesses as it coincided with the peak season.

The revival of growth momentum in the FMCG industry is dependent on restoration of normalcy and improvement in consumer sentiment.

While essential items, health and hygiene related products are expected to sustain the recent buoyancy in demand, out-of-home consumption categories are likely to experience a more gradual recovery, said ITC.

Persistent weakness in the demand environment coupled with growth in illicit cigarette trade weighed on performance of the cigarettes business.

All cigarette manufacturing facilities as well as the contract-manufacturers of cigarettes had to shut down operations during the last week of March 2020. However, ITC said that all factories are now operational. The hotels business too faced severe challenges owing to drop in tourism amid the Coronavirus outbreak.

Going forward there are a large number of challenges that the economy continues to face. ""There is heightened uncertainty around the timing and shape of the recovery trajectory. The Indian economy is expected to face multi-dimensional challenges like health crises, job losses, labour force displacement, lower productivity,"" said ITC

There is also likely to be pressure on spending and this could weigh on consumption expenditure in the short to medium-term. ""Further measures may be warranted going forward to improve demand, drive consumption and revive the Indian economy,"" ITC said."
"July 28, 2020 08:26 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/fmcg-companies-go-digital-will-the-distributor-be-latest-victim-of-coronavirus-5608851.html,"The coronavirus pandemic and lockdown have changed the way fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies make their products available to consumers.

With the lockdown disrupting supply chains, these companies are revisiting their distribution strategy, with most firms taking the digital route and some planning to do away with distributors.

Early this month, Tata Consumer Products, one of the country’s biggest FMCG firms, sent notices to Tata Tea and Tata Salt distributors, terminating their agreements, giving them a month to wind up the business.

“We have a lot of tie-ups to ensure that the online availability of Tata Consumer Products portfolio is widely available,” chairman N Chandrasekaran told shareholders during the company’s virtual annual general meeting in early July.

Many tie-ups were done and more were in the works. “There is a Tata digital platform being launched later this year and Tata Consumer Products will be also available on the Tata product platforms,” Chandrasekaran said.

Tata Consumer Products, formed by the merger of Tata Global Beverages and the food business of Tata Chemicals in 2019, is estimated to have about 40-50 distributors who supply goods to stockists and dealers.

Other FMCG companies such as Marico, ITC, Godrej Consumer Products and HUL, too, are going digital in a big way as coronavirus outbreak forces millions of Indians to seek the safety of their homes.

Who is a distributor?

A distributor—also referred to as a dealer or a wholesale dealer— is the key link in a supply chain. A generally accepted definition of the distributor is a person or a firm that connects a manufacturer or a marketing company to retailers.

A distributor purchases in bulk from a manufacturer and re-distributes the product in smaller quantities among retailers, who then sell it to consumers.

The distributor takes orders from retailers and institutions and ensures timely delivery of products while maintaining a stock as a cushion against supply fluctuations.

It is through distribution channels that a product travels from manufacturers to consumers.

Why shun distributors?

Tata Consumer Products wants to be efficient and scale up business through digitisation, which will allow it to directly deal with stockists and dealers, eliminating the need for a distributor.

Companies such as Marico, HUL and Godrej Consumer Products are not planning to do away with distributors as of now but are strengthening their digital presence.

According to analysts, the distribution channel margin and expenses incurred in managing them form a substantial part of a company’s marketing costs.

Lack of manpower and restrictions on the movement of people and goods during the lockdown have played havoc with supply chains. Wiser from the experience, FMCG companies are using the direct route to reach consumers even though restrictions are being eased.

“To reach consumers faster, FMCG companies are going to direct source such as digital. It also saves the cost of the middleman,” said an FMCG analyst with a brokerage house on condition of anonymity.

Why go digital?

“We brought digital to the forefront to ensure business continuity, and liaise with our customers and partners across the country who were restricted by various degrees of the lockdown,”said Manish Anandani, Vice President – Customer Development & Professional, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Health India.

“Also, a conscious effort to pivot towards digital capabilities was made so that our customers and consumer connect does not drop. Looking ahead in times of the pandemic, to be able to execute an evolved Customer Strategy for the last mile delivery will remain a priority as always. Having added more customers and digital channels, exploring direct-to-consumer models, and introducing mobile-enabled capabilities to ramp up retailing, we expect these changes to build resilience in our supply chain moving forward. We aim to continue our agile ways of working to effectively respond to the various degrees of demand across segments,” he added.

The outbreak has made consumers cautious and social distancing will be the new normal, say experts. They are increasingly taking the digital route for their daily needs, conserving cash and making payments.

According to a Deloitte Global Survey, Indian consumers prefer digital over physical modes for shopping. “The online channel remains the top choice as consumers intend to use it to procure products ( essentials as well as select discretionary),” the report said.

Consumers prefer online shopping for everyday essentials such as groceries (55 percent) household (49 percent) and medicines (44 percent).

“COVID-19 has shifted the focus of Indian consumers towards an online digital experience even as organisations are redefining their business operations to make the last-mile delivery seamless and by ensuring safety and hygiene to meet new expectations of consumers,” Porus Doctor, Partner and Leader, Consumer Industry, Deloitte India, said.

Consumer-facing companies were adopting automation to better manage their stocks by reducing congestion in stores and restocking efficiently, he said.

“Using online channels, consumer expectations for seamless shopping experience are poised to grow and companies are fast catching up with this eventuality,” Doctor added.

Why the tie-ups?

Tata Consumer Products has strengthened its direct distribution model by partnering with food-delivery startup Zomato and pizza chain Domino’s Pizza.

In April, the company said its distributors would list as marketplace sellers on Flipkart.

The partnership allows consumers to buy combo packs of essentials such as beverages (Tata Tea and coffee) and food items (Tata Sampann range of spices, pulses, and nutri mixes) offered by Tata Consumer Products on the ecommerce platform.

FMCG companies are faced with a peculiar problem. There has been a surge in demand for essentials due to the lockdown but distribution and transporting of goods have been hit hard.

Not just Tata Consumer, other companies, too, have bolstered their online presence, especially for delivering essentials.

Marico Ltd has partnered rival online food-delivery firms Swiggy and Zomato to launch Saffola Store.

Market experts say these tie-ups are a win-win for both sides. For instance, Zomato and Swigggy, which have seen food orders drop during the outbreak, can put their delivery fleet to a better use and Marico gets its good delivered at customers’ doorsteps.

Kolkata-based ITC tapped a range of distribution channels to ensure supply of essential goods and hygiene products to its consumers during the lockdown.

While announcing its results, the FMCG major said it had come up with new delivery models. It had launched a website, ITC Store, and also ITC on Wheels to take products directly to housing complexes.

The company has also joined hands with Domino’s, Zomato and direct-selling company Amway for home delivering a range of food products and beverages (Aashirvaad, Yippee! and Sunfeast B Natural), and hygiene and personal care products that it sells under Savlon and Fiama brands.

Packaged consumer goods company, Dabur, too, has tied up with Swiggy and hyperlocal delivery startup Dunzo. Emami has partnered Swiggy and Zomato.

Coroanvirus is redefining consumption and consumer behaviour and FMCG companies have to be tuned in to these changes.

According to a Nielsen report, the contribution of e-commerce to FMCG sales in India is at 2 percent and is expected to grow to 5 percent by 2022.

It is for this 5 percent and more that FMCG companies are going digital as well as hyperlocal."

Motilal Oswal 's research report on ITC

ITC reported higher-than-expected sales growth (mainly due to better-than-expected agriculture business resilience) in 1QFY21. However, EBITDA and PAT were disappointing due to (a) estimated 37% cigarette volume decline, (b) far lower contribution of the highly profitable cigarette business to total sales (32% in 1QFY21 v/s usual levels of ~40%), and (c) massive losses in the hospitality business (~8% negative impact on EBITDA in 1QFY21 v/s 1% usual positive contribution). Our channel checks indicate that cigarette volumes are close to pre-COVID levels. However, re-imposition of lockdowns in a few states could have some negative effect. Nevertheless, it is unlikely for the (a) weak mix in 1QFY21 (low cigarette proportion to total sales) to be repeated, and (b) impact on margins to be as sharp as in 1QFY21.

Outlook

Further, outlook for the hotel business is still extremely hazy, which should lead to some profitability impact. Target multiple of 15x Jun’22E EPS is at ~30% premium to global tobacco majors. We maintain Neutral on the stock.

HDFC Securities' research report on ITC

ITC’s 1QFY21 beat revenue expectations as the company clocked 17% YoY decline vs the estimated decline of 28% YoY. Cigarette (adjusted for excise duty on inventory) net revenue/EBIT declined by 35/39% YoY with a volume dip of 35% YoY. The company saw sequential improvement in cigarette revenue with marginal sales in April, 30-35% YoY decline in May and a strong recovery in June. However, the last 10 days have been challenging due to the return of lockdowns. FMCG showed strong momentum as the company saw a comparable growth of 12% YoY, with 34% YoY growth in staples, convenience foods and health & hygiene (75% of the portfolio). The growth was led by packaged foods (biscuits, atta, and noodles) and hygiene products. We expect the FMCG momentum to sustain, at a slightly lower growth rate.

Outlook

We maintain our EPS estimate for FY21/FY22/FY23 as we expect a recovery in the company 2HFY21 onwards. We value ITC on SoTP and arrive at a target price of Rs 236 (implied P/E of 18x P/E Jun-22E EPS). Maintain BUY.

ICICI Direct's research report on ITC

ITC reported 17.4% decline in sales with cigarettes revenues seeing de-growth of 29.1%. The volume dip of 40% was better than our expectation given 45 days business loss. We believe trade (distributor, retailers) inventory would have depleted during lockdown despite retail shops staying closed. Preferred pack buying over loose cigarettes also helped restore volumes. These factors would have helped company to re-fill trade pipeline given manufacturing & supply chain operations normalised in June. The trade normally holds 14 days inventory. Comparable FMCG sales grew 12.2% with strong demand in staples, packages foods & hygiene product and steep decline in discretionary & stationary businesses. Operating margins contracted 1184 bps mainly impacted by negative operating leverage & excise hike earlier in budget. Net profit de-grew 26.2%.

Outlook

With the end of capex cycle in most businesses (except FMCG), we believe capital allocation has been rationalised. With more than Rs 20,000 crore of cash & liquid investment and consistent free cash flow generation of Rs 10,000-12000 crore, we expect Rs 20/share including special dividend in FY21E. We value the stock on SOTP basis valuing cigarette business at 14x PE & FMCG business at 5x price to sales with a target price of Rs 250/share.

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

ICICI Bank posted good numbers for Q1FY2021, where operating performance was better than expectations, even though higher provisions (partly due to COVID-19) resulted in lower-than-expected PAT. Moratorium book stood at 17.5% (from 30% at Q4FY2020) which is positive. Asset quality improves with GNPA/NNPA ratio decreasing by 5 bps/18 bps, respectively, to 5.99%/1.23% vis-à-vis Q4FY2020. Even gross slippages declined significantly to Rs. 1,160 crore, which was a 20-quarter low.

Outlook

The bank is adequately capitalised (Tier-1 at 14.9%) and a successful equity-raising plan will further add to balance sheet strength. We like the prudent and cautious approach of the bank in building provision buffers, cautious loan book growth, and healthy capitalisation levels. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a revised SOTP-based price target (PT) of Rs. 485.

Dolat Capital's research report on ITC

ITC’s Q1FY21 revenue, EBITDA and APAT were below our estimates. The cigarette business posted ~29% YoY de-growth, vs our estimate of 25% decline. A 970bps decline in margin in the cigarette business indicates that the product mix was unfavorable and economy brand contribution must have increased during the quarter. Significant increase in duty has resulted in widening of price gap between ITC and smuggled cigarettes. We believe that this would continue to pressurize volume growth even after lockdown re-opens. FMCG business exhibited satisfactory performance with 10% revenue increase and 120bps margin expansion. We have lowered our FY21E and FY22E EPS estimates to Rs 10.6 and Rs 12.0 to factor in Q1 performance and extension in lockdown.



Outlook

Though the stock is trading at a steep discount to other FMCG peers, we believe that the stock would remain under pressure. Consequently, we maintain Reduce with TP of Rs 213.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC PAT beat has been led by better than expected performance in Cigarettes, Agri and Paperboard business and 44% growth in other income. FMCG story remains intact with 34% sales growth and 170bps margin expansion led by segments like Atta, Biscuits, Noodles, Dairy and Hygiene products. Cigarette business is expected to report improved nos as June exit sale show recovery close to Pre Covid sales. Hotels business is expected to remain under significant pressure in near term with poor chance of being in black for next 1-2 quarters. We believe ITC would be one of the key beneficiary of an uptick in consumer demand and is inching towards double digit EBIDTA margins in FMCG business over next 2-3 years. ITC trades at 14.0x Sept22 EPS, ~60% discount to our coverage universe with 5% dividend yield (80% payout) and 7.1% PBT CAGR over FY20-23.



Outlook

Maintain BUY with target price of Rs262 on SOTP (valuing cigarette business at 15xSept EPS, 58% of SOTP value). Significant re-rating depends upon reduced aversion to tobacco stocks globally and clarity on SUTI stake sale.

Emkay Global Financial's report on ITC

We believe ITC can surprise on FMCG margins which may reach close to double-digits in FY21, with EBIT almost doubling. We increase ITC’s FY21-23E earnings by ~3%, driven by increase in FMCG margin assumptions to 10-11% from a conservative 7-7.5% earlier. The performance of foods businesses of BRIT and HUL and our channel checks indicate strong traction for ITÇ’s foods division (85% of FMCG), which can offset the weakness in the non-essential portfolio and drive healthy growth. Low ad spends, benign input prices and scale efficiencies can potentially drive a jump in margins, similar to BRIT. Cigarettes remain the key earnings driver, and higher pace of recovery in cigarettes should improve growth visibility. The recovery in ITC’s cigarette business seems to be faster than peers, indicating market share gains, which can be a key positive.

Outlook

Excluding the value of other segments, the cigarette division is trading at 11x earnings (see Exhibit 11), in line with global peers despite the higher growth potential. We value ITC at 18x Sept-22E EPS and increase TP to Rs255 from Rs240. Faster recovery in cigarettes and strong profitability in FMCG can drive re-rating. Maintain Buy/OW in EAP.

Brokerages and analysts are expecting the FMCG major ITC to feel the heat of COVID-19 led economic disruption.

ITC will release its June quarter scorecard of the financial year 2021 on July 24.

Brokerages are of the view that any update on COVID-19 lockdown and further price hike in cigarettes, update on share loss in capsule cigarettes and demand outlook for ‘Other-FMCG’ business will be in focus when the company releases the earning numbers.

Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 25.5 percent fall in net sales and a 37.7 percent fall in adjusted PAT on a year-on-year (YoY) basis ITC's Q1.

Kotak said lockdown impacted sales for the first 40 days of the quarter. However, volumes bounced back quickly to near-normal levels thereafter.

About 85 percent of ITC's FMCG portfolio comprises essential categories that reported healthy growth offsetting decline in the rest of the portfolio.

""We model about 53 percent YoY decline in cigarette net sales, led by a 55 percent decline in volumes and 2 percent price/mix (price increase of about 8 percent partly offset by down-trading). We forecast 50 percent YoY decline in cigarette EBIT,"" Kotak said.

""We model 3 percent growth and 80 percent YoY decline in FMCG and hotels segment, respectively, due to COVID-19. We expect margin expansion in FMCG (up 80 bps YoY to 3.3 percent PBIT margin) and operating loss in hotel segments,"" Kotak said.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services expects a 27.5 percent YoY fall in the company's net sales for the June quarter of FY21.

Adjusted PAT of ITC may see a 21.4 percent YoY fall in Q1FY21, while the margin percentage may come at 63.9 in Q1FY21 against 64 in Q1FY20, estimates of Motilal Oswal show.

Motilal expects cigarette volume decline of 35 percent and EBIT decline of 33 percent YoY.

As per the estimates of brokerage firm Sharekhan by BNP PARIBAS, ITC may report a decline of 50 percent in cigarette sales volume in Q1.

FMCG business, Sharekhan expects, will deliver double-digit growth due to strong demand for atta, noodles and biscuits.

The brokerage highlighted that the hotel business was a complete wash-out during Q1 while cigarette sales were strictly not allowed for the first 45 days of the quarter.

For ITC's Q1, Sharekhan expects a 27.7 percent fall in sales, 33.7 percent fall in adjusted PAT and 852 bps fall in margins on YoY basis.

Brokerage firm ICICI Direct expects ITC to post a 25.6 percent decline in sales given the company lost 40-45 days of cigarette sales.

""Operating margins are likely to witness significant contraction due to negative operating leverage. We expect earnings to decline 33.7 percent,"" said ICICI Direct.

ICICI expects a 50 percent dip in cigarette volumes during the quarter. The company had taken about a 10 percent price hike after excise duty increase in Budget 2020.

ICICI expects a 30 percent decline in agri and paper business revenues with supply chain remaining disrupted in April and May.

Hotels business was the worst hit with occupancy dropping to single digits. ICICI expects an 80 percent decline in sales in this segment in a near washout situation.

The brokerage highlights that FMCG business would have been silver lining given most categories like atta, biscuits, packaged foods, soaps and sanitisers are part of the essentials and started manufacturing within 10-15 days of lockdown.

Demand for packaged foods increased significantly, given increased in-home consumption, ICICI Direct said.

Net Sales are expected to decrease by 27.2 percent Y-o-Y (down 26.6 percent Q-o-Q) to Rs. 8,380 crore, according to HDFC Securities.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) are likely to fall by 33 percent Y-o-Y (down 26.5 percent Q-o-Q) to Rs. 3,060 crore.

Share price of cigarette major ITC rose 4 percent in the early trade on June 29 after the company posted its March quarter numbers.

The company on June 26 reported a standalone profit of Rs 3,797 crore for the quarter ended March, a year-on-year growth of 6.5 percent.

Revenue from operations fell 6.4 percent YoY to Rs 11,420 crore due to nationwide lockdown for more than a week in March. Revenue (excluding excise duty) dropped 9.6 percent to Rs 10,842.2 crore.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell 8.9 percent to Rs 4,163.5 crore.

Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 240

Company's Cigarette volumes declined by 10 percent YoY, while packaged foods reported mid-single-digit growth.

The Cigarette business is on course to hit near pre-COVID levels. The Q1FY21 would be a washout, however company's dividend yield of 5% makes it attractive, reported CNBC-TV18.

Macquarie | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 232

The recovery in cigarette volume has been strong with June run-rate of cigarette volume at 85-90% pre-COVID-19 levels. Its FMCG business can be an outperformer amongst its peers in FY21.

There is a significant increase in dividend payout to 80%, while dividend yield is now > 5 percent, reported CNBC-TV18.

CLSA | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 220

The near-term looks tough. Its dividend payout increased to 88% in FY20 and earnings estimates see minor cuts in FY21-22, reported CNBC-TV18.

Motilal Oswal| Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 190

ITC’s 4QFY20 results were lower than expectations. While our checks suggest that cigarette volumes have returned to near-normalcy now, the possibility of further GST increase is fairly high over the next few months.

We maintain neutral on account of (a) ITC’s overall profitability being highly dependent on cigarettes (which is likely to continue), and (b) risk to the already weak earnings growth projections over FY20-22E due to overhang of the GST increase.

Prabhudas Lilladher| Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 251

We believe ITC would be one of the key beneficiaries of an uptick in FMCG demand and is inching towards double-digit EBIDTA margins over the next 2-3 years.

We believe cigarette business has picked up well and might achieve exit volumes equal to pre-COVID levels, despite a 9% price increase in Feb. We expect tepid recovery in Hotels business for the next couple of quarters with losses in 1H due to low occupancy and higher fixed cost business.

ICICIdirect | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 250

With the increasing scale & margins of FMCG business, we believe it is likely to be valued close to peers in the industry. We value the stock on SOTP based method valuing cigarette business at 12x PE & FMCG business at 5x price to sales with a target price of Rs 250 per share.

Motilal Oswal 's research report on ITC

ITC’s 4QFY20 results were lower than expectations. While our checks suggest that cigarette volumes have returned to near-normalcy now, the possibility of further GST increase is fairly high over the next few months. While valuations appear inexpensive at 15.1x FY22E EPS, the narrative on ITC has changed over the past year with ESG concerns over cigarettes increasing worldwide. Consequently, global tobacco peers have witnessed sharp contraction in their multiples. For ITC, 85% of EBIT came from cigarettes in FY20. We maintain Neutral on account of (a) ITC’s overall profitability being highly dependent on cigarettes (which is likely to continue), and (b) risk to the already weak earnings growth projections over FY20-22E due to overhang of the GST increase.



Outlook

The stock is trading at 15.1x FY22 EPS. We value ITC at 14x Jun’22 EPS (20% premium to global peers average multiple) to arrive at TP of INR190. Maintain Neutral.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC’s 4Q20 cigarette volume decline of 11% disappointed whereas 160bps margin expansion for FY20 in FMCG business was a big positive. Although 1Q is likely to show significant pressure due to washout in April across Cigarettes and Hotels business, expect high teens growth in FMCG due to strong traction in Biscuits, Atta, Noodles and personal hygiene products. We believe cigarette business has picked up well and might achieve exit volumes equal to pre Covid levels, despite 9% price increase in Feb. We expect tepid recovery in Hotels business for next couple of quarters with losses in 1H due to low occupancy and higher fixed cost business.



Outlook

We believe ITC would be one of the key beneficiary of an uptick in FMCG demand and is inching towards double digit EBIDTA margins over next 2-3 years. ITC trades at 14.4xFY22 EPS, ~60% discount to our coverage universe with 5% dividend yield (80% payout) and 8.9% PBT CAGR over FY20-22.

Revenues fell 6.4% (net of excise dip of 9.6%) impacted by supply chain & manufacturing disruption. Operating profit also declined 8.9%.

Cigarette-FMCG-to-hotel major ITC is likely to report moderate growth in profit due to lower tax cost, but lower volumes in cigarette business could hit revenue during the quarter-ended March 2020. The company will announce its quarterly earnings on June 26.

Cigarette business is likely to be impacted by hike in excise duty and COVID-19-led nationwide lockdown during the quarter. Hence, brokerages expect 5-6 percent decline in volumes, though realisation may be higher due to price hike.

In case of FMCG segment, brokerages see around 5 percent revenue growth following demand for essential goods like foods and hygiene products, hence there could be margin expansion during the quarter. However, other segments are expected to get impacted by lockdown for more than a week in March.

""We model a 0.4 percent YoY decline in cigarette sales led by 5 percent decline in volumes and about 4.5 percent improvement in realizations. We forecast a 1 percent YoY decline in cigarette EBIT,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities which sees 4.3 percent fall in revenue and 6.1 percent growth in profit for the quarter YoY.

The brokerage further expects 2 percent and 23 percent YoY decline in FMCG and Hotels segment due to COVID-19. ""We expect margin expansion in FMCG (up 60 bps YoY to 4.6 percent PBIT margin) and a sharp decline in the PBIT margin of Hotels segments to 6.6 percent from 17.4 percent.""

Narnolia also feels other FMCG segment is expected to report moderate revenue growth of 5 percent YoY considering the segment to be a part of essential services that will be continue to serve the consumers under this outbreak.

Bayer CropScience on Monday said it has partnered with agri business division of ITC to extend the reach of its crop protection products through ITC's e-Choupal 4.0 platform. The partnership has commenced as a pilot project in Mysore in Karnataka and will gradually be expanded to other geographies across India, Bayer said in a statement.

With COVID-19 disrupting farming operations and on-farm advisory, this initiative will help farmers avail agri-inputs and digital advisory on a timely basis, it added.

ITC and Bayer are jointly training and on-boarding retailers in Mysore, to cater to farmers' orders placed through the e-Choupal 4.0 platform.

Field Officers from both companies have also received extensive training on product knowledge and technical advisory to support farmers.

Over 42,000 ITC farmers, covering 60,000 hectares across 1,100 villages in Mysore region would be benefitted from this partnership.

Farmers can place their order for Bayer products through the e-Choupal 4.0 platform and track their orders. Those without access to smartphones can place their orders online with assistance from Bayer and ITC's field staff. Offline orders can also be placed.

“Farmers in India often struggle to get access to agri-inputs, training and advisory under one roof. Lack of modern technologies and good agricultural practices hamper crop productivity and profitability. At Bayer, we are looking at collaborations to create greater value for farmers and the entire agri eco-system,"" Bayer CropScience CEO and MD D Narain said.

Bayer's partnership with ITC aims to offer tailored solutions, enabling farmers to achieve better harvests and progress to sustainable agriculture, Narain added.

Sanjiv Rangrass of ITC, who has been driving the e-Choupal 4.0 initiative, said: ""This collaboration with Bayer will enable access to quality inputs by digitalizing the local marketplace eco-system for farmers. This will leverage Bayer's expertise in agri-inputs and ITC's deep-rooted linkages with farmers through the e-Choupal 4.0 platform, thereby creating value and a brand of trust for the farmers.”

A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Swiggy COO Vivek Sunder said: ""Through our partnership with ITC Hotels, customers can now indulge in curated gourmet dishes from popular restaurants of the ITC Hotels chain across India through the Swiggy app. We look forward to creating unique dining experiences for customers while helping them celebrate special occasions at the comfort of their homes.""

Earlier other luxury star hotels such as Marriott, Hilton have piggybacked on food ordering and delivery platforms such as Zomato, Swiggy to reach customers during the lockdown and the people are expected to avoid crowded places as restaurants in the initial phases.

""It may be recalled that ITC Hotels had tapped into the food and beverage take-away model across the country recently and received overwhelming feedback from diners for the ""Flavours"" takeaway (and home delivery) dining experience. The association with Swiggy endeavours to reach a much larger customer base,"" said ITC Hotels.

In the next few months, more such products would be jointly introduced by the companies in the market.

""Many new products, particularly based upon the requirements and expectations of the consumers and you will see them over the next couple of months,"" ITC Divisional Chief Executive (Foods Division) Hemant Malik said.

ITC is sensing a good potential in the health and immunity-boosting space during the pandemic.

""In the month of April and May, when heat is there, people are looking for beverages and I believe that there is a likelihood of shift that would happen from carbonated soft drinks towards fruit juice beverages,"" said Malik adding that it is a much larger market many times. ""So, even if the shift is a small shift, it's a large shift as far as the packaged beverages are concerned.""

Last month, ITC partnered Domino's Pizza, Swiggy and Zomato to deliver groceries and packaged foods to the customers during the lockdown at their door steps.

While commenting on its partnership with Amway, Malik said, ""We had been in conversation for this partnership for some time. With consumers increasingly looking at products that offer them nutrition and immunity-boosting value proposition, we fast-tracked the launch of 'B Natural+' range.

According to Malik, this collaboration is a reflection of synergies of the two companies and teams jointly will work closely on various programmes in the area of health and wellness.

""Other products in the health and wellness space are also in the pipeline that will be launching through this partnership in the coming months,"" he said

While Amway India CEO Anshu Budhraja said, ""We are pleased to share that both the companies are coming together to create products in health, wellness and immunity space to address the anticipated demand in the future.""

Budhraja said it is a first-ever move in the history of Amway, and the company continues to innovate and create opportunities to deliver value to consumers and this is just the beginning.

According to him, this will help in expanding Amway's business, which is already in the vitamins, minerals and supplements segment and, now, a range of beverages.

The new 'B Natural+' range of beverages, which ITC claims it to have clinically proven ingredient to support immunity, will be available in two variants – Orange and Mixed Fruit.

Currently, the Indian packaged juices and fruit-based beverages are estimated to be around Rs 2,500 crore in market size."

The cigarette-to-hotel-to-FMCG conglomerate ITC has been evaluating food trends during the lockdown and plans to launch new products in the next couple of months.

“We are evaluating products which consumers are demanding during the lockdown. We have noticed a few trends. Over the next couple of months we will launch all of those,” said Hemant Malik, Divisional Chief Executive − Foods Division, ITC without sharing any specific details.

He was speaking at a virtual conference organised to launch B Natural+ fruit beverage in partnership with Amway.

Malik pointed out that given the coronavirus pandemic consumers are looking for immunity boosting products and hence, ITC launched B Natural + range which is expected to provide immunity through fruit and fibre.

The beverage, B Natural +, available in two flavours—Orange and Mixed Fruit priced at Rs 130 for one litre has been developed by ITC’s Life Sciences & Technology Centre.

“During these trying times, immunity has emerged as a key focus area. This Clinically proven Ingredient was tested in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study conducted over a period of 3 months keeping in mind all the guidelines by ICMR and the study is registered in CTRI,” Malik stated.

The new B Natural + range will be available in two variants.

As a strategic partner in the space of health and immunity, Amway India is expected to further accelerate reach to the consumers.

Subsequently, the new range will also be available nationally across modern trade format, general trade stores and e-commerce websites, through ITC’s PAN-India distribution network.

Going forward more such tie-ups are in the pipeline, he said.

Malik expects consumers to shift from carbonated drinks to fruit juices due to health factors.

He also said during the lockdown the company has witnessed immense demand for its packaged food brands such as Aashirvaad, Yippee! Noodles, Sunfeast and B Natural.

The Kolkata-based conglomerate reported a net profit of Rs 4,141.93 crore for the December quarter, on gross revenue of Rs 11,912.16 crore.

The company is yet to announce results for January-March FY20.

According to analysts, supply chain disruptions are likely to hit the profitability of ITC.

The company launched multiple initiatives to participate in India's fight against coronavirus by tapping a range of distribution channels to ensure that supplies of essential food and hygiene products are delivered at the doorstep of its consumers during lockdown period.

It joined hands with Domino's to deliver ITC’s essential items and partnered with food delivery chains Swiggy, Zomato along with community-centric apps such as Apna Complex, My gate, No broker and Azgo.

Through such tie-ups, ITC ensured home deliveries of its brands like Aashirvaad, Yippee!, Sunfeast B Natural.

Recently, the ITC had entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire Kolkata-based packaged spice maker Sunrise Foods as the firm looks to bolster its food business and battle rivals Hindustan Unilever, Pepsico and Britannia.

ITC has been looking to tilt the revenue mix from its mainstay tobacco to FMCG across categories."

ICICI Direct's research report on ITC

ITC has acquired a 100% stake in Kolkata based Sunrise Food Pvt Ltd. The company is in the business of basic & blended spices and mustard oil with the brand name ‘Sunrise’. Though we do not know the sales of the acquired company and the deal size, various media reports suggest Sunrise brand has a ~Rs 1000 crore sales in FY20 while the deal size is ~Rs 1800-2000 crore. The company is largely present in eastern India and operates through four factories in Agra, Bikaner, Jaipur and Kolkata. ITC is also present in spices business under Aashirvaad brand and is a leader in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh markets. The acquisition will help increase penetration of the Sunrise brand across the country while leveraging ITC’s wide distribution network. The acquisition is part of ITC’s strategy to increase its FMCG business to Rs 1 lakh crore (FY19 sales Rs 12500 crore) sales by 2030. We believe pulses & spices categories are large and completely dominated by unbranded or semi branded products, which presents a big opportunity to shift consumer demand towards packaged food, specifically in current circumstances where consumers would be increasingly preferring packaged/branded food products over loose/semi branded ones.



Outlook

Though, ITC is likely to be adversely impacted by lockdown in FY21, there are multiple factors that can impact cigarette business for the next two to three years that are (1) unavailability of smuggled cigarette even post lockdown period, (2) possibility of heavy tax on non-cigarette tobacco products & (3) increase in sales due to increase in prices after excise hike. Moreover, we believe margins in FMCG business can easily reach double digit in next two to three years. We expect ITC to declare dividend of Rs 16/ share (company declared dividend policy of ~80% payout) along with special dividend this year. The stock is currently trading at attractive multiples of 13.6x FY22E earnings. We value on SOTP basis valuing cigarettes business at 15x FY22 earnings, FMCG segment at 5X FY22E sales. We continue to maintain BUY rating on ITC with a target price of Rs 230/share.

ITC share price added nearly 5 percent in early trade on May 26 after the company said it is going to acquire 100 percent stake in Sunrise Foods.

ITC has entered into a share purchase agreement (SPA) on May 23, 2020 to acquire 100 percent of the equity share capital of Sunrise Foods Private Limited (SFPL), a company primarily engaged in the business of spices under the trademark ‘Sunrise’, subject to fulfilment of various terms and conditions as specified in the SPA, as per company release.

The proposed acquisition will augment the company’s product portfolio and is aligned to ITC’s aspiration to significantly scale up its Spices business and expand its footprint across the country, it added.

Credit Suisse has maintained neutral call with a target at Rs 190 per share.

According to Credit Suisse, the Sunrise acquisition is an excellent fit for ITC's strengths and it is likely to be the largest FMCG purchase done by company.

Sunrise will give company strength in East India in spices, it added.

Most FMCG companies plan to continue the partnership even after the lockdown.

At a time when, stepping out has become risk for consumers due to risk of COVID-19, FMCG companies are entering in to tie ups to enable door-step delivery to consumers.

With supply chain concerns, and acute shortage of manpower, last mile delivery was becoming challenging for companies, particularly when there was high demand of essentials. This affected the sales of FMCG companies.

Marico, while declaring its Q4FY20 results, said their turnover from domestic business declined 8 percent YoY to Rs 1,146 crore due to lockdown.

The India business recorded a volume decline of 3 per cent, vastly affected by disruptions in the last fortnight of March, due to lockdowns initially enforced in some states and eventually all over the country, to contain the spread of coronavirus in India, Marico said in its release sent to the exchanges.

""Partnering with food delivery apps was the best thing FMCG companies could do. It is serving the purpose of delivering at the same time supply chain issue is resolved as delivery apps are directly picking up products from the distribution centres and shops, and getting them delivered to the consumer,"" said an analyst who closely tracks ITC, GCPL and Marico.

Market experts also pointed out that tie ups are a win-win for both the entities. For instance, Zomato gets the business if it has tied up with Marico and Marico is able to sell its products at the customer's door step.

Going forward, these tie ups will help FMCG companies improve their sales to an extent, and also help them to ride on the success of the on e-commerce as a channel.

According to a Nielsen report, contribution of e-commerce’s to overall FMCG sales in the country is at 2 percent currently and is expected to increase to 5 percent by 2022.

The investments in farm-gate infrastructure would help to reduce food wastage in the country and also ensure availability of quality local produce for food processing companies, besides generating employment.

""It is heartening to see the reforms announced for the agri sector that provides livelihoods to about half of India's workforce. Amendments to the ECA (Essential Commodities Act), reforms in agri marketing and risk mitigation through predictable prices will empower farmers, strengthen agri-food processing linkages and enable demand-driven value added agriculture,"" ITC Chairman Sanjiv Puri said in a statement.

He further said, ""The reforms will encourage investments in food processing and together with the infrastructure outlays will contribute in shaping a competitive agri value chain, reduce wastages and raise farmer incomes.”

Echoing views, home-grown FMCG firm Dabur said the support is aimed at empowering farmers and driving long-term growth through creation of infrastructure to support the agri-industry.

“The investments in farm-gate infrastructure would go a long way in reducing food wastage in the country and also ensure availability of quality local produce for food processing companies, besides generating employment,” Dabur India CEO Mohit Malhotra said.

Promoting cultivation of medicinal plants is a big positive and will help the ayurvedic products and medicines manufacturers by ensuring availability of key raw material, he added

“Encouraging more farmers to enter this field will ensure a steady increase in the population of native herbs, besides boosting farmer income. The formation of Beekeeping Infrastructure Development Fund is another step in the right direction,” Malhotra added.

Announcing the third tranche of an overall package of Rs 20 lakh crore to deal with the economic fallout of COVID-19 pandemic, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday announced a Rs 1 lakh crore Agri Infrastructure Fund that will finance projects at farm-gate and aggregation point for efficient post-harvest management of crops.

Besides, schemes for micro food enterprises, cattle vaccination, dairy sector, herbal plantation, beekeeping, and fruits and vegetables were also announced.

Sitharaman also announced Rs 10,000 crore fund to support 2 lakh micro food enterprises (MFEs) for promoting health and wellness, herbal, organic and nutritional products.

The government will also launch a Rs 20,000 crore Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana for the development of marine and inland fisheries.

Indian consumer goods giant ITC has warned some workers of disciplinary action and pay cuts for missing work during the coronavirus epidemic, leading to a showdown with at least two unions, according to letters from both sides seen by Reuters.

The workforce problems at two ITC food plants - one in Pune in Maharashtra and another in Karnataka - show how labour issues weigh on Indian firms after a nationwide coronavirus lockdown forced thousands of workers to go back to their villages.

ITC is one of India's top consumer goods company, earning $11 billion in annual sales and manufacturing staples such as flour, noodles and biscuits. It is also India's top cigarette maker.

In notices on April 29 to employees of at least two food factories, ITC said the attendance of some workers in April was irregular while some had not reported at all, even though factories were open as food items are classified as essentials during the lockdown.

While ITC had not taken any action against such workers, the ""absence without leave"" would lead to cuts in salaries and ""disciplinary action"", the company said in its notice without elaborating on any measures it could take.

The ITC Foods Employees Union in Pune wrote a letter to the company condemning the move, pointing out that many workers were back in their villages or staying in areas still under lockdown.

While ITC in its notice said it had taken adequate safety measures, the union said some workers were travelling in unsafe conditions without masks and social distancing.

""You are forcing more workers to report to duty which may put us all in danger,"" the union said in its letter, dated April 30, and seen by Reuters.

ITC said in a statement it had seen ""tremendous co-operation"" by workers to meet the demand of essential goods, and it had taken adequate safety measures at its factories.

The Kolkata-based firm, which has a total of around 120 manufacturing units, including third-party owned, said 70-80 of them are currently functioning with capacity utilisation ranging between 20-60 per cent.

Speaking to reporters through a video conference, ITC Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said the coronavirus pandemic will have a significant impact on the economy as well as on the company in the first quarter of the current fiscal, but it is difficult to make a business forecast at the moment.

""What would be helpful there is that some clarity on where manufacturing can be allowed. There are some definitions that are being put, but the reality is that most of the manufacturing units are in the perimeters of urban centres. Those need to be allowed (to function),"" he said.

Puri was responding to a query about what more steps are required from the government for industries for hassle-free resumption of manufacturing activities during the lockdown.

He further said, ""Even when we allow all industries that are located at the perimeters of urban centres, provided they are outside containment zones, when they operate, it will take a long time for capacity to build up to a reasonable level.""

This is because ""sometime you may find that the odd vendor is in a containment zone or sometimes you may find that your factory is outside containment zone, but all of your employees are in containment zones"", he added.

Puri also stressed on the need for allowing entire manufacturing value chain -- from raw material supplies to reaching the end consumers -- to operate to help kickstart economic activity again.

""All the activities where manufacturing has been allowed, it is pretty broadbased. So we have to get the whole value chains to work. Whatever is getting manufactured has to reach the end consumer, otherwise you cannot simply manufacture to create inventory,"" Puri said.

He, however, praised various steps taken by the government in the fight against coronavirus pandemic, saying things could have gone out of control without the ""proactive measures"" .

Commenting on the company's current manufacturing operations, Puri said out of a total of around 120 manufacturing units, which includes third-party units, around ""70 to 80 would be operational"".

""Capacity utilisations are in the region of 20-25 per cent to 50-60 per cent depending on the location. Even within factories that are running, we are right now running lines where we see immediate visibility of demand. We are not running lines where the visibility of demand is not there right now,"" Puri added.

Asked if he also supported various industry bodies' demand for stimulus package from the government, Puri said the government would need to support sectors like MSMEs, travel and tourism industry which generate a lot of employment.

When asked about the impact of the health crisis on the company, he said it is difficult to give a forecast and a lot would depend on how the country's GDP fares in the first quarter.

""Depending on how much of economic activity is revived would really determine the extent of the impact. It appears to be quite substantive in this quarter,"" he said.

The impact is not unique to any specific sector and is broadbased, he said, adding that ""it is not just to do with our verticals, but it is right across the economy. It is not unique to any specific sector. Whatever is running, is running at a low capacity and lot of areas and activities are almost or at complete standstill. From that perspective it is not good news"".

Puri, however, said the health crisis has also brought new opportunities which the company will tap going ahead, including ""evaluating acquisitions"" at the right time.

During the lockdown, the company had tied up with unlikely partners like Domino's, Zomato and Swiggy for home deliveries of its products, which could be continued in future as well.

He said the company continues to have aspiration to garner revenue of Rs 1 lakh crore from FMCG business despite the impact of COVID-19, although ""the timelines may get pushed further"".

In 2015, ITC had set a target of garnering a revenue of Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030 from its FMCG business.

Puri, however, said ITC will not launch many new products during the coronavirus pandemic and only those health and hygiene products which are essential for consumers will be introduced in the market, like the hand sanitiser introduced under its Savlon brand."

It had partnered with food delivery chains such as Domino's, Swiggy and Zomato along with community centric apps such as ApnaComplex, MyGate, No broker and Azgo which had the readiness to address delivery to housing societies in metros.

The company had also joined hands with logistics player like Dunzo besides opening up directly to the consumers with its portal ITCstore.in with an aim of ensuring uninterrupted supplies of essential items and foods to its consumers.

""The ecosystem of collaborations with emerging distribution channels could become mainstream going forward,"" an ITC spokesperson said when asked if these partnerships would continue once the health crisis is over.

COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions View more How does a vaccine work? A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine. How many types of vaccines are there? There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine. What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind? Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time. View more Show

Through the new distribution channel ITC has been able to deliver its myriad products such as Aashirvaad Atta, Yippee noodles, Sunfeast biscuits, B-Natural juices, Savlon range of soap and hygiene products and floor disinfectant brand Nimyle, which were on high demand during the lockdown.

Commenting on the emerging channels, ITC Ltd Executive Director B Sumant said the coronavirus pandemic has subjected the country and its citizens to an unprecedented situation.

""To provide support to consumers during such trying times, we decided to address the distribution challenge in line with our core principles of innovation, agility and empathy,"" he added.

The company's ""unique partnerships with food delivery chains, consumer food apps, community e-commerce brands, and our own direct to consumer portal have been instrumental in providing timely supply of essentials to consumers during the lockdown and thereby ensuring that people remained confined to their homes”, Sumant said.

The partnership with Domino's was one of the first partnerships ITC embarked upon through which the company's food products such as Aashirvaad Atta and Aashirvaad Spices were made available in multiple markets starting from Bengaluru and expanding to other key metros.

Depending on effectiveness, the company plans to expand the partnership further in the future.

ITC seems to be ready to take a u-turn after the fall in price halted around the reversal zone of a Bullish Butterfly pattern on the weekly chart and started rebounding in the last few days. The stock rose nearly 7 percent on April 3.

We are witnessing a double-bottom kind of formation on the daily chart. RSI oscillator started moving northward from the oversold territory on both daily and weekly scale, which is a sign of relief for the bulls.

The stock had a strong bear phase in the last one year and corrected by more than 50 percent. The fall was supported by the huge short formation in the futures segment.

The open interest has reached to highest ever level of 16.91 crore on March 6 but, we witnessed a good amount of unwinding in the stock in the later fortnight of the March series, indicating that traders gradually exited their short positions.

At the current juncture, the stock is comparatively light on positions and marginal long build-up is seen in the current bounce which is a positive sign for the counter.

Looking at the overall chart structure and derivatives data, we are expecting a bounce in the stock towards Rs 210 levels in the coming weeks. Thus, any dip toward 173 shall be used as a buying opportunity with a stop-loss of Rs 160.

Diversified conglomerate ITC has emerged as a strong contender to acquire controlling stake in Kolkata-based packaged spice maker Sunrise Foods as it looks to build its food business further and take on competitors such as Hindustan Unilever, PepsiCo and Britannia, sources told Moneycontrol.

An exclusivity agreement has been signed between both parties and the deal valuation is pegged in the range of Rs 2,000-2,500 crore, a source said. “The sale process has been on for the last four to five months and is being handled by investment bank JM Financial. Several private equity players had expressed interest earlier and now ITC has emerged as a strong contender,” the source said.

Another source said the target company is in ITC's backyard and presents locational advantages, adding that through this proposed deal, the conglomerate can add to its product pipeline and bolster its presence in the spices segment. ""Most domestic spice brands are scattered in different regions and don’t have a full-fledged pan-India presence. Due to its immense network, ITC can easily scale up Sunrise Foods beyond its core market in West Bengal,” the source said.

A third source said the recent market volatility due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, is likely to have impacted pace of negotiations. In terms of the deal structure, it could be mixture of cash and equity which is a mode preferred by the sellers, the person added.

All the persons Moneycontrol spoke to did not wish to be named.

Responding to an email questionnaire from Moneycontrol, a spokesperson for ITC, which runs businesses as diverse as food and hospitality, said, ""As per company policy, we do not comment on market speculation.”

Moneycontrol has sent reminders and is awaiting email responses from Sunrise Foods and JM Financial and will update this article as soon as it hears from them.

The Sharma family-promoted Sunrise Foods counts brands such as Everest Spices and MDH Masala as rivals and offers a range of products such as whole spices, basic ground spices, blended or mix spices, instant mix, compounded asafoetida, mustard oil and pappadums. Founded in 1902, the company owns four factories in Bikaner, Jaipur, Agra and Kolkata and is present across nine states.

Sunrise’s operations are largely centred in east India, including the northeast states. It has also expanded to Bangladesh and Nepal. Sales in FY19 are estimated at around Rs 1,000 crore. Earlier media reports have named private equity firms Carlyle, TA Associates and Norway’s Orkla Foods as interested suitors.

ITC has been looking to tilt the revenue mix from its mainstay tobacco to FMCG across categories. “To accelerate growth in the FMCG businesses, the endeavour is not only to fortify the existing categories towards delivering industry leading performance but also to foray into newer categories and sub-segments. This would be supported by multi-dimensional investments as well as strategic opportunities for acquisitions,” ITC's Sanjiv Puri told shareholders in July 2019 during his debut AGM address as chairman.

ITC posted a net revenue of Rs 44,415 crore and profit after tax of Rs 12,464 crore for FY19. Revenue from FMCG and related businesses at Rs 12,505.28 crore. Under its FMCG segment, ITC sells packaged foods, personal care, and stationery housing brands like Aashirwad, Sunfeast biscuits, Yippie noodles, B Natural juices, Vivel soaps and Bingo chips."

In a bid to meet the huge demand for santisers during the COVID-19 outbreak, FMCG major ITC has converted its perfume manufacturing facility in Himachal Pradesh into a disinfectant-making unit and commenced production of Savlon Sanitisers, the company said in a press release.

Amidst the global health crisis and the unprecedented surge in demand for hand hygiene products like sanitisers, ITC’s perfume factory will produce an additional 1,25,000 litres of Savlon Hand Sanitisers.

Commissioned in November 2019, the factory at Manpura in Himachal Pradesh was a facility designed to produce premium fine fragrances.

“During these challenging times, ITC has redoubled its efforts to ensure enhanced supply and availability of Savlon range of products in the market. This intervention will enable ITC to meet the demand surge for sanitisers in the market,” it said.

In line with the government's order and in public interest, ITC has also reduced prices of Savlon sanitisers.

Availability of workers at factories and trucks for transportation remain key challenges to meet the demand for essential items, according to FMCG majors ITC and Dabur India.

The companies, however, said the approvals for plant operations and transportation of goods have eased difficulties in the movement of raw materials and finished products.

Addressing of local issues in many states that have hindered the movement of goods would certainly help in kick-starting the functioning of the supply chain, they said.

""But, the key issue that still remains is the availability of manpower and workers to run these operations.

Sharing similar experience, an ITC spokesperson said, ""While we have progressively obtained permissions in some states, availability of trucks continues to be the biggest challenge at the moment. Interstate and local truck movement has been severely impacted together with the challenge of shortage of manpower in factories.""

The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is an oscillator originally developed in 1980 by Donald Lambert and featured in his book ""Commodities Channel Index: Tools for Trading Cyclical Trends"". The commodity channel index (CCI) is an oscillator used to identify cyclical trends in indices, ETFs, stocks, and commodities.

CCI measures the difference between a security's price change and its average price change. High or positive readings indicate that prices are well above their average, which shows strength. Low or negative readings indicate that prices are well below their average, which shows weakness.

This indicator measures the current price level relative to an average price level over a given period of time; however, the default period is taken as 20. The CCI can be adjusted to the timeframe of the market traded on by changing the averaging period.

Why buy 'ITC'?

There are a lot of trading strategies that put CCI into use. The below mentioned one is one of the most popular among the trading community which involves buying after bullish divergence formation and keeping low as a stop loss for higher movement. However, support of another indicator Bollinger Band can give additional support.

Recently, the stock logged a key low of Rs 135 and managed to close higher above the previous five days' high indicating bulls are active on lower levels and strong buying is emerging below Rs 140 mark. At the same time, CCI traded below -250 which is called as oversold or reversal levels and the possibility of bouncing back towards neutral levels of 0 is very high. Prices traded lower but closed above lower Bollinger band with a big bullish candlestick pattern also suggest buying setup and prices can move towards the middle band of Bollinger Band.

The Indian market is at a multi-year low and benchmark indices are experiencing relentless fall which has forced investors to look for quality stocks that are at cheap levels now and may give healthy gains in the long term.

Among the blue-chip stocks, ITC is a stock which, brokerages say, has corrected sharply and is now ready to move upward.

As of March 19 close, shares of ITC have fallen 32 percent on BSE in the calendar year 2020, in sync with a 31 percent fall in Sensex during the same period.

Brokerage firm JM Financial finds the stock too cheap to ignore.

""We see deep value in the stock at the current price and find it too cheap to ignore. ITC’s operating profit growth even during the past three years (FY16-19) was at 8.4 percent CAGR –a pace similar to that of Asian Paints’ (8.4 percent CAGR) and much higher vs Dabur’s (4.6 percent) but its stock price is down more than 25 percent over the past four years while Asian Paints’ the stock has doubled and Dabur’s has grown 73 percent during the same period.,"" said JM Financial.

The brokerage has a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 315, which is a 95 percent upside from the current market price of the stock at Rs 161.95. As per the estimates of the brokerage, ITC currently trades at a headline PE of 11.5 times on a one-year forward basis (based on FY21 EPS) and 10.4 times on FY22 basis.

JM Financial highlighted that ITC’s headline one-year forward PE multiple is now less than 12 times, which is at a discount to Nifty50 and also 50 percent below its own five-year and ten-year PE averages. The implied PE (FY21 basis) for the cigarettes business is 7 times – lower than even most global tobacco stocks.

Moreover, The implied PE (FY21 basis) for the cigarettes business is 7 times which is lower than even most global tobacco stocks.

ITC's huge cash surplus hints that the dividend payout may move up going forward.

""ITC’s net-cash surplus is estimated to be Rs 36,100 crore at March 2020-end against Rs 30,700 crore at March 2019-end and the company’s yearly FCFF (free cash flow to the firm) generation is of the order of more than Rs 10,000 crore. The huge cash-surplus at its disposal (about 70 percent of annual revenue, 19-20 percent of market cap), there is a clear case for

dividend payout ratio to move up from 72-73 percent in recent years (average) to more than 80 percent going forward,"" JM Financial said.

The brokerage also added that the company has recently updated its dividend policy which now cites a payout ratio of 80- 85 percent of post-tax profit over the medium-term – this would peg dividend per share at more than Rs 10 for FY20E which would translate into a dividend yield of more than 6.5 percent at the current market price.

Brokerage firm ICICI Securities, too, has a 'buy' call on ITC with a target price of Rs 220, an upside of 36 percent.

The brokerage said with the increase in the guided payout ratio to 80-85 percent from nearly 70 percent currently, ITC has addressed an important investor concern of capital allocation – particularly hotels capex which has mostly been EVA (economic value added) negative.

The brokerage expects ITC stock to rerate as, over the past two decades, big rerating events for ITC were steep jumps in the dividend pay-out to 40-45 percent range over FY05-09 from 30-35 percent range earlier and then the second instance of increasing it to 65-70 percent range in FY10 from 45-50 percent range earlier.

ICICI Securities said its earnings estimates for ITC are broadly unchanged and it had only adjusted for higher dividend payment. ""We are modelling revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 9/8/5 percent, respectively, over FY20-22E,"" ICICI said.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services is of the view that ITC's dividend payout increase acts as a silver lining at a time when pace of near term earnings growth for the company is uncertain given weak performance of late and the NCCD increase in the budget.

The brokerage currently has a 'neutral' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 196 which is a 21 percent upside.

In the last few weeks, a slew of FMCG companies announced their Q3 (Oct-Dec) earnings for FY20. Most FMCG companies reported net profit in the third quarter.

However, as per management commentary from companies, they are still grappling with liquidity constraints. Here is a low-down on major FMCG corporate results.

The overall trends suggest moderate sales revenue growth ranging from 2.6 percent to 11 percent while the profits have grown in double-digits for all.

The cut in corporate tax in September 2019 has had an impact on surging the profit margins. This should help in trickle-down effect of FMCG reviving investment cycle from higher profits, said an analyst from a brokerage firm.

Hindustan Unilever

FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL), reported a double digit profit growth in the October-December quarter at 11.9 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,616 crore, driven by lower commodity cost mainly.

Revenue increased 2.6 percent to Rs 9,808 crore, while domestic consumer growth was 4 percent with underlying volume growth at 5 percent.

HUL expects the overall market in the near term to remain challenging led by high retail inflation, liquidity issues, and lower GDP estimate.

The consumption in discretionary categories remained more impacted than food categories.

According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services, HUL has been a stellar performer over the past decade, both in earnings (around 13 percent CAGR) and stock price which climbed 884 percent.

Also, it has significantly outperformed some of its largecap consumer peers over the same period.

ITC

Cigarettes-hotels-to-FMCG major ITC recorded huge 29.07 percent year-on-year growth in Q3FY20 profit, beating analyst expectations.

Profit for the quarter stood at Rs 4,141.9 crore, increased from Rs 3,209.1 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal as tax expenses fell 44.6 percent YoY due to cut in corporate tax rate by the government last year.

Revenue growth was 5.1 percent YoY at Rs 12,103 crore for the quarter. Of this, cigarette business contributed 44 percent to total revenue, increased 4.7 percent YoY to Rs 5,310.98 crore with EBIT rising 5.6 percent to Rs 3,755.97 crore, while revenue from FMCG and others grew by 3.5 percent to Rs 3,312.32 crore with EBIT growing 40.4 percent to Rs 107.62 crore in Q3FY20 YoY.

All verticals, which include cigarettes, other FMCG offerings (branded packaged foods, apparel, education and stationery, personal care, matches and incense sticks), hotels business, paperboards, paper, and packaging, as well as agribusiness reported an increase in turnover.

In terms of profit before tax (PBT), all the verticals also reported an increase in numbers.

Brokerage houses believe that the sales volume will be affected with the cigarette price hike in the budget.

""If the cess on cigarettes is increased it would affect sales volumes of ITC’s cigarette business as the company will pass on the increase in rate to consumers through price hikes,"" KR Choksey had said in its Budget expectations report.

Marico

On January 30, Marico reported a nearly 10 percent increase in consolidated net profit to Rs 276 crore for the quarter ended December 2019 driven by gross margin expansions as against a net profit of Rs 251 crore in the October-December quarter a year ago.

However, net sales dropped by 1.98 percent to Rs 1,824 crore during the quarter under review compared to Rs 1,861 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.

Dabur

Dabur India posted in-line numbers for the quarter ended December 2019 (Q3FY20) with consolidated net profit rising 8.9 percent at Rs 400 crore as compared to a profit of Rs 367.2 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.

The consolidated sales grew 7 percent YoY mainly led by an international business (12 percent constant-currency growth). The domestic business, which constitutes 71 percent of sales, grew by 5.6 percent entirely on the back of a 5.6 percent volume growth. Excluding the food business, volume growth was 7 percent.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) jumped 10.7 percent at Rs 493 crore versus Rs 445.4 crore and the margin was at 21 percent versus 20.3 percent.

In contrast to the industry trends, rural demand growth was 4 percentage points ahead of urban demand growth because of Dabur’s improving distribution reach in the hinterland.

According to brokerage houses, weaker rural consumption growth and category headwinds for juices remain the factors to watch.

The foods segment (12.5 percent of sales) remains the key laggard with a sales decline of 2 percent. As per Nielsen, the juices and nectar category saw volumes shrinking 11.6 percent in Q3 as consumers moved to lower-priced alternatives such as dairy-based drinks and carbonated drinks. However, the company seems to be gaining market share in this declining category.

Godrej Consumer

FMCG major Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) on January 29 reported a 5.11 percent increase in consolidated net profit at Rs 445.20 crore in the third quarter ended December, helped by volume growth in domestic business as compared to net profit of Rs 423.52 crore in October-December quarter a year ago.

Nestle

The company’s Q3 net profit jumped 38.4 percent to Rs 473 crore as against Rs 341.8 crore for same period last fiscal. Revenue rose 8.7 percent to Rs 3,149.3 crore versus Rs 2,897.3 crore, YoY.

Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 23.1 percent at Rs 677.9 crore against Rs 550.6 crore and EBITDA margin was up 250 bps at 21.5 percent versus 19 percent, YoY.

The company board recommended a final dividend for the year 2019 of Rs 61 per equity shares of Rs 10 each.

Britannia

Britannia Industries on February 7 reported a 23.26 percent year-on-year (YoY) rise in its consolidated net profit to Rs 369.9 crore for the December quarter of the financial year 2020 against Rs 300.10 crore reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year.

Britannia’s December quarter consolidated sales growth decelerated considerably. It grew by 5 percent YoY (year on year) compared to 6 percent in Q2 FY20 and 11 percent in Q3 FY19.

Volume growth of 2 percent in Q3 FY20 compared to 3 percent in H1 FY20 signifies a worsening of the demand slowdown. Slowdown in demand was predominantly seen in rural areas which contribute to 20 percent of sales.

Brokerage houses believe that overall, the quarterly result were weaker than already lowered expectations and signals that consumption recovery would be gradual at best."

After suffering deep losses in the last two sessions, share price of ITC rose about 3 percent on BSE in the morning trade on February 4.

In the last two sessions, the stock retreated by almost 12 percent as investors went on a selling spree after the Union Budget proposed to raise excise duty on tobacco and cigarettes.

ITC is India’s largest cigarette-maker and brokerages say the duty hike will dent sales volume of the company.

""If the cess on cigarettes is increased, it would affect sales volumes of ITC’s cigarette business as the company will pass on the increase in rate to consumers through price hikes,"" KR Choksey had said in its Budget expectations report.

Analysts attributed the rise in the stock as value-buying and said all was not lost for the heavyweight stock.

Some brokerages maintained their buy recommendation on the stock but with a reduced target price.

""In view of the concerns on volume in the short term, we slightly tweaked our earnings per share (EPS) forecast of FY21E and FY22E. Also, we are lowering the target PE multiple to 23 times from 27 times earlier. Consequently, our target price stands revised to Rs 341. We maintain buy recommendation on the stock,"" brokerage firm Antique Stock Broking said in a report on February 3.

Investec has maintained a buy call but cut the target to Rs 259 from Rs 290 per share.

“It is the first sizeable increase in taxes on cigarettes since July 2017 and we expect the company to raise prices by over 6-7 percent,” it said.

The research house cut EBITDA estimates by 3.7/5.6 percent for FY21/22, cut cigarette volume & EBIT growth assumptions from 4 percent to 2 percent for FY21/22, while maintaining buy due to decadal low valuations.

JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight and cut target to Rs 235.

The tax hike would impact volume growth and weigh on stock multiples. The strong economic franchise makes it attractive at 5-7 percent potential downside, said JP Morgan.

With NCCD hike, tax incidence is 10 percent higher versus pre-budget levels and expect higher price increase to drive positive EBIT growth, it said.

It forecasted a 12 percent price hike over FY21 to deliver cigarette EBIT growth of 5 percent and lower FY21/22E EPS estimates by 3 percent. Also, EBIT growth forecast lowered to 5 percent in FY21.

Other income during the quarter grew by 17.5 percent YoY to Rs 983.62 crore, but there was an exceptional loss of Rs 132.11 crore in Q3 as the leaf tobacco stocks (including taxes) destroyed at a third party owned warehouse due to fire, for which insurance claim has been filed and is under process, company said in its BSE filing.

Cigarette-to-FMCG major ITC on January 31 is expected to report double-digit growth in Q3FY20 profit driven largely by a lower corporate tax.

According to brokerages, the bottom line is seen rising more than 18 percent YoY, with revenue growth in the range of 6-7 percent for the quarter ended December 2019.

The top-line growth is likely to be driven by all segments, with hotels (over 15 percent YoY) and agri (over 10 percent YoY) businesses showing double-digit growth but impacted by low-demand sentiment and liquidity crunch in the market.

Cigarette, FMCG and paper segments could report around 6-8 percent revenue growth, while the cigarette segment could be in the 2.5-3.5 percent range YoY.

""We model 2.5 percent YoY increase in cigarette volumes and 3.5 percent increase in realisation (portfolio-level). We forecast 8.8 percent YoY growth in cigarette EBIT,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities, which expects 18.4 percent YoY growth in profit and 7.2 percent in revenue YoY.

The brokerage expects 6.5 percent, 17 percent and 10 percent YoY growth in FMCG, hotels and agri-business, respectively.

PhillipCapital, which expects 20 percent growth in profit and 5.5 percent in revenue, feels cigarette volume growth (up 3 percent YoY) could taper down due to unfavourable base, loss of market share to GPI and VST, price hikes in economy segment and rural slowdown.

At operating level, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) may see 7-12 percent growth YoY and margin expansion could be more than 100bps YoY in Q3FY20.

""EBITDA margin is expected to be up by 134 bps YoY to 39.9 percent on account of improved product mix, stepped up investments and expansion in newer categories,"" said Narnolia which sees EBITDA growth of 10 percent YoY.

""Gross margin shall see healthy improvement (up 42bps YoY) due to run-down of high-cost inventory and import substitution of imported cigarette. EBITDA margin (up 117bps YoY) could see slight improvement on price hikes in the value segment, improving profitability from FMCG business, and significant improvement in cyclical and capex-intensive (hotels, paper) on industry upturn,"" said PhillipCapital which sees EBITDA growth of 8.7 percent YoY.

""In 2019, most consumer staples stocks underperformed the market with discretionary/ urban proxies faring better. Even then, most companies in our coverage continue to trade at a premium compared to their last 5/10-year average one year forward P/E,"" BNP Paribas said.

The global brokerage sees a risk to consensus earnings estimates as well as multiples. Hence, it downgraded Nestle India, Godrej Consumer Products and Titan Company to reduce (from hold); and Dabur, Emami and Jubilant Foodworks to hold (from buy).

FMCG sector was one of the underperformers in 2019 with the Nifty FMCG index falling 1.3 percent against the Nifty50 (up 12 percent) due to sharp correction in Emami, ITC, Godrej Consumer Products, Marico and United Spirits.

But the rally in HUL, Dabur, Colgate, Nestle India, Tata Global and Jubilant Foodworks limited the loss of FMCG index during the year.

""Most macro indicators that we track such as rural wage growth, consumer confidence and unemployment data have worsened in the past few quarters. Savings rate as well as nominal GDP growth rate have also declined,"" the brokerage said.

FMCG companies' operating margins, which have been improving consistently, could also be at risk from the recent inflationary trends in palm oil, LAB and agri commodities, according to UBS which calculated that telecom spending by consumers, which fell by $10 billion over FY16-19, could increase by $6-8 billion in FY21E, some of which could come at the cost of FMCG spending.

The risks to its negative view are a sharp recovery in rural growth and significant acceleration in government's direct benefit transfer schemes, the brokerage said.

BNP Paribas continued to like ITC and Marico for growth at reasonable valuations and retained buy recommendation on the stocks.

Consumer sales growth has slowed over the past five years, but earnings growth remained healthy aided by benign raw material costs and reduction in indirect and direct tax burden, said the brokerage.

It viewed that high government expenditure and low consumer spending on telecom might have also supported sales.

In Q2 FY20, sales of companies under its coverage universe grew 5.4 percent YoY, lagging nominal GDP growth of 6.1 percent.

Unless the gross domestic product (GDP) growth recovers sharply, we see risks to Bloomberg consensus estimates as new headwinds like higher commodity prices, risks to government spending and telecom tariff hikes have emerged.

Shares of ITC declined 1.27 percent to Rs 241.25 on BSE on December 20, extending the losses into the second consecutive session.

As of December 20, the stock has lost 14 percent of its market value in the calendar year 2019, against an almost 16 percent rise in Sensex.

Concerns on the tax increase, loss of market share and worries related to ESG (environmental, social and governance) investing has led to significant underperformance of the stock.

At this juncture, the question looms - what lies ahead for the stock.

Domestic brokerage firm JM Financial highlighted that the GST Council’s decision to study and evaluate various alternatives for bridging revenue and compensation cess shortfall instead of using cigarette cess as the only go-to option is proof enough that the government is perhaps no longer looking at over-taxing legal cigarettes to deal with just about any fiscal-related challenge that may arise in the country.

""This is a re-rating event for ITC, we believe - the cigarettes business currently trades at sub-15 times its NTM post-tax earnings, and should increase confidence on ITC’s ability to deliver a steady topline and earnings growth in the years ahead,"" JM Financial said.

JM Financial believes a hike in cigarette taxes is reasonably sure to come about someday or the other, though, a moderate hike therein could actually bode well for the stock as it would remove an overhang on when and what would be the modus operandi of a tobacco tax hike under the GST regime.

A tax hike also provides a valid reason for tobacco companies to finally take a national-level price hike after all these years, which is as important from a value sales-growth perspective as it is to stop the ongoing low-price strategy being followed for capsules cigarettes by smaller players in the industry, JM Financial said.

JM Financial has a buy recommendation on the stock with a target price of Rs 335 for a 12-month timeframe.

Foreign brokerage firm Macquarie believes the stock is pricing in a near-worst-case scenario on the tax increase and market share loss.

The brokerage has an 'outperform' view on the stock with a target price of Rs 376 for the next 12 months and is building in a nearly 16 percent consolidated earnings CAGR over FY19-22E.

Macquarie believes ITC is closer to the bottom valuations as at the current price it is building in nearly 6 percent FCF (free cash flow) growth for the interim period of FY23-30E with terminal growth of 4 percent.

""Effectively, for the cigarette business, the interim period growth built is about 4-4.5 percent FCF CAGR which we believe is the worst-case scenario and implies flattish to minor negative volume growth. ITC’s last 7 years’ FCF CAGR is nearly 12 percent despite a punitive taxation regime. We believe the concerns on higher taxation and market share loss are overdone,"" Macquarie put in.

Significant growth in the capsules segment in the last three years with ITC being under-indexed in the category was, in Macquarie's view, a big reason for overall market share loss.

The brokerage believes ITC was not very aggressive in the capsule segment initially as it had margin dilution implications and now with established products in place in the capsule segment, ITC is well placed to gain back market share in the capsule segment.

ITC is also expected to gain the market share owing to its strong distribution system.

""We believe a strong distribution remains the key competitive advantage in the category and we see ITC gaining back the market share over the medium-term,"" said Macquarie.

In a report on December 11, domestic brokerage firm IIFL Securities said at 17 times FY21 earnings per share (EPS), ITC is among the cheapest consumer stocks, trading at nearly 30 percent discount to its 10-year average.

IIFL has a buy recommendation on ITC with a target price of Rs 295 for a 12-month horizon.

Global financial services company Credit Suisse expects the economic slowdown to continue in 2020.

Earnings may bounce back and investing in ""safe stocks"" should be the prefered strategy for next year, the brokerage said in a report, India Market Strategy, released last week.

“Market performance in CY20 thought would be affected by how FY22 EPS moves—we expect this too to settle at a low to mid-teens growth on the reduced FY21 base. We expect narrow market performance to continue for now, as economic uncertainty continues to push funds into the safe stocks,” said the note.

For 2020, Credit Suisse has shifted to a more concentrated 30-stock portfolio where they have tried to reduce concentration risk by being more overweight on SBI than HDFC Bank.

The global investment bank will stay overweight on financials, telecom, utilities and metals. Pharma and IT also received minor uptick. It has a ‘Market Weight’ on staples and Underweight on discretionary cement, and industrials.

Top 30 stocks in Credit Suisse portfolio include RIL, HDFC Ltd, TCS, HUL, ICICI Bank, ITC, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finance, SBI, Tech Mahindra, Coal India, Dabur, Lupin, Chola Finance, ICICI Prudential, and Motherson Sumi.

Credit Suisse also highlighted ""quality bubble"" which is likely to remain inflated for some more time till growth comes back.

The global investment bank in the report highlighted that foreign investors reacted to the weak economic activity levels. FPIs too have been focusing on the top 100 names, though that has been their focus generally.

Almost 76 percent of the FPI holdings are in the Nifty stocks, compared to 66 percent for the domestic institutional holdings. This ratio for DIIs was 56 percent a year back.

As a result, performance is becoming lopsided, driven primarily by a select few large and liquid stocks, with the majority of stocks being 20-30 percent below their all-time highs even though most indexes are close to lifetime highs.

“Till growth uncertainty continues (we expect for another six months), we expect this “quality bubble” to stay inflated and market concentration to remain high,” said the note.

Diversified conglomerate ITC is looking to garner up to 20 per cent of the Rs 7,400-crore frozen food market in India in next three years with the firm expanding its offering in the category, a senior company official said on Wednesday. The company, which has recently made a foray into the frozen food segment under ITC Master Chef brand targeting both retail and food services players, is also planning to expand its reach to over 30 cities in the retail segment and 100 cities in food services segment during the period.

""Currently, the frozen foods market in India is about Rs 7,400 crore and it is growing at about 17 per cent annually...Our intention is to explode the category. We are doubling our volumes. Our growth rate is about 6-7 times the industry growth,"" ITC Chief Executive - Frozen Snacks, Fruits and Vegetables Sachid Madan told PTI here.

He said the company's growth in the category will be on the back of expansion of the range that it is offering and ""also because of the fact that we are offering freshly frozen food with no preservatives and can be cooked in multiple ways"".

""We are in both (vegetarian and non-vegetarian) segments and we are beyond even chicken. In the categories in the market that we are present, we are aiming at 15-20 per cent share over the next three-odd years as we establish our distribution,"" Madan said.

ITC will be the third major organised player in the frozen food segment after McCain, which is mainly in the vegetarian segment and Venky's, which is in non-vegetarian, he added.

At present, depending on outlets and range, ITC's current market share will vary from 5-15 per cent in the segment.

""The market is very small compared to its potential. The idea is if it is growing at 17 per cent how can we accelerate it? When we are growing at 100 per cent, it will definitely grow,"" he said.

The company has introduced over 50 different frozen food products under ITC Master Chef brand. These include a variety of Indian flavours such as 'Mumbai Vada Pops', 'Rajmah ki Galauti', 'Chicken Galauti', 'Falafel Kebab', 'Achari Beetroot Kebab', among others.

Madan said,""These items are now available in 60 cities under the food service portfolio and 11 cities in retail outlets. In the next three years 60 will go to 100 and beyond and 11 will go to about 30.""

The focus is on expanding penetration of the category and dispel the myth about frozen foods not being healthy in consumers' mind, he said.

To begin with, the company is looking at metros and urban areas for these products but these will also be made widely available to consumers and food services segment, including restaurants, cafes and pubs across India, including tier II and III cities, he added.

ITC has partnered with American firm OSI and is utilising the latter's manufacturing facilities in India to produce these items.

""We are manufacturing in Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. We are kind of covering most of the places where the markets are,"" Madan said."

Advertising sector watchdog ASCI upheld complaints against 344 misleading advertisements, including those of Dabur India, ITC, Parle, Amul, Nestle, Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF), for August and September.

ASCI investigated complaints against 564 advertisements of which 179 advertisements were promptly withdrawn by the advertisers on receipt of communication from ASCI.

The independent Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) of ASCI evaluated 385 advertisements, of which complaints against 344 advertisements were upheld. Of these 344 advertisements, 259 belonged to the education sector, 50 belonged to the healthcare sector, eight to personal care, eight to the food & beverages sector, and 19 were from the ‘others’ category.

There were several prominent brands in the food and beverage sector making comparative claims regarding the product composition, taste preferences, health benefits or market leadership.

According to the ASCI report, many of the claims were not adequately substantiated. The CCC also considered the comparisons to be unfairly denigrating the entire category in which the advertiser brands were competing in.

ASCI pulled up GCMMF (Amul), Nestle India, Parle Ltd advertisements and found them to be misleading.

Gujarat Co-Operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) Amul Butter Cookies presented their butter cookies to be superior due to presence of 25 percent butter and zero percent vegetable oil.

However, they made a sweeping statement that “other” butter cookies contain only 0.3 percent to 3 percent butter and 20 percent to 22 percent vegetable oil without presenting any verifiable evidence.

ASCI pulled up Nestle India Ltd for advertisement of Maggi Nutrilicious New Masala Oats and Maggi Nutrilicious New Masala Veg Atta. The advertisement did not clearly indicate whether the noodles are ""Fried"" or ""Non-Fried"".

This was considered to be a violation of FSSAI Regulation, 2011 which states that “instant noodle product shall be presented as ‘Fried Noodles or Non-Fried Noodles’. The information needs to be “presented” as required by the FSSAI within the advertisement - regardless of where it appears (i.e. on pack, digital advertisement, YouTube advertisement).

ASCI also found that Parle Products Limited (Parle Happy Happy Biscuits)- The back panel of product pack claims “Net Weight: 60g + 20g* Extra = 80g with MRP Rs.10.00”, and front panel of pack claims “33%* extra”.

Though offer claiming ""33 percent extra"" on 60g pack was not considered objectionable, its presentation on pack was misleading by omission as it does not mention the basis of comparison alongside the offer claim, in font size equal to or more than 25 percent of the font size of ""33 percent extra"" claim.

Similarly ASCI pulled up Dabur India Ltd for their product Odomos Fabric Roll- The product packaging claim, “Just four Dots on Your Clothes, Mosquitoes Won’t Come Close” when seen in conjunction with the visual of the girl surrounded by a blue bubble with no mosquitoes inside and several outside, giving an impression of 100 percent protection was inadequately substantiated.

The product provides only a moderate degree of repellency (4 -40 percent, which is less than half). On the claim of the safety of the product, the CCC observed that the advertiser did not provide any test report of safety for the product when in proximity to human skin.

ASCI also found ITC Ltd (Fiama Scents Bodywash) print advertisement’s claim, “with just a simple touch anytime, anywhere"", was inadequately substantiated and was misleading by ambiguity.

The test data provided, was not adequate to conclusively prove that a forearm lab test on a small number of panel members can be extrapolated to a “real life” bathing, towel drying and post bathing situation to adequately substantiate “capsule deposition all over the body and (fragrance capsules) bursting on touch over a period of 8 hours on dry skin”.

""Recently, as per media reports, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued a statement that the advertisers must desist from making misleading claims and that the food companies could be liable to pay a fine of up to Rs 10 lakhs. Consequences of misleading advertising are grave, not only for the public but also for advertisers as it damages their reputation and breaks consumers' trust in their products. ASCI encourages advertisers to follow the ASCI Code for self-regulation in advertising and Guidelines for Food and Beverages sector in particular so that all stakeholder interests are taken care of,"" said Rohit Gupta, Chairman, ASCI."

FMCG major ITC gained 2.82 percent and auto ancillary Motherson Sumi Systems' 4 percent in the morning trade on November 22.

The gains came after the two companies found a place on Morgan Stanley’s Focus List.

However, the research firm removed Container Corporation of India and Asian Paints from the list. Both stocks have corrected more than 1.5 percent each.

Goldman Sachs has maintained its buy rating on Motherson, with a target price at Rs 155, implying 26.5 percent potential upside from current levels.

The stock has gained 28 percent in the last one month against a 4 percent rally on the BSE Sensex, on the back of solid Q2FY20 results.

""As investors are also looking at improving outlook for global auto demand, we believe Motherson should see sharp improvement in earnings growth in FY21,"" Goldman Sachs said.

However, persistent industry slowdown can undermine its growth, it added.

Motherson Sumi Systems reported a 3.6 percent year-on-year growth in Q2 FY20 net profit due to lower tax cost. Consolidated revenue from operations rose 5.4 percent YoY to Rs 15,924.2 crore, with Samvardhana Motherson Peguform showing a 14.66 percent growth and PKC growing 6.8 percent.

The company's standalone business degrew 17.2 percent YoY. Samvardhana Motherson Reflectec (SMR) reported a 1.48 percent decline in revenue.

Consolidated earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 2.1 percent YoY to Rs 1,319 crore and margin contracted 25 bps YoY to 8.3 percent in Q2, but were ahead of analysts' estimates.

According to a CNBC-TV18 analysts poll, EBITDA was expected at Rs 1,244.1 crore with margin at 7.8 percent for the quarter gone by.

ITC's July-September quarter earnings also beat Street estimates, as profit grew by 36.16 percent year-on-year and revenue from operations increased 5.31 percent YoY.

Cigarette EBIT rose 7.41 percent YoY and cigarette revenue climbed about 6 percent YoY to Rs 5,326.8 crore.

Motherson Sumi Systems was quoting at Rs 126.45, up Rs 3.95, or 3.22 percent, and ITC at Rs 250.80, up Rs 5.10, or 2.08 percent, on the BSE at 1126 hours.

Or should we wait before putting fresh money into markets? Well, these questions are running in your mind, rest assured, you are not alone.

Investors are caught between FOMO which is fear of missing out the rally and fear as the market could witness profit taking at higher levels which could take the index lower.

The S&P BSE Sensex hit a fresh record high of 40,483 on Monday while the Nifty50 is still about 200 points away from hitting its record high above 12,103.

Well, the good news is that the rally is here to stay and experts see the momentum continue and take Nifty50 towards 12,700-13,000 in the next 12 months. Hence, we are in a good buy on dips market.

“We have a one-year forward target of 12,700 for Nifty 50 post-Q1 result, which we are maintaining. The outlook for the equity market has improved post the cut in corporate tax and interest rate, as well as, the reduction in the cost of raw material. All these factors have contributed to better than expected Q2 results,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“Earnings from H2FY20 is likely to better on account of good monsoon and stimulus from the government. A further interest rate cut from the RBI & Fed may improve the liquidity in the medium-term,” he said.

The latest corporate tax cuts are a structural move, and it would improve the corporate earnings estimates by around 7-10 percent thus giving a northwards inflection, which would further continue backed by investments and subsequently consumption-driven demand, suggest experts.

“Over the long term, say 3-5 years, markets are poised for a move northwards backed by solid domestic corporate earnings growth supported by domestic consumption-led demand,” Pankaj Bobade, Head of Fundamental Research at Axis Securities told Moneycontrol.

“The earnings performance of corporates over the last couple of quarters has been picking up though not in a secular manner; the texture, quality of earnings is improving. The impact of corporate tax cuts could be seen from H2FY20 onwards; the impact of any other reforms would be seen 6 months down the line,” he said.

We have collated a list of top 13 fundamentally strong stocks by different experts for your portfolio which could turn out to be big wealth creators in the next 2-3 years:

Expert: D K Agarwal Chairman & MD, SMC Investments and Advisors Limited

Marico

The company will continue to drive sustained profitable volume-led growth over the medium term, through its focus on strengthening the franchise in the core categories and driving the new engines of growth towards gaining critical mass.

Over the medium term, the company retains the target of 8-10 percent volume growth and healthy market share gains in the India business.

The company aims to build Healthy Foods, Premium Hair Nourishment and Male Grooming into growth engines of the future and expects to deliver value growth at 20 percent plus CAGR over the medium term in these portfolios.

On the international front, the company expects to clock organic broad-based double-digit constant currency growth over the medium term.

Larsen & Toubro

The company looks forward to a period of increased investment momentum and continued growth. Initiatives towards improved productivity, cost efficiencies derived from leveraging digital technology, capacity utilisation, and capability enhancement are expected to help the company maximise its shareholder returns (RoE) on a sustainable basis.

Consolidated order book of the group stood at Rs 29,4014 crore as of June 30, 2019, with international order book constituting 21 percent of the total. The company successfully won new orders worth Rs 38,700 crore at the group level during the quarter ended June 30, 2019, registering a growth of 11 percent.

International orders during the year at Rs 9,005 crore constituted 23 percent of the total order inflow. Order wins in Infrastructure and Power segments were the major contributors to the order inflow during the quarter.

UltraTech Cement

The Government's firm commitment to revive the economy and the thrust on infrastructure spending augurs well for the growth of cement demand. The company with its presence across all the zones in the country is the best positioned to take advantage of the revival in cement demand.

As seen in the earlier acquisitions, the management’s ability to turn around the acquired assets provides confidence in the company and the management expects similar performance even in the newly acquired Century assets. UltraTech completed the acquisition of Century's cement business recently.

ITC

Despite an extremely challenging operating environment, the company has consolidated its leadership position in the industry and continued to improve its standing in key competitive markets across the country.

This demonstrates the resilience of the company's portfolio of brands, superior consumer insights and its relentless focus on value creation.

According to the management of the company, the company is focusing on growth of its FMCG business by entering newer segments and tapping the opportunity in the foods segment. This would be a catalyst for topline growth in the long run.

ICICI Bank

The bank is focusing on growing the core operating profit in a risk calibrated manner instead of loan growth. The bank aims to improve the share of profitable market opportunities by making delivery to the customers more seamless and frictionless through digitisation and process improvements.

Business performance of the bank such as domestic loan growth, overall corporate advances, retail loan growth, CASA ratio is continuously improving. The business of the bank increased at an accelerated pace of 18 percent YoY to Rs 12,53,147 crore at the end of June 2019, supported by loan growth improving by 15 percent at Rs 5,92,415 crore.

Meanwhile, the deposits growth galloped to 21 percent at Rs 6,60,732 crore at the end of June 2019. The bank had indicated that credit cost in FY2020 is expected to reduce significantly compared to FY2019.

Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB)

The net interest margins (NIMs) of KMB are amongst the best in the industry and have been in the range of 4-4.6 percent over the last 3 years. The management expects better pricing power in certain high yielding segments which will help in sustaining NIMs.

KMB has maintained benign asset quality with limited exposure to stressed sectors and conservative lending practices. Further improvement in asset quality since FY18 was seen with G/NNPAs at 2.2/0.7 percent in Q1FY20 (Slippages 1.45 percent ann). Provisioning Coverage Ratio stood at 67 percent which provides comfort.

KMB is well positioned due to higher capitalisation (Tier I - 17.3 percent), a strong liability franchise (CASA: 51 percent) and benign asset quality, which would allow it to gain further market share.

RITES

RITES has a strong and diversified order book. RITES’ standalone order book stands at Rs 6,052 crore (3x FY19 revenue). The order book is expected to grow by over 17 percent in FY20 which provides strong revenue visibility for the next 2-3 years.

The Order book is well diversified with high margin consultancy and low margin turnkey business contributing 41 percent each. RITES has a competitive edge in winning orders owing to its over four decades of experience in transport infrastructure consultancy and its association with MoR.

Ample opportunities within railways (50 percent revenue share) being captured by RITES via venturing into turnkey projects and railway station development is increasing its scale of operations. Focus on strengthening EPC business, diversification and continuous infrastructure push by the government is expected to augur well for RITES.

Dixon Technologies

Dixon is a leading player in Flat Panel Display (FPD) TV with over 50 percent market share. It is also a leading player in Lighting accounting for over 35 percent domestic volumes and commands over 40 percent share in the Washing Machines EMS market.

Indian Consumer Electronics and Appliances market is expected to grow at a faster pace of 19 percent CAGR between FY19-21E as compared to global CEA market growth at 8 percent CAGR in the same period. High growth in consumer electronics and increasing EMS presents a huge opportunity for players like Dixon.

We expect strong growth in key segments viz., Consumer Electronics, Lighting and Home Appliances led by a strong order book. The addition of new clients, recovery in the mobile segment and robust growth in the security surveillance segment would aid revenue growth, going forward.

Amber Enterprises

Amber is the market leader in the OEM/ODM industry with 55.4 percent share in volume terms (outsourced market). AEL’s share stands at 19.1 percent in the overall residential air-conditioning (RAC) market in terms of volume.

Key customers include Godrej, Bluestar, Daikin, Hitachi, LG, Panasonic, Voltas, Whirlpool and Carrier Midea, which together account for 75 percent of the market share.

With the acquisition of Sidwal Refrigeration, the company has made a foray in the mobile air-conditioning segment. We believe that Sidwal Refrigeration Industries Pvt Ltd (SRIPL) is a strategic fit in Amber’s portfolio.

Amber will continue to deliver industry-leading growth and is a proxy play in evolving and fast-growing RAC market- the most underpenetrated segment in the white goods category in India.

Avanti Feeds

A leading exporter of processed prawn and fish feeds in India. Avanti has five shrimp feed manufacturing units with a capacity of 6,00,000 MT and two processing and exporting units with a capacity of 22,000 MT.

Being the market leader in the feed segment the company is aiming to become one of the largest players in the processing segment through its capacity addition.

The recent improvement witnessed in farm-gate and stabilisation in export prices provides a better outlook for both Feed and Processing segments. Going forward the revenue/PAT is expected to grow at 14/19 percent CAGR over FY19-21E.

Coromandel International

Largest privately-owned phosphatic fertilizer manufacturers in India with a considerable presence in its home market, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and other nearby states.

The subsequent improvement in monsoon and central government schemes like the Pradhan Mantri-Kisan scheme announced this year to help double farmer income and boost the demand for fertilizer products.

Expect PAT to grow by a CAGR of 17 percent during FY19-21E on the back of an increase in the share of new unique grade products and improvement in margins due to backward integration.

Mold-Tek Packaging:

It is one of the leading manufacturers and suppliers of high quality airtight and pilfers proof containers/pails in India for Paints, Lubricants, Food and FMCG.

The company is credited with shifting Indian paint and lubricant industry to plastic pails from metal containers. Going forward, MTEP is expected to capitalise on long-term growth opportunities, aided by higher volumes due to increasing acceptance of IML in paint and lubricant segments.

Further, focus on capacity expansion, diversification of end-users and penetration into newer markets will drive earnings growth.

L&T Finance Holding

The brokerage has a buy rating on L&T Finance Holding with a target price of Rs 130. LTFH delivered a stable September quarter performance in a very challenging environment.

Focused loan book grew 19 percent on a YoY basis, while asset quality and margins (plus fees) remained largely stable on QoQ. It raise FY20-22e earnings on lower tax outgo.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC has posted another steady quarter with 3% cigarette volume growth in a challenging environment. Overall business momentum is sustained with 6.5% comparable FMCG growth, strong margin outlook in paperboards and sustained margin expansion in FMCG business. Uptick in consumer demand holds key to volume recovery in FMCG even as ITC is gradually inching towards double digit EBIDTA margins over next 3-5 years. Paperboard business is in fine fettle given gains from steady prices and benign input costs. Hotels ARR and occupancy indicates steady improvement in industry dynamics. ITC will gain from deferred tax liability of Rs10.2bn from 2Q to 4Q20.

Outlook

ITC trades at 18.5xFY21 EPS, ~50% discount to our coverage universe with 3% dividend yield and 10.5% PBT CAGR over FY19-22. Risk reward remains favorable, although uncertainty on cigarette taxation remains a drag. Retain ""Buy"" with SOTP based target price of Rs344.

Shares of ITC rallied on October 25, a day after it reported better-than-expected 36.16 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in its standalone net profit at Rs 4,023.1 crore for the September quarter.

A CNBC-TV18 poll had estimated ITC’s second-quarter net profit to the tune of Rs 3,623 crore.

Cigarette EBIT rose 7.41 percent YoY, coming at Rs 3,844.4 crore against Rs 3,579.1 crore in the year-ago period. Cigarette revenue climbed about 6 percent YoY to Rs 5,326.8 crore in Q2FY20 against 5,026.1 crore in Q2FY19

Brokerage firms maintain their ratings on ITC while Emkay Global raised the target price to Rs 274 from Rs 267 earlier. The most aggressive target price of Rs 376 on ITC was put out by Macquarie, which translates into a rise of more than 50 percent from October 24 closing of Rs 248.95.

Macquarie is of the view that concerns about market share loss are overdone. The global investment bank increased FY19-22e EPS by 8 percent on account of a lower corporate tax.

Sharekhan also maintains its buy rating, with a target price of Rs 297. A lower tax incidence drove up a profit after tax (PAT) by 36 percent.

Core cigarette business volumes grew by 3 percent largely driven by higher growth in premium cigarettes, while regular and small-size cigarettes registered muted performance due to higher salience of sales in rural markets.

The non-cigarette FMCG business continues to clock strong profits despite a tough demand environment.

“The company continues to focus on de-risking its business model by increasing the scale of the non-cigarette FMCG businesses. A discounted valuation at 18.1x its FY2021E earnings makes it a good buy in the FMCG space,” a Sharekhan note said.

Emkay is of the view that the cigarette performance was muted again with 6 percent sales growth (similar to Q1), indicating around 3 percent volume growth which is likely to be lower than peers.

FMCG growth was also slower at 4% vs. 6.6% in Q1 though margins showed further improvement. EBIT growth in other business was 10%, led by 14% EBIT growth in the paper division.

“But, the downsides appear to be limited after the significant underperformance of the stock and valuations correcting to 19x FY21E EPS. However, growth triggers are still missing and any possible increase in taxes remains a near-term earnings risk. We maintain hold,” Emkay said.

Beating Street estimates, ITC on October 24 reported a 36.16 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in its standalone net profit at Rs 4,023.1 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2019.

A CNBC-TV18 poll had estimated the second-quarter net profit of ITC to the tune of Rs 3,623 crore.

Cigarette EBIT rose 7.41 percent YoY, coming at Rs 3,844.4 crore against Rs 3,579.1 crore in the year-ago period, while cigarette revenue climbed about 6 percent YoY to Rs 5,326.8 crore in Q2FY20 against 5,026.1 crore in Q2FY19.

EBITDA came at Rs 4,562.4 crore in the September quarter of FY20 while EBITDA margin stood at 38.4 percent.

Segment-Wise

The FMCG-Others Segment delivered a resilient performance during the quarter which witnessed a further slowdown in consumption both in urban and rural markets. Categories with relatively higher rural salience were impacted the most.

""Performance during the quarter reflects the persistent weakness in the overall demand environment, especially in rural markets and wholesale channel, and tight market liquidity conditions. Disruptions/floods in several markets exacerbated the situation,"" the company said in its result statement.

Segment Revenue grew by 6.5 percent approximately on a comparable basis (excluding the Lifestyle Retailing Business) led by atta, potato chips and premium cream biscuits in the branded packaged foods businesses, liquids (Handwash & Bodywash) in the Personal Care Products.

In the Staples, Snacks and Meals Business, `Aashirvaad' atta continued to post robust growth, consolidating its leadership position across markets."

Cigarette-hotel-to-FMCG major ITC is expected to report double-digit year-on-year growth in Q2 profit, largely due to lower tax expenses. Price hike in select cigarettes brands and likely rise in FMCG margin may also boost bottomline.

The stock fell more than 10 percent year-to-date, underperforming Nifty FMCG index (up 4.4 percent in same period) and Nifty (up seven percent).

Brokerages expect Q2 profit growth to be in the 20-34 percent range compared to same period last year. ""Reduction in the tax rate to 25.2 percent (32.4 percent in Q2 FY19) on account of the cut in corporate taxes by the government will lead to PAT growing ahead of EBITDA,"" said Edelweiss, which expects profit to increase 26 percent YoY.

Revenue from operations in quarter-ended September 2019 could be around 6.5 percent, driven by FMCG, hotels and agri segments. Brokerages expect FMCG - others and hotel segments to report double-digit revenue growth, while paper and agri businesses could clock more than five percent growth.

Cigarette business, which contributed more than 40 percent to total revenue, may report 2-4 percent volume growth and 3-4 percent increase in realisation compared to corresponding quarter of last year. Brokerages expect cigarette EBIT to grow 7-8 percent.

""We model 2.5 percent YoY increase in cigarette volumes and 3.5 percent increase in realisation (portfolio-level),"" said Kotak Institutional Equities, which sees overall EBITDA growth of 8.7 percent YoY and 80 bps rise in margin.

Motilal Oswal expects around nine percent growth in ITC's EBITDA and 90 bps increase in margin for the quarter under review.

Key things to watch out for would be trends in cigarette volumes, pricing action, resultant change in mix, and demand outlook for other FMCG businesses."

HDFC: HDFC Ltd would also be a good option given the premium it earns for the management and the brand. This mortgage lender is well-positioned and despite the issues in the NBFC space, it has been standing strong fundamentally.

The company is well placed to serve the growing demand. As far as the financial position of the company goes, it is virtually debt-free and gives a 22-25 percent return on equity, as well as, return on capital employed.

Hindustan Zinc: Since zinc warehouse stock levels are at a near five-year low, any spur in demand would directly benefit Hindustan Zinc as it’s one of the lowest-cost producers in the world.

Q) Any top 5 stocks which are fundamentally sound and could turn out to be wealth creators in the next 2-3 years? A) Five Stocks which would be wealth creators for the next 2-3 years would be Hindustan Zinc , HDFC , SBI Life Insurance , Kotak Mahindra Bank and ITC .

Moreover, investing largely depends on the risk-taking appetite of the investor and his will as to where he wants to invest. Ideally, having a balanced portfolio across large, mid and smallcaps would be recommended.

Q) What are your views on broader market indices? We saw some outperformance last month – do you think the momentum will continue? A) The broader markets will outperform. The small and midcap space is in the initial phase of the bull market but during the mature stage, small and midcaps will catch up.

A recent 50 percent correction of the entire rally by the benchmark indices is very normal in such circumstances.

Trade concerns and corporate tax cuts are two diverging factors, but eventually, the fundamental reality will catch up with them as the tax cuts will play a domino effect to boost liquidity and increase the capex capacity of corporates.

Q) Indian markets seem to have caught up/stuck between trade talk woes, and muted economic data back home. Benchmark indices have also given up almost 50 percent of the gains recorded post the corporate tax cut. What are your views? A) The markets will always keep oscillating between varied sets of challenges. However, the underlying strength of fundamentals will eventually manifest in the stock prices in the long run.

Hindustan Zinc, HDFC, SBI Life Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ITC are the top five stocks to create wealth in the next 2-3 years, Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand. edited excerpts:

Also, millennials are seen educating themselves about the importance of life insurance which would act as a catalyst.

Kotak Mahindra Bank:

Kotak Mahindra Bank would be a great business to invest in given the brand and respect created by the management by succinctly allocating capital to use.

ITC:

ITC would be a good investment at this point. It is a sound company available at a fair price where the management is relentlessly working to improve its retail segment margins which can flair in the near term.

Q) What is keeping FIIs on the sidelines? They have turned net sellers in October as well? What are the big factors which are pushing them away from Indian markets?

A) “Uncertainty is a friend to no one” - FPIs were caught on the wrong footing when the exchequer brought the much-cheered corporate tax cut which overnight decreased the valuation multiples of frontline stocks, making Indian bourses more reasonable in terms of relative valuations.

That being so, FPIs have slowed down selling across Indian equities but have not turned buyers yet. There is every likelihood that they may turn net buyers after the Nifty50 corrects to around 11,000 levels.

Q) Equity mutual fund inflow hits a four-month low in September on profit booking. The total outflow has pulled down the asset base of the MF industry to Rs 24.51 lakh crore in September-end from Rs 25.47 lakh crore at end-August. A slowdown in domestic flows does not spell good news for investors – what are your views?

A) Taking an aggregate view of the mutual fund industry is not appropriate given the fact that around 35 percent of the AUMs are into equities on an AUM size of Rs 25.47 lakh crore base.

Liquid and debt funds are witnessing turbulent times because the economy is ailing under some sort of liquidity crisis. It is therefore natural to expect continued pressure on debt and liquid schemes in the medium term.

However, equity scheme flows are constant at around Rs. 8,200 crore a month which certainly indicates the confidence of retail investors in the equity market.

Q) What are your views on the September quarter earnings from India Inc? Do you think the recent cut in corporate tax rate will lead to more upgrades?

A) Corporate tax cuts will certainly lead to prolific onetime adjustments and not upgrades. However, at an aggregate level, revenues are expected to be slower on a YoY basis.

But, this will not act as a deterrent suppressing the mood of the market. Markets should begin pricing in the revival of the economy given the stupendous Government and RBI initiatives in place.

Q) Fixed income/liquid funds witnessed outflows in September which have been the case for many months now. What should be the strategy of investors while investing in fixed income funds? Important things to watch out for?

A) While investing in Fixed Income funds investors should check the portfolio of investments. The funds should be invested in fundamentally sound large corporates of India, only then one should commit to investing in such income funds.

Q) Which sectors are likely to lead the next leg of the rally for D-Street, and why?

A) The auto sector which faced a lot of flak recently will lead the next leg of D-Street rally with its vehicle scrappage policy.

Given the liquidity crunch and trust deficit in NBFCs, housing finance businesses should come back to become well-positioned biggies.

Q) Does it make sense to go overweight on consumption stocks after the Cabinet increased DA for government employees and the interest is heading lower? What is your outlook on Autos, consumer durable?

A) Dearness allowance to 17 percent which will entail an additional outflow of nearly Rs 16,000 crore may not be significant enough to create an impact on a Rs 2 trillion economy.

But, more than this, it sends out the right signal from the Government that they are using all their might to push economic revival.

Autos will get a boost only if the Government comes out with the scrappage policy and a reduction in GST to spur growth in this beaten-down space as this sector contributes a whopping 49 percent to India’s manufacturing GDP.

Q) Banking stocks have got plenty of attention from the investor community. What are the big reasons for the same?

A) Banking stocks are largely secular and defensive plays in the investor universe as interest income works 24X7 irrespective if the bank makes money or no.

However, the biggest challenge for any banking CEO is ‘asset management’. Due to slowdown and liquidity crisis, the banking sector is facing a lot of flux which is why investors have developed either extreme pessimism or extreme optimism on selected banking stocks which then underperforms or outperforms the index.

Q) Any particular sector which you are advising your client to avoid? If yes, what are the reasons?

A) The heyday for NBFCs are over and the valuation premiums these NBFCs used to enjoy will not come back. Additionally, the incremental growth which they were enjoying for the past couple of years due to the PSU bank clean up drive will not repeat and therefore, NBFCs should be avoided.

Shares of FMCG major ITC jumped more than 2 percent intraday on September 27 after global research firm Morgan Stanley maintained an overweight call on the stock, with target raised to Rs 370 from Rs 360 per share.

Morgan Stanley believes that ITC is one of the biggest beneficiaries of corporate tax cut, adding that increased pricing flexibility would strengthen long-term growth.

ITC's risk-reward ratio is compelling with 4 percent sustainable FY21 dividend yield. However, it does not expect ITC to raise prices in the cigarette portfolio in FY20.

Morgan Stanley estimates ITC to deliver 19 percent FY20 earnings growth, while it forecasts FY20 & FY21 cigarette volume growth of 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively.

The research firm expects FY19-22 revenue, EBIT and PAT CAGR of 10 percent, 10 percent and 14 percent, respectively.

At 1038 hours, ITC was quoting at Rs 255.65, up Rs 5.30, or 2.12 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 258.10 and an intraday low of Rs 250.10."

In a setback to tobacco major ITC, the Securities Appellate Tribunal on Thursday rejected its plea against sale of Hotel Leela Venture's key assets to Canadian PE major Brookfield for Rs 3,950 crore.

The SAT verdict boosts the troubled hotel chain's which is at the bankruptcy tribunal since February, along with its present management controlled by JM Financial ARC's efforts to sell four of its five hotels and come out of the insolvency process.

If completed, the Leela-Brookfield deal will be the largest foreign investment in the hospitality sector and culminates more than a year of talks between the two parties.

ITC had moved SAT after Sebi rejected its contention that sale of Leela's assets to Brookfield Asset Management should not be allowed because of related-party transactions and also because the deal would leave the hotel company with no operating or revenue earning assets barring one property.

A three-bench SAT led by presiding officer Tarun Agarwala and CKG Nair and MT Joshi in a 44-page order posted on its website dismissed the main contention that ""the transaction is related-party in nature"".

After the deal was announced in March, ITC had moved Sebi challenging the deal, following which the regulator asked Leela and JM Financial ARC to put on hold the deal.

The market's regulator had allowed JM Financial ARC, which owns 26 percent in the hotel chain, to vote on the Rs 3,950-crore deal but should not declare the results till the pendency of the case.

The SAT also vacated an earlier stay where it had directed Leela not to declare the postal ballot results till the matter was pending before the tribunal.

Besides, SAT also rejected ITC's plea to suspend its order for two weeks to allow the conglomerate to appeal. It can challenge the SAT verdict in the High Court and also in the Supreme Court.

On March 18, Brookfield had agreed to acquire four Leela hotels in New Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and Udaipur, and also a land parcel in Agra from for Rs 3,950 crore. The flagship Mumbai property is not part of the deal and together these five hotels have over 1,400 rooms.

After the deal announcement, Leela's minority shareholders ITC and LIC approached Sebi alleging that the sale violates the securities laws such as related-party disclosures and takeover code. They also alleged that JM Financial ARC was a related party and could not vote on the board resolution approving the deal.

In June, Sebi had said JM Financial ARC could not be treated as a related party under the Companies Act, 2013 or the Sebi regulations.

The stressed company, it said, has no other interest than using the proceeds for repaying debt. Sebi sought additional disclosures from Leela's promoters on the proposed deal. It called for fresh voting on the deal.

Following failure of a debt restructuring plan, the company transferred its loans from 14 creditors to JM Financial ARC in 2014. After this in September 2017, it allotted over 160 million shares aggregating to 26 percent of equity worth about Rs 275 crore to JM Financial ARC on conversion of debt to equity.

The Brookfield-Leela deal follows the filing of an insolvency petition by JM Financial ARC in late February against the hotel chain.

The deal, the largest in the sector, will also entail buying the Leela brand, existing and all upcoming management contracts of the chain and also absorbing the employees of the four hotels. The previous largest hotel sale was in 2014 when DLF sold Aman Resorts to Aman Resorts Group for Rs 2,250 crore."

The government delivered just what the doctor ordered paving the way for higher growth in the economy and simultaneously giving investors the confidence that the bull cycle is still intact.

In a historic move, the FM announced bold corporate tax reforms. The reduction in the base rate of corporate tax to 22 percent (effective maximum tax rate 25.17 percent) for Financial Year 2019-20 subject to the condition that such companies will not avail any exemption/incentive is one of the boldest tax reforms.

The current base tax rate (excluding surcharge and cess) is 30 percent (effective maximum tax rate 34.944 percent) for companies having a turnover exceeding Rs 400 crores and 25 percent (effective maximum tax rate 29.12 percent) for companies having a turnover up to Rs 400 crores.

What does the tax rate cut mean for Nifty companies?

""There are only 20 Nifty companies which paid more than 30 percent effective tax rate and accounted for 43 percent of the overall net profit in FY19,” Kotak Securities said in a report.

Companies which are paying more than 30 percent tax include names like ZEE Entertainment, HDFC Bank, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finance, Britannia Industries, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Hindalco Industries, Axis Bank, ITC, GAIL India, and JSW Steel.

Fall in taxes will lead to a rise in EPS by double digits which is a positive sign especially at a time when earnings have been muted or largely in single digits for the last 12-18 months.

Nilesh Shah, MD & CEO, Envision Capital in an interview with CNBC-TV18 said that investors should look at buying companies with high tax rates. The other sectors which are likely to benefit are the ones in sectors like consumer, financials and technology services.

“Any company paying 33 percent tax rate will see its earnings go up by 12 percent. Overall, we can see Nifty earnings going up by ~5-6 percent in FY20 as the effective tax rate was already lower at 26 percent,” said Oza.

He further added that the sentiment booster angle and the way this will be taken positively by FIIs and local investors we can expect the Nifty to rally by 9-10 percent from today’s low of ~10,700. Hence, 11,500-11,600 is very much possible on the Nifty without considering any other factor.

The government has taken a hit on revenues of approximately Rs 1.45 lakh crore per annum by reducing corporate tax for existing companies to 22 percent (25.17 percent effective tax) from 30 percent.

There is a big boost for companies going for fresh capex and make in India as tax rates will be just 15 percent for companies making fresh investment and incorporated after 1st Oct 2019,” Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities told Moneycontrol.

The decision not to sell a stake in Coffee Day Global Ltd follows initial talks with potential suitors, including Coca-Cola and ITC Ltd, the people cited above said requesting anonymity.

“The promoters feel that they should first exhaust all other available options to raise funds before committing to the sale of the profitable coffee business, which remains the focus of the group,” the first person cited above said.

Founder Siddhartha, who allegedly committed suicide in July under mounting stress and high debt levels, built CCD from a single café in Bengaluru in 1996 to India’s largest coffee chain with more than 1,750 stores spanning 243 cities. In the process, Coffee Day Enterprises amassed a debt of Rs 6,547 crore as of end March.

To pare debt, the promoters are also exploring the possibility of inducting an investor in Coffee Day Enterprises. The holding company includes Coffee Day Global (coffee business), Sical Logistics Ltd (integrated logistics), Tanglin Developments Ltd (real estate), Way2Wealth (financial services) and Coffee Day Hotels and Resorts Ltd (hospitality). In the year ended March 31, Coffee Day Enterprises reported net operating revenue of Rs 4,264 crore, a 13 percent increase from a year earlier. Profit grew 21 percent to Rs 128 crore.

Soon after Siddhartha’s demise, Coffee Day Enterprises announced the sale of its Global Village Tech Park, owned by unit Tanglin Developments, to US-based buyout giant Blackstone Group Llp for Rs 2,600-3,000 crore in August.

“The group is trying to monetize other assets as well which include its holding in Sical Logistics and the financial services arm,” the person second person cited above said. “The promoters feel that if these transactions conclude then there may not be an immediate need to sell the coffee business.”

In the last financial year, Coffee Day Global posted a 10 percent increase in its net profit to Rs 41 crore. Revenue grew 8 percent to Rs 1,468 crore. Mint reported on July 30 that Siddhartha was in talks to urgently refinance a large portion of his and his company’s outstanding debt taken in his personal capacity. The debt in question is around Rs 2,000 crore and is over and above the consolidated borrowings of CCD group.

“However, the family is cognizant of the group’s debt obligations and may revisit sale of the coffee business at a later date,” the second person said.

“The promoters are in touch with the lenders, who have in turn agreed to extend the flexibility to Coffee Day Enterprises to explore sale of non-core assets for the next six months or so,” the person said. “However, a potential sale will involve a formal bidding process and a bilateral deal is unlikely.”

A regulatory filing by Coffee Day Enterprises has pegged the value of the CCD brand at Rs 7,000-8,000 crore, which includes the coffee chain and more than 54,000 vending machines and over 500 express stores.

Shares of Coffee Day Enterprises fell by the maximum 5 percent daily limit on Wednesday after lenders invoked the pledged shares of the promoters. According to exchange filings, Edelweiss and IndusInd Bank invoked up to 5.24 percent of the company’s pledged shares between 1 and 27 August."

With more consumers getting health conscious, ITC is betting big on health and wellness products.

""The shift from health and wellness products is coming across very important in each of our categories.We have launched protein snacks and some more,"" said Hemant Malik, Chief Executive Officer-Food Division, ITC.

However, he acknowledged that the company was facing challenges with high sugar and salt content in the products.

Speaking at a panel discussion at FICCI FoodWorld India 2019 held in Mumbai, Malik said that ITC's snacks business was growing at a rapid pace of 25 percent over the years, but now it has slowed to 17-18 percent due to a slowdown in the economy.

In line with other industry players, ITC also witnessed growth in their premium segment, but the lower-end was impacted due to the slowdown.

The company, which sells stationery primarily through its Rs 1,500-crore Classmate brand, is focussing on innovation of new products to push sales and tide over the current slowdown and overcome challenges during the off-season period from July to October.

""The segment is not insulated from economic slowdown. There is primarily downtrading and postponement of purchases. In the last six months, in the context of the economy, we have grown in high single digit. It is not in double digits anymore,"" ITC Ltd Chief Executive, Education and Stationery Products Business Division, Shailendra Tyagi told PTI.

Usually, he said, ""When school sessions starts, students buy in bulks. What we are seeing is postponement in such purchases now"".

Also, when slowdown happens what gets hit is the rough notebooks which are used for tuitions or and other rough work, he said.

Tyagi said due to floods in many parts of the country, which had forced closure of schools, sales were impacted as well but once the situation gets normal and schools reopen, sales will pick up.

Expressing optimism of getting back to double digit growth, he said, ""In the last six months, growth had come down for various reasons but by December we should go back to double digits. The season for stationery starts from December (with the beginning of school sessions in different states). We are anticipating we should be able to grow back to double digits"".

He said ITC is also focusing on product innovations to drive the growth.

""When the industry is growing, you grow anyway. If we have accelerate further we have to take the route of product innovation so that what we bring to the table is differentiated,"" Tyagi said.

Recently, the company had launched its Classmate Pulse 3D Notebook, which provides ""an immersive experience"" through a 3-dimensional cover, enabled through a lenticular board.

It had also introduced Classmate Pulse interchangeable notebooks, offering students the option to repeatedly change covers of the notebook and have a different cover whenever desired.

Moneycontrol Research

In this week’s tactical pick, our recommendation is ITC.

The stock has tumbled in the past three months and trades at a steep discount (19.8x FY21e earnings) to the earnings multiple of largecap FMCG sector (~38x).

We believe that this is in contrast to the improving fundamentals of new businesses ITC is exposed to. Further, with relatively stable taxation regime for cigarettes business and improving business mix towards FMCG/food processing industry, the current risk-reward appears favourable for investors.

In addition to attractive valuation, the following makes us constructive on the stock.

The thesis of broadening of growth levers for ITC is unfolding as expected. A few of ITC’s businesses have witnessed encouraging growth traction in recent times: volume growth in the FMCG business (other than cigarettes) and growth outlook in the hotel and paper business.

We are enthused about operating leverage playing out for FMCG business (22 percent of sales in Q1 FY20) in particular. In FY19, FMCG business EBITDA has grown by 51 percent. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that normalisation of ITC’s FMCG business margins in line with peers could help its overall EBITDA margin perk up about 250 bps, ceteris paribus. In the quarter gone by, FMCG sales grew by 8 percent YoY after excluding the impact of restructuring of Lifestyle retailing. The company highlighted that FMCG EBIT witnessed a strong move of 56 percent YoY led by better product mix and operating leverage.

Capital allocation also remains pertinent. The conglomerate continues to deploy healthy operating cash flows (Rs 12,651 crore in FY19), mainly from cigarettes business, for investment across businesses (Rs 2,767 crore). Of this, almost 50 percent of the investment has gone into FMCG business.

In fact, the company has set aside an investment outlay of Rs 25,000 crore which among others looks to create Integrated Consumer Goods Manufacturing & Logistics facilities (ICMLs) for its FMCG businesses and strengthen distribution for the agriculture back end. This makes it increasingly a beneficiary of policy measures taken for food processing industry. And in this context, the federal Budget has potentially more to offer to the stock.

Risk factors to watch

Recent strong results from Godfrey Phillips and VST industries, along with ITC’s cigarettes volume growth moderation in Q1 FY20, suggest increased competitive intensity in the organised sector. However, ITC’s strong volume growth in the previous quarter (Q4 FY19) and margin expansion in Q1 FY20 for the segment implies the company is not on a weak wicket though it requires a close watch.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

We are cutting FY20 and FY21 EPS estimates of ITC by 2.1% and 3.7% following disappointing cigarette volume growth of 2.5%. We believe that coming quarters in FY20 will show low single digit volume growth given 6.5-7.5% volume growth in base quarters, and challenging consumer environment. FMCG business has reported 5.9% (up 150bps YoY) which reinforces our confidence of double digit EBIDTA margins over next 3-5 years. Although ITC is likely to face near term headwinds in demand, long term outlook looks promising given sustained innovations new launches in snacking and dairy. Paperboard business is in fine fettle given gains from steady prices and benign input costs. Hotels ARR and occupancy indicates steady improvement in profits, however we are far off from pre 2009 profitability. ITC trades at 21.5xFY21 EPS, ~40% discount to our coverage universe with 2.2% dividend yield. Risk reward remains favorable, although returns might be back ended due to poor visibility on cigarette volume growth.

Outlook

Retain ""Buy"" with SOTP based target price of Rs367 (Rs369 earlier).

HDFC Securities' research report on ITC

Cig. revenue growth missed estimates with value/volume growth of 6/3.5% (10/5.5% in FY19) vs. exp. of 9/5.5%. 5th consecutive quarter of volume growth vs. -4% CAGR over FY12-18. A high base and slowdown impacted volume growth in 1Q. Cig. EBIT grew by 8% (6.5% CAGR over FY15-19) vs. exp. of 9% growth. Cig. EBIT margins expanded by 145bps owing to (1) Price hikes (~3%) and (2) Scaling manufacturing of capsules (70% in-house by Dec-19). Margin decline in FY19 was the key concern on the street, we expect this to reverse in FY20. We expect cig EBIT CAGR of 8% over FY19-22E. Non-cig business grew by 12% (exp. 11%). FMCG biz growth of 8% was in-line vs. its peers (HUL/Dabur/Marico/Colgate 7/11/6/6%). FMCG EBITDAM expanded by 140bps to 5.9%.

Outlook

ITC’s 1Q performance was soft vs. its FY19 show but in-line with FMCG peers. We expect 1Q growth trajectory to replicate over FY20, led by higher base of cig. volume growth and consumption slowdown. We value ITC on SoTP basis (link to table) and arrive at a TP of Rs 362 (implied P/E of 28x vs. earlier assigned P/E of 32x). We de-rate cigarette business by 10% (EV/EBITDA 18x vs. 20x implied earlier) owing to slower than expected volume growth in the era of stable taxes. Maintain BUY.

Highlights:

- Cigarette volumes lower than expected; improved margins reflect recent price hikes

- FMCG business benefits from restructuring, operating leverage and mix

- Hotel performance in line with sector-wide promising trend- Operating leverage and stable cigar tax regime should help reduce valuation discount to the sector

ITC’s Q1 FY20 sales growth of 5.8 percent YoY (year on year) was lower than our expectations, but broadly in line with the traction seen for the FMCG sector. While volume growth for cigarettes was uninspiring, improved operating performance for cigarettes and FMCG segments was noteworthy.

Table: Q1 Financials

Source: Company

Key positives

Volume growth in the cigarette businesses (39 percent of Q1 sales) is estimated to be in the vicinity of 3 percent. Though this comes after a decent volume growth (7-8 percent) in the previous quarter, it signals weak traction on the demand side. However, what comes as a positive surprise is cigar operating margin has expanded by 140 bps YoY, helped by price increase to the tune of 2.5 percent. Note that margin contraction was a key concern in the previous financial year amid trend for downtrading among consumers.

FMCG sales (22 percent of total sales) grew by 8 percent YoY after excluding the impact of restructuring of Lifestyle retailing. The company highlighted that FMCG EBIT witnessed a strong move of 56 percent YoY, led by better product mix and operating leverage.

Hotels business (3 percent of sales) witnessed another strong quarter (growing 15 percent YoY) benefiting from traction in new properties (ITC Kohenur, Hyderabad, ITC Royal Bengal and ITC Grand Goa). However, additional deprecation on account of new properties impacted the segment’s earnings before interest expense and tax (EBIT).

Overall, EBITDA margin expanded by 105 bps YoY, aided by strong execution, restructuring and gross margin expansion (+180 bps).

Key negative

Though agribusiness sales expanded by 15 percent YoY, EBIT margin declined by 60 bps. The segment was impacted by weak trading opportunities in oilseeds and pulses and subdued demand for leaf tobacco in international markets.

Outlook

Cigarette volume growth moderated in the current quarter though improved operating performance was noticeable. As the cigarette business still contributes a major chunk of operating profit, it remains a segment to watch amid consumer demand slowdown and the competitive intensity.

Having said that, we believe that the thesis of broadening of growth levers for ITC remains on track. A few of ITC’s other businesses have witnessed encouraging traction in recent times: volume growth in the FMCG space and outlook in the hotel and paper business.

We are particularly enthused about operating leverage playing out for FMCG business. A back of the envelope calculation suggests that a normalisation of ITC’s FMCG business margins in line with its peers could help the conglomerate's overall EBITDA margin looking up ~250 bps, ceteris paribus.

Pls also read: ITC’s hospitality forays – the less talked about business interest of tobacco/FMCG giant

Furthermore, the stock (20 times FY21 estimated earnings) is trading at a significant discount to the FMCG sector’s trading multiple (~35-40x). We believe that this discount should narrow, given the stable tax regime for the cigarettes business and improving operating leverage in other businesses.

Shares of ITC fell 2.6 percent intraday to hit 16-month low on August 5 after company's total revenue, cigarette volume growth and FMCG business in quarter 1 didn't meet expectations.

The stock has plunged 15 percent in the last three-month to Rs 257.60, the lowest level since March 30, 2018. It was quoting at Rs 260.15, down Rs 4.45, or 1.68 percent, on the BSE at 1306 hours.

In Q1, profit grew by 12.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,173.9 crore, which was in line with analyst estimates, and revenue increased by 5.8 percent to Rs 11,502.8 crore, lower than analysts' expectations of Rs 11,565 crore.

Cigarette business, which contributed 47 percent to total revenue, showed a 6 percent YoY growth in revenue and its volume grew by 3-4 percent, far below estimates of around 5 percent. FMCG revenue growth of 6.6 percent was also below estimates of 8-10 percent for the quarter YoY.

While having overweight call on ITC with a target price at Rs 360, Morgan Stanley said Q1 results were weaker than it expected. ""Except for FMCG, EBIT growth across all business segments missed our estimate,"" it added.

Performance in cigarette business was affected by weakness in overall environment, ITC said.

HSBC also said Q1 cigarette volume growth was slightly below its expectations. While valuation undemanding, taxation path remains a key risk, it added.

The global brokerage house maintained its buy call on the stock, but slashed price target to Rs 320 from Rs 330 per share.

CLSA also remained buyer on the stock with a target price at Rs 365 per share as the stock provided attractive risk-reward.

""Double-digit growth remained elusive for company's company's cigarette business which grew 8 percent in Q1. FMCG business reported strong EBITDA growth despite moderate topline show,"" the brokerage said.

ITC shares fell over a percent intraday on July 8 after the government announced a minor increase in tax on cigarettes that contributes more than 40 percent to the company's total business.

Brokerages, however, remained positive while remaining positive on the stock. They said the increase in excise duty on cigarettes was negligible that brings stability for the time being.

The stock was quoting at Rs 276.65, down Rs 2.80, or 1.00 percent on the BSE at 1130 hours IST.

Here is what brokerages say about tax changes on cigarettes:

Credit Suisse

Overall Budget 2019 is positive for ITC as cigarette excise duty re-introduced on a technical ground and its impact is a negligible 0.2 percent hike in the current cigarette tax.

Despite fiscal needs, government desisted from hiking the overall cigarette taxes.

Cigarette tax stability is a relief for ITC and budgeted GST cess is in-line with expectation. We expect operating performance to keep improving and earnings growth is seen in the low-teens.

The overhang of a GST rate hike will remain. We maintained an outperform rating on the stock with a target price at Rs 370 per share,

Deutsche Bank

The government had demonstrated its intent to provide a stable tax change in cigarettes. Hence we believe this can aid in bringing back investor confidence and there is significant headroom for upside.

We view the stock as cheap with significant re-rating potential. We have model earnings CAGR of 15 percent over FY19-22.

Jefferies

For ITC, we are building in 10 percent tax increase in FY20.

The Budget was a positive surprise given only a nominal tax. We now await GST rate changes, if any, over next couple of months.

In case there are no changes in GST rates in FY20, it would be a significant positive for ITC. There will be a significant volume recovery and share gain if tax is not increased.

After extension of assured income support for farmers; higher fertilizer subsidy allocation

Non-farm productivity – focus on dairy and aquaculture

Companies with stable outlook to remain in focus –Marico, HUL, ITC, Britannia

Post interim Budget, earlier this year, macro backdrop and domestic consumption had further weakened, which led to a clamour for increased stimulus in terms of assured income support, higher allocation for subsidies and rural allied sectors.

Given the fiscal constraints, a substantial allocation change compared to the interim Budget was not pragmatic, but tweaks in allocation to emphasise the intent and a road map were expected. Largely on those lines, the Budget signalled “more of the same” in terms of its focus on improving the prospects for rural allied sectors.

Income support/Subsides

In the run-up to the Budget, the government had already increased its allocation for assured income support scheme for farmers. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), which was announced in the interim Budget and spoke of direct income support for marginal farmers, was extended to all farmers, from marginal ones.

So, this Budget, we expected increased support for farm subsidy schemes. Allocation for both Urea and nutrient-based subsidy has further increased as against the interim Budget.

Steady focus on food processing industries

Weak translation of MSP (Minimum Support Prices) as an effective crop buying price has emerged as a focused attention for the government. While recently there has been a moderate increase in MSP for kharif crops, the government is also taking steps so that farmers get a fair price for their produce. For this, the Union government plans to work with states to allow farmers to benefit from e-NAM (National Agriculture Market) – an online trading platform for agricultural commodities.

Furthermore, the government plans to form 10,000 new Farmer Producer Organisations, to ensure economies of scale for farmers over the next five years. These steps are expected to streamline procurement, dis-intermediation and better pricing for farmers.

In case of food processing industries, the FY20 Budget estimates on schemes for food processing are same as the interim Budget, but higher by 26 percent than the FY19 revised estimates.

Non-farm productivity – Focus on dairy and aqua

Aquaculture and dairy sectors continue to gain incremental attention as they have also been among the most stressed sector in recent times. Compared to the interim Budget, there has been a higher allocation for the dairy sector. The Budget emphasised that dairying through cooperatives will also be encouraged by creating infrastructure for cattle feed manufacturing, milk procurement, processing and marketing.

Further, under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), the Department of Fisheries would establish a robust fisheries management framework to address critical gaps in the value chain, including infrastructure, modernisation, traceability, production, productivity, post-harvest management, and quality control.

Overall, the Budget proposals have a status quo implications of the consumption revival in the near term. We believe that this brings investors focus to Q1 FY20 earnings season to assess the domestic staple demand trends.

Recent updates from the select companies – Godrej Consumer, Marico and Prataap Snacks – suggest that moderation in demand environment continues. Key offsetting factor for now is the broad-based moderation in input cost such as packaging cost, mentha oil and palm oil for consumer companies.

Going forward, quantum and spatial distribution of monsoon would be key factor to watch. We continue to prefer companies which are deploying internal accruals such as cost savings or utilising super normal profit from other product groups. ITC and Marico stand out here, where they deploy profits from cigarettes and lower copra prices, respectively, for new product categories. While there is a nominal increase in basic excise duty for tobacco products, the tax regime appears largely stable for the company. In the case of Marico, steeper correction in copra prices compared to expectations is positive. Furthermore, Marico, along with Britannia, benefits from higher exposure to urban demand, which is relatively stable.

Additionally, we believe that one should watch for companies making inorganic ventures or restructuring initiatives which open up promising sub-segments, in addition to synergistic benefit such as HUL-GSK (Health & Nutrition) and Tata Consumer Products (Food & Beverages).Follow @anubhavsays

Cigarettes manufacturer ITC, Godfrey Phillips and Golden Tobacco shares gained more than 1 percent intraday on July 5 as the government's excise duty hike on cigarettes was less than expectations.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her first Union Budget speech said the excise duty on other than filter cigarettes of length not exceeding 65 millimetres and exceeding 65 millimetres but not exceeding 70 millimetres increased to Rs 5 per thousand pieces against nil earlier.

Excise duty on filter cigarettes of length (including the length of the filter, the length of filter being 11 millimetres or its actual length, whichever is more) not exceeding 65 millimetres, exceeding 65 millimetres but not exceeding 70 millimetres and exceeding 70 millimetres but not exceeding 75 millimetres also increased by Rs 5 per thousand pieces against nil.

Indian and foreign analysts were expecting a substantial increase in excise duty on cigarette, so this is very small compared to excise duties in the US and European countries.

""Hence this increase is not very substantial against higher street expectations and in addition, there is a relief that there won't be any tax on cigarettes at least for this year,"" Shailendra Kumar, CIO at Narnolia Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

At 1451 hours IST, ITC was up 1.08 percent at Rs 280.70, Godfrey Phillips was up 0.3 percent at Rs 834.60 and Golden Tobacco gained 0.32 percent at Rs 31.60 on the BSE."

As a weekly tactical pick, we recommend ITC. The stock has sharply corrected in the last one month and currently trades at a steep discount (22 times FY21 estimated earnings) to the earnings multiple of the largecap FMCG sector (around 38 times).

This is in contrast to improving fundamentals of most businesses ITC is exposed to and the current risk-reward appears favourable. With the GST review decisions relegated to the GST Council and improving business mix towards FMCG/food processing industry, we believe the Budget has potentially more to offer.

In addition to the attractive valuation, following factors makes us constructive on the stock:

In the recent quarterly result, cigarettes volume growth (7-8 percent year-on-year) were better-than-anticipated and appear to benefit from stable taxation regime for the last 23 months.

The thesis of broadening growth levers for ITC is unfolding as expected. Few of ITC’s other businesses have witnessed encouraging growth traction in recent times: volume growth in the FMCG business (other than cigarettes) and growth outlook in the hotel and paper business.

We are enthused about the operating leverage playing out in the FMCG business in particular. In FY19, FMCG business' EBITDA grew 51 percent. A back of the envelope calculation suggest that a normalisation of ITC’s FMCG business margin, in line with peers, could help ITC’s overall EBITDA margin to perk up about 280 bps, ceteris paribus.

Capital allocation also remains pertinent. The management continues to deploy healthy operating cash flows (Rs 12,651 crore in FY19), mainly from the cigarettes business for investment across businesses (Rs 2,767 crore) in FY19. Of this, almost 50 percent of the investment has gone to the FMCG business.

In fact, the management has kept an investment outlay of Rs 25,000 crore, which among others, targets for creation of Integrated Consumer Goods Manufacturing & Logistics facilities (ICMLs) for its FMCG businesses and to strengthen distribution and the agri-backend. This makes it increasingly a beneficiary of policy measures taken for food processing industry. And in this context, the Budget has potentially more to offer to the stock.

Risk factors to watch: Acceleration in the cigarettes business downtrading; review and increase in ad valorem duty by subsequent GST Council meetings and delay in rural demand recovery.

Highlights:

Challenging macro context spells weak consumption demand

Budget likely to address income support and rural infrastructure

Avenues in agriculture allied services and direct benefit transfer (subsidy) to get attention

Companies with higher rural exposure, food processing ind. remain in focus – Dabur, HUL, ITC, Emami

When the FY20 interim budget was presented in February, the macro backdrop appeared fragile largely due to rural distress. Consumption slowdown was visible mainly for the durables and largely attributed to the liquidity crunch arising out of the crisis in the NBFC sector.

The FMCG sector was seen as a relatively shining space in the economy as staple demand in rural areas was relatively stable ahead of urban demand.

However, five months past the interim budget, macro backdrop and consumption story is strikingly worrisome. Rural demand which was about 1.3 times urban demand has petered down to 1.1 times in Q4 FY19 for prominent companies such as HUL and Dabur.

In the upcoming budget, we expect intensification of rural-focused policy measures which can perk up rural demand. Policy measures calibrated to improve farm income, avenues in agriculture and allied services, direct benefit transfer (subsidy), rural employment schemes, and income support schemes shall help in rural consumption demand. Here, we highlight few areas which sets the context for such measures.

Direct income/benefit transfer

Ways and means to increase direct income support would likely be explored particularly when other traditional means of support such as MSP (Minimum Support Scheme) have not been effective enough.

Firstly, targeting farm focused subsidy schemes could intensify. In the interim budget, there was an increase in allocation for Urea and food subsidy by 11 and 8 percent respectively. Notwithstanding the news flow that part of the subsidy allocation particularly for petroleum was carried over from FY19 to FY20, there could be step up in allocation due to proven efficiency of direct benefit transfer.

Chart: Budget allocation for Subsidies (Rs. Crore)

Source: http://www.indiabudget.gov.in

Secondly, in the interim budget, assured income support for marginal farmers (Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) was announced which amounts to direct income support of Rs 6000 / year per person. Earlier targeted for 12 crore small and marginal farmers having a land holding up to 2 hectares, this scheme under recent extension is applicable for all farmers. Thus the estimates for this scheme are now Rs 87,000 crore vs. earlier Rs 75,000 crore for FY20. There is an expectation for further expansion in the scope of scheme in terms of per capita income support.

Steady focus on food processing industries

One of the reason behind weak translation of MSP as an effective crop buying price is the inadequate infrastructure. We believe that there would be higher allocation for the food processing value chain which starts from a justified procurement policy to an enabling environment for food processing. Last year, budget allocation for the food and distribution department had a 75 percent increase compared to FY18 actuals.

FY19 revised estimates were in fact higher than that of budget estimates which means intended expenditure had been on track. In FY20 budget estimates, it was further increased by 7 percent with a focus for Cold storage chain. Further, FY20 budget estimates for schemes of food processing has been higher by 26 percent from the FY19 revised estimates.

Non-farm productivity – much desired

Other aspect of interim budget allocation which was disappointing compared to last year’s budget estimates was the agriculture allied sector. We expect higher emphasis for aquaculture and dairy sectors which have also been one of the most stressed sector in recent times.

We may also witness further impetus for rural infrastructure in the form of digital villages. As per last update, Government targets for 1,00,000 digital villages which would be connected through Wi-Fi and assist residents in entrepreneurship opportunities such as setting up cottage industries.

Given the subdued demand scenario, wish list for budget expectations could be much longer. However, fiscal constraints puts a cap on what can pragmatically be achieved. Further, there are challenges with respect to resource mobilization.

While GST collections are lower than expected, potential leeway given to the US on account of trade negotiation can further dent the indirect tax collections. We may see non-traditional avenues of resource mobilization which includes and not limited to acceleration in disinvestment targets.

Having said that, political and economic onus on government is high with respect to the need to revive rural economy. And hence, we might see targeted allocation which are more efficient. In this context, companies such as Dabur, Emami and HUL which have 40-50% sales from the rural economy should benefit. Further, companies exposed to food processing industry such as ITC, Prataap Snacks and Parag Milk should also be kept under watch.Follow @anubhavsays

Goldman Sachs is of the view that the consumer sector has seen the most widespread deceleration in the last 10 years. FY20 started off on a weaker footing than any year in the recent past with a tepid outlook for the near-term consumption.

However, the global investment bank has three buy and sell ideas for FY20 amid tough macro demand. The global investment bank has put Avenue Supermarts and ITC to 'Buy' list but downgraded Dabur India to 'Sell'.

The global investment bank believes that buy ideas that include companies like Avenue Supermarts, ITC, Colgate Palmolive and Page Industries have tailwinds that insulate them from macro demand headwinds and are not yet factored into their valuations.

At the same time, its top sell ideas include Marico, Jubilant Foodworks, Dabur and Hindustan Unilever that have risks to growth that are currently not priced in.

According to Goldman, the March quarter results from consumption sector saw a slowdown in domestic revenue growth across India consumer coverage, with each of the 17 companies seeing sales growth decelerate on a year-on-year basis.

“This is the first quarter in 10 years that has seen every company in our coverage witness domestic revenue growth decelerate,” said the Goldman Sach report.

Management attributed the deceleration in demand to slower rural income growth, disruption due to general elections, liquidity constraints for the channel and a tougher base for GST-led market share gains for organised players.

Goldman Sachs expects the trend to continue for at least the next two quarters as benefits of any government measures to revive rural demand will take time to reflect in demand.

The global investment bank expects a growth in sales from 4QFY20E partly driven by softer comps.

In terms of valuations, consumer stocks have corrected from their mid-2018 peak, but remain 24 percent above the 10-year coverage average, Goldman said. For consumer staples, excluding ITC, multiples are 38 percent above the 10-year average and 12 percent above the 5-year average.

“We run a bear-case scenario, where we assume FY20 growth will continue on the trends seen in 4QFY19 and growth in FY21/FY22 will be similar to the lacklustre growth seen in FY15-18. Under this scenario, on average, we see our FY20/FY21 EPS being cut by 3/6 percent and our valuation having further downside of 13 percent,” said the report.

Goldman Sachs’s three ideas for a weak demand environment:

Avenue Supermarts: Target: Rs 1,740| LTP: Rs 1,340| Upside: 30 percent

Goldman Sachs added Avenue Supermarts back to the Conviction List for three main reasons. First, Avenue is likely to surprise investors on store additions. Investors have been concerned about Avenue new store additions, which missed expectations in FY19.

However, management was categorical about the company being well-positioned to accelerate store adds, with the delay in FY19 being due to regulatory factors.

Secondly, the company has significant room to grow SSSG through an increase in throughput per sqft or by increasing store area in areas where the cost of real estate is lower; and lastly, margin reset largely behind us.

Third, Avenue remains competitive on pricing while delivering strong returns. Its low-cost model is far more resilient to pricing-led competition than some peers with significantly higher operating costs.

ITC: Target: Rs 315| LTP: Rs 275| Upside: 14 percent

Goldman Sachs turns positive on ITC for three reasons: (1) Moderate tax increase can spurt cigarette EBIT acceleration, (2) FMCG (others) poised to see better profitability as the business gains scale; and (3) valuations are un-demanding relative to domestic consumer peers in an environment that could see EBIT growth accelerate.

The initial underperformance was a function of a decline in cigarette volume driven by very sharp tax increases. In FY19, ITC missed expectations despite an improvement in cigarette volume growth as EBIT growth missed expectations.

Dabur India: Sell| Target: Rs 334| LTP: Rs 387| Downside: 13 percent

Goldman Sachs downgraded Dabur to sell primarily because of two main reasons. Firstly, three key segments for Dabur such as juices, hair care and oral care are seeing heightened competition.

And, secondly, significant exposure to rural India, which has seen challenges to consumption growth driven by a slowdown in wages for both agricultural and non-agricultural labour.

Dabur India has amongst the highest exposure to rural India for its domestic business.

Hotel major ITC June 18 sought waiver of the norms regarding minority shareholders in its case against Hotel Leela Venture in which it owns less than the mandated 10 percent.

The ITC counsel told the tribunal comprising VP Singh and R Duraisamy that as of now they hold only 8.72 percent in Hotel Leelaventure, which Canadian private equity fund Brookfield has agreed to take over for Rs 3,950 crore but that was because a part of its shareholding was converted into equity after the banks sold their loans to JM Financial ARC, which did the debt-equity conversion.

The Company Act provisions recongnise only those with 10 percent or more non-promoters as minority shareholders.

Before JM Financial ARC converted its debt into equity, ITC had held 11.78 percent in the rival hotel company, which has been in financial crisis for long now. Brookfield, the promoters along with JM Financial ARC, which owns 26 percent after debt conversion, are proposing to sell 96.8 percent of the company.

After the sale, ITC alleged that large amounts will be paid to the promoters and JM Financial ARC will also benefit from the deal but the company will not receive any value.

Since other minority shareholders have very low shareholding in Leela now, they don't have the capacity to maintain a petition of oppression and mismanagement, therefore, ITC filed the case, it argued.

He said, ITC wants a waiver of the minimum 10 percent shareholding requirement clause for any minority shareholder to file a petition for oppression and miss-management against the management. And if Sebi decides to give a go ahead to the deal, they can fight the case on its merit in NCLT, he added.

To this, the Leela counsel said this is a grossly motivated and mala-fide move of a business rival which is trying to kill competition by taking over the company.

The value of their shareholding is negative as of now and they knew about the corporate debt restructuring scheme and JM's conversion of debt to equity but didn't oppose it as they abstained from voting on those issues, he added.

The tribunal will continue to hear the matter Wednesday.

Earlier ITC and LIC, which owns 2 percent in Leela had moved the Sebi seeking to stay the deal with Brookfield saying the Rs 3,950-crore will leave the holding company a skeleton as deal involves selling all the four key properties of Leela in Delhi, Udaipur Chennai and Bengaluru, and land parcel in Agra leaving only the Mumbai property, which anyway is under dispute with the Airports Authority over land ownership.

Following this, Sebi asked Leela and JM Financial ARC to put the deal, announced on March 18, on hold."

ITC shares fell 0.4 percent intraday on June 17 after global brokerage house CLSA slashed price target on lower cigarette multiple.

""We see a decline in free cash flow and marginal improvement in return ratios in 2018-19,"" the research firm said. It added that concerns about tobacco business are still there but FMCG has ramped-up well.

CLSA said it lowered cigarette business valuation multiple given lack of earnings growth visibility, hence it slashed price target on the stock to Rs 365 from Rs 400 earlier while maintaining buy call as risk-reward is attractive.

""We lower cigarette multiple from 27x to 24x for FY21, though cigarette business' return on capital employed continued to rise to an astonishing level,"" it said.

The company has launched the model for sustainable management of MLP waste on an end-to-end basis in partnership with SWaCH and the Pune civic body, an official release said.

In the first phase, ITC-SWaCH-PMC will operate one processing facility with a capacity to manage 200 metric tonne of MLP waste per month, providing an opportunity to 3,500 such collectors, it said.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Tuesday directed market regulator Sebi to conclude its probe into allegations against Hotel Leela Venture by the company's two minority shareholders ITC and LIC.

The NCLT's Mumbai bench comprising V P Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy said the regulator should conclude its examination on the matter before the next date of hearing, on July 8.

Earlier in April, ITC had sought a waiver of the 10 per cent minimum shareholding requirement to file a petition alleging oppression and mismanagement against the hotel management and its lender JM Financial ARC and also to prevent the premium hotel chain from going ahead with the ongoing sale to Canadian fund house Brookfield for Rs 3,950 crore that was announced in March.

""We were suppressed of our rights as a shareholder. The postal ballot notice has not addressed many issues. It is a classic case of majority acting against minority shareholders using oppressive means, as they own 73 per cent.

""We want protection for our shareholding so that the promoters cannot get away with a fraudulent deal,"" the ITC counsel had told the tribunal.

He noted that in 2017, JM Financial ARC bought the debt of Hotel Leela from banks and got 26 per cent shareholding after converting the debt into equity. This led to the dilution of ITC's shareholding to below 10 per cent, J Khambatta argued.

As per the information available with the bourses, ITC holds 7.92 per cent stake in Hotel Leelaventure as of the December 2018 quarter.

Under Section 241 of the Companies Act, 2013, a minimum shareholding of 10 per cent is required to file such cases.

The tribunal had issued notices JM Financial and Hotel Leelaventure to reply within three weeks and file rejoinders in two weeks thereafter.

ITC said all major hotels of Hotel Leelaventure are being sold off excluding the flagship Mumbai property, which is facing a legal battle with the Airports Authority over land lease, and also a land parcel in Hyderabad, which the hotel group is developing with Prestige Developers.

Under the deal with Brookfield, the Leela promoters will get over Rs 300 crore from the buyer under royalty and management consultancy agreements for the next five years.

""We are seeking deal details or the valuation report but the company is not co-operating,"" the ITC counsel had added.

The Securities and Exchange Board in a letter to Hotel Leelaventure had said it has received representations from ITC apart from Life Insurance Corporation.

Earlier on March 18, Brookfield had agreed to acquire four hotels in New Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and Udaipur, and a land parcel in Agra from Hotel Leelaventure for Rs 3,950 crore. The deal is yet to go through. The flagship Mumbai property is not part of the deal and together these five hotels have over 1,400 rooms.

JM Financial ARC had filed insolvency application against the Mumbai-based hotel chain in January, which owes around Rs 5,900 crore to lenders.

The Brookfield-Leela deal will also entail buying the Leela brand, existing and all its upcoming management contracts apart from absorbing the employees of these four hotels being taken over by the Canadian fund."

Dolat Capital's research report on ITC

ITC’s Q4FY19 results were marginally ahead of our estimates. The cigarette business posted +9% volume growth, which was ahead of our estimate of 7%. However, decline in margins in the cigarette business is a cause for concern. Despite sluggish demand in Q4, ITC’s FMCG business delivered 7.3% increase in top-line and 100bps expansion in margin, was encouraging. We have maintained our FY20E and FY21E EPS estimates at ` 11.2 and ` 12.2, respectively. In our view, the stock is trading at a steep discount to peers and is an attractive bet.

Outlook

We value the stock at 26x PE, to arrive at a TP of ` 320. Maintain Buy. In volatile market conditions we believe that there would be some pressure on stock. Nevertheless, in the long run we maintain positive view on ITC.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC reported yet another steady quarter with ~7.5% cigarette volume growth and sustained expansion in margins across FMCG and Paperboards business. Cigarette demand outlook remains positive, sans any sharp increase in GST rates in coming months. FMCG business faces near term demand headwinds, however long term trajectory of double digit topline growth, category expansion and steady increase in margins looks intact (108bps EBIT margin expansion in FY19, target of double digit margins in 5 years) post restructuring of lifestyle retailing business. Paperboard business is in fine fettle given gains from steady prices and benign input costs. Hotels ARR and occupancy indicates steady improvement in profits, however we are far off from pre 2009 profitability. ITC trades at 22.7xFY21 EPS, 35-40% discount to our coverage universe and 2% dividend yield limits downside in the stock.

Outlook

We believe that stable cigarette taxation regime can re-rate the stock. Retain ""Buy"" with SOTP based target price of Rs369 (Rs364 earlier).

HDFC Securities' research report on ITC

Cig. revenue growth beat estimates with value/volume growth of 11/8.5% (10/5.5% in FY19) vs. exp. of 9/7%. In FY19, cig. volume growth was the fastest since FY11. We model 4.6/4% volume growth in FY20/21E. Cig. EBIT grew by 10% (fastest in 12 quarters) vs. exp. of 9%. Cig. EBIT margins were under pressure owing to (a) Higher share of capsule cigs (scaling manufacturing; 100% in-house by Mar-21) and (b) Gradual price hikes to pass on RM inflation. We expect cig. EBIT to grow by 10% over FY20-21E. All non-cig segments fired in 4Q with overall portfolio growing at 15% (vs. exp of 13.5%). ITC’s FMCG biz (adjusting for restructuring in retail) outperformed the FMCG sector in 4Q with 12% growth (HUL/Britannia/Dabur/Marico clocked 9/10/6/7% growth). FMCG EBIT margins (adj. for one-offs) expanded by 100bps to 4% (all time-high). Post restructuring of retail biz, we expect FMCG margin (optically) to improve in the near-term.

Outlook

ITC’s 4Q/FY19 performance was robust vs. its delivery over FY15-18. Cigarette volume growth has returned owing to a stable tax regime, which validates our thesis that ITC’s performance will improve as affordability returns. We aren’t too perturbed with near term margin pressure, as cigarette biz commands the highest margins across industries (volumes matter). We maintain BUY and value ITC on FY21E EPS at 32x, arriving at a TP of Rs 398.

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

ITC registered mixed performance in Q4FY2019 with revenue growing by a strong 13%, while the 87 bps decline in OPM limited growth in operating profit to 10.3%. Revenue from cigarette grew by ~11%, driven by 8-9% volume growth, PBIT margins were down by 77 bps largely due to a largely unfavourable revenue mix. Growth in cigarette sales volumes to sustain in near term on minimal price hikes; paperboard, paper & packaging and hotel businesses would keep growing in double digits.

Outlook

-------------------------------------------------

ITC’s Q4 FY19 operating sales grew 13.3 percent year-on-year led by double-digit topline growth for all segments.

Result snapshot

Source: Company

Key positivesBetter-than-expected volume growth in the cigarette businesses, which constitutes 43 percent of sales, was the key positive. Volume growth is estimated to be in the 7-8 percent range and partially benefits from a stable Goods & Service Tax (GST) rates. However, operating margin were a tad weaker due to adverse product mix and higher cost of leaf tobacco.

FMCG sales (25 percent of sales) grew 10 percent YoY after excluding the impact of restructuring of lifestyle retailing and education and stationery products businesses. The management highlighted that EBITDA margin for the FMCG business is seven percent compared to 5.7 percent in Q4 FY18. Though this is still long way from the frontline FMCG benchmarks, it is fast improving. Absolute segmental EBITDA increased 31 percent YoY driven by enhanced scale and better product mix.

Hotels business (four percent of sales) saw a steady improvement in sales, benefiting from higher occupancy, increase in room rates and higher food and beverage revenue. Operations at the recently commissioned hotels -- ITC Kohenur, Hyderabad (commissioned in Q1 FY19) and ITC Grand Goa (possession granted in October last year) -- were scaled up. The company updated on the steady progress in the construction of ITC Hotels at Kolkata and Ahmedabad. Construction of ITC Royal Bengal in Kolkata is nearing completion and is expected to be commissioned in Q1 FY20.

Segmental performance

Source: Company

Key negativesOverall EBITDA margin contracted 103 basis points (100 bps=1 percentage point) on account of higher cost of goods sold and employee cost offsetting moderate increase in other expenses. Segmental margin in the cigarette and hotels businesses were lower than last year, while there was a significant improvement in margin for the FMCG and paperboard businesses.

The management reiterated the observation of FMCG peers that consumption space has slowed down and there is sluggish demand in the rural areas.

Other observationsIn the agribusiness (16 percent of sales), the company has strengthened its milk procurement network for Aashirvaad Svasti dairy products, with significant increase in daily milk collection. In recent times, the company has expanded its milk sourcing network to Kolkata for fresh dairy products and to Punjab for meeting the requirement of dairy beverages under the brand Sunfeast Wonderz. The company has recently augmented the dairy category from milk to dairy products – curd, paneer, milkshakes and ghee.

The management is gradually shifting its focus towards branded products in the agribusiness. Branded frozen prawns and packaged frozen snacks are some of the recent additions in these high value-added segments.

It must be noted that the Q4 result also includes net gain on restructuring of the lifestyle retailing business comprising sale proceeds of John Players trademark/copyright amounting to Rs 70.5 crore.

OutlookWhile cigarettes volume trend is better-than-anticipated, a possible trend for downtrading needs a close watch as the recovery is in a fragile phase. Also, we take solace from the fact that the fiscal/taxation side of the cigarettes business has likely stabilised.

We believe that the thesis of broadening of growth levers for ITC is unfolding as expected. Few of ITC’s other businesses have witnessed encouraging growth traction in recent times: volume growth in the FMCG business and growth outlook in the hotel and paper business. We are as well enthused about operating leverage playing out for FMCG business in particular.

A back of the envelope calculation suggest that a normalisation of ITC’s FMCG business margin in line with peers could help ITC’s overall EBITDA margin perk up around 280 bps, ceteris paribus.

We view the appointment of Sanjiv Puri (current Managing Director) as Chairman takes away any worries with respect to succession planning.

The stock is currently trading at a significant discount (24.5 times FY20 estimated price-to-earnings) to the FMCG sector’s trading multiple of around 40 times FY20 estimated P/E. Given this context, we remain constructive on the stock.

ITC’s Q4 operating sales grew 13.3 percent YoY (year on year), buoyed by strong top line growth across segments. A key takeaway is better than expected volume growth in the cigarette business, which is estimated at 7-8 percent.

EBITDA margins, however, contracted by 103 bps on account of higher cost of goods sold and rise in employee costs.

Segmental margins in cigarette and hotels businesses were lower than last year while there was a significant improvement in margins for FMCG (others) and paperboard business. The company highlighted that FMCG (others) EBITDA margin is 7 percent as against 5.7 percent in Q4 FY18 – still a long way off the frontline FMCG benchmarks, but fast improving.

While net profit has grown nearly 19 percent, this includes a net gain on restructuring of the Lifestyle retailing business, consisting of sale proceeds of John Players trademark/copyright amounting to Rs 70.5 crore.

The decision was taken today when the board met to review its results for the quarter ended March 31.

Puri was appointed as chief executive officer (CEO) in 2017, and as Managing Director in 2018. He also heads ITC's corporate management committee.

He had joined ITC in 1986, and is an alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, and Wharton School of Business.

Puri has also held the role of chief operating officer (COO), and headed ITC’s FMCG, paperboards, paper and packaging and agri-businesses before that.

Long stint

In 2018, ITC’s board extended Deveshwar's tenure as a non-executive chairman till 2022 so that he could groom Puri.

Deveshwar was appointed as a director on the board of the company on April 11, 1984, and became the chief executive and chairman of the board on January 1, 1996.

He was one of India's longest-serving corporate chiefs with over two decades at the helm as the executive chairman and chief executive officer at ITC until February 4, 2017.

After the company split the role of the executive chairman between chairman and chief executive officer on February 5, 2017, Deveshwar agreed to continue as chairman in a non-executive capacity at the request of the nomination and compensation committee and the board. He also played the role of a mentor to executive management.

Between 1991 and 1994, Deveshwar led Air India as Chairman and Managing Director."

With just days to go for the Lok Sabha polls in Delhi, restaurateurs in the national capital hope the new government will work to revive the eating-out sector, which took a hit following the sealing of rooftop operations.

Reintroduction of input tax credit (ITC), eased licensing norms, a clear policy for the sector, and bringing down the legal drinking age to 18 are some other things that the industry hopes for.

Restaurateurs said their profits slumped after civic bodies sealed portions of restaurants in commercial hubs of Connaught Place, Khan Market and Hauz Khas Village in 2017 for running rooftop operations.

Priyank Sukhija, who owns restaurants like Lord of the Drinks and Warehouse Cafe in Connaught Place, claimed the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) action led to a 40 percent decline in business of restaurants in the area.

""There was a time when CP was becoming a hub for restaurants but now no new restaurants are coming up here. The crowd is there but restaurateurs do not want to venture into CP,"" he said.

""I had to sack 150 people across six of my restaurants in CP after the rooftops were closed by NDMC. We have given stability certificates to NDMC but we have been bearing the brunt since a portion of a building in C block, above Jain Book Depot, caved in,"" he added.

Like Connaught Place, restaurants in Khan Market also bore the brunt of sealing.

Business of restaurants in Hauz Khas Village was also hit by sealing of rooftop operations, multiple raids, parking issues, lack of fire safety measures and traffic congestion.

The government's decision to scrap ITC in November 2017 dealt another blow to the sector. It was accompanied by a cut in Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 18 to 5 per cent for restaurants.

Owner of QBA, a resto-bar in Connaught Place, Atul Kapur, said, reintroduction of ITC is one of the central issues for restaurateurs.

""Unlike other businesses, we pay GST but do not get input tax credit, which pushes our costs higher. The issue has been taken up with the government but nothing has been done yet,"" he said.

Sukhija echoed similar sentiments.

""Even five-star hotels are getting input tax credit but we are not getting it. I am putting my money through cheques, which means I am at a loss, while those who are functioning entirely through cash are safe. We have made numerous appeals to the GST Council but our appeals have fallen on deaf ears,"" he said.

Before the introduction of GST, those buying goods for their businesses had to pay input tax and they were also supposed to pay output tax while selling them.

The ITC mechanism was introduced to avoid double tax payment. Under the mechanism, the tax paid on input was deducted from the tax payable on output.

President of the National Restaurant Association of India, Rahul Singh, said there should be two GST slabs.

""Restaurants should have the option of choosing from two GST slabs -- the present five per cent without ITC or 12 per cent with ITC. If the option of two slabs is not possible, then ITC should at least be permitted on rent. Liquor should be brought under the ambit of GST and not doing so defeats the very purpose of bringing in a uniform single (tax) structure,"" he said.

Restaurant owners also want a clear and fixed policy for governing the sector.

""We strongly believe that whatever law is made should be followed and it should not keep changing. There has to be a stable policy about everything and there has to be clarity on each point about what the norms are and what needs to be followed how,"" said Kabir Suri, founder of dining chain operator Azure Hospitality Group, which runs Mamagoto restaurants.

""Delhi being a Union Territory remains no man's land, police reports to the Centre but the excise department reports to the state government. What needs to be done from where becomes an issue for us,"" he added.

Sukhija said the process of getting a license can take several months to be completed.

Joy Singh, owner of Raasta, which was earlier located in Hauz Khas and shifted to Green Park over a year ago, said a single license window would help the restaurant industry.

Speaking about the legal drinking age in India, Kapur said lowering it has been a long-pending demand of the industry.

He pointed out that in many foreign countries the legal drinking age is 17 or 18.

According to the current norms in India, any restaurant selling alcohol to a person below the age of 25 can lose its license."

The company will begin by exporting its packaged badam milkshakes to Dubai and Saudi Arabia and gradually enter other global markets.

Speaking about market share, Singhal said the company aims to capture 5-10 percent of the packaged milkshake market in the first year of launching its dairy business pan-India. The size of the packaged milkshake segment is Rs 1,000 crore

ITC Dairy and Beverages was set up four years ago and currently has 9-10 percent market share in the beverages sector that is roughly worth Rs 2,000 crore.

Singal also spoke about plans to scale up the dairy business in India, where they have made an entry in Kolkata and Bihar selling milk and curd. The company is eyeing more geographies to grow further, he said.

Indicating a strong presence in the online space, Singhal said e-commerce is 2 percent of ITC Foods overall business and is growing at 100 percent.

Edited excerpts:

Q: In terms of contribution to ITC Foods, how does the dairy and beverage segment fare?

A: This is a new business created four years back, growing at a double-digit rate. We have a 9-10 percent market share. It is a small but growing contribution to the business.

Q: 9-10 percent market share is only from the beverages?

A: Within the overall beverage space, we have 9-10 percent market share from the industry size which is around Rs 2,000 crore.

Q: Which is the biggest geography for you?

A: We acquired Balan Natural Foods based in Bangalore. So for us the biggest geography is south, followed by north, west and east.

Q: What is the revenue target set for the dairy and beverage segment?

A: The investment is large. It is equal to the turnover. We have invested around Rs 1,500 crore for our Kapurthala plant. We are building our business. Right now it is a small part of our business but we hope we will have a healthy growth.

Q: Are you also looking at launching vegetable juices after fruit juices?

A: Yes, in a month's time we will be launching vegetable juices without sugar added to it, which will be available in PET bottles.

Q: Would you be planning to launch sugar-free variants of fruit juices as well?

A: We can. The fact is that you need to add a certain solid matter in the juice. FSSAI, the governing body of fruit products says there should be some solid percentage in a juice. 100 percent juice sold in the market by our competitors doesn’t have added sugar but natural sugar.

We have pomegranate juice without sugar. So we can develop Stevia based products but children will not drink it. Some adults may drink it but once in a while and it will be a challenge to come up with a tasty product.

Q: What other launches can we expect in FY20?

A: Right now, in the dairy and beverages segment we have launched B Natural Juices in PET bottles in three flavours. We are also going to extend our dairy beverages. The range of four differentiated milkshakes is superior to what is available in the market. We plan to extend that in the next few months to across the country.

Parallel to that, we are also looking to scale up our dairy business. We have made a small entry in the fresh dairy segment in Kolkata and in Bihar where we have milk and curd. We are looking to increase geographies and grow further.

Q: Which countries would you be looking to export?

A: We are looking at exporting to Dubai and Saudi Arabia, where the significant Kerala population is fond of dry-fruit based milkshakes. We are planning export Badam milkshake in those markets.

Q: Would your products be available on e-commerce platforms as well?

A: Aashirwad ghee is available in four states so people buy it from Amazon. On Amazon, it is one of the best selling ghee. E-commerce is 2 percent of ITC Foods overall business and is growing at 100 percent."

ITC and Patanjali Ayurved are being investigated by the profiteering watchdog for not passing on the benefits of lower goods and services tax (GST) to consumers, as per a report in Business Standard.

Procter and Gamble (P&G), Johnson & Johnson (J&J), Samsung and other companies are already being investigated, and most of them have denied the charges.

""We are simply asking firms whether they were able to pass on the rate reduction benefit to consumers and if not, how much was the profiteered amount according to them. All companies are fully cooperating with us,"" a government official told the paper.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

In November 2019, the GST Council had cut tax on several fast moving consumer goods (FMCGs) such a washing powder, shampoo, cosmetics, and dental hygiene products to 18 percent from 28 percent.

ITC told the paper that it received a notice from the Directorate General of Anti-Profiteering (DGAP), adding that it is providing the necessary information to the authority.

The DGAP said that as of August 2018, Patanjali profiteered almost Rs 176 crore on several (FMCGs), the report added.

""We are now extending our investigation to check further profiteering by Patanjali till March 2019,"" a government official told the paper.

P&G and J&J are both facing investigations for profiteering in the sanitary napkins segment. The GST Council had exempted sanitary napkins from the tax in July 2018."

Highlights:

- Other than Hotel Leela, ITC has a significant stake in EIH

- ITC commands around 15 percent share in premium segment of the hotel industry

- Improving occupancy rates and average revenue per room point towards an upturn in the business cycle

- Asset light model appears key to improve Return on Capital Employed

-------------------------------------------------

Hotel Leelaventure’s Rs 3,950 crore asset sale to Canada's Brookfield Asset Management has run into a roadblock with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) putting the transaction on hold after a complaint by minority shareholder ITC. The tobacco giant, which owns 7.9 percent in Hotel Leela, has alleged that rules on valuation and related-party transactions were not followed. At this point, it is not clear if ITC’s motive is to protect the value of its investment, or if it is interested in outbidding Brookfield.

In fact, ITC’s investment interest in this area is well known. In the past, it has invested in EIH, whose revenues are almost as much as what ITC earns from its hotel business. Along with its subsidiary Russell Credit, ITC owns 16.13 percent in EIH. At one point, it did appear that ITC would make a hostile bid for EIH. Perhaps sensing that, the promoters of EIH brought in Reliance Industries as a white knight way back in 2010.

Today, RIL owns 18.5 percent stake in EIH through its subsidiary, and it will be difficult for ITC to make a hostile bid for EIH.

Given ITC’s latent ambitions, it is pertinent to look at ITC’s standing in the hotels business.

Where does it stand?Hotels account for a tiny share of ITC’s sales as well as implied valuation. But within the hotel industry, ITC is the second-largest chain in India.

Source: Moneycontrol Research, Company

ITC has an inventory of about 10,000 rooms, which is second only to Indian Hotels. According to numbers put out by the company, domestic industry has an availability of 66,000 rooms in the luxury and upscale segments, implying 10-15 percent market share for ITC in the premium category.

It has about 106 properties with a skew towards luxury hotels through brands ITC Hotels, WelcomHeritage Hotels and WelcomHotel. In FY19, two new properties were commissioned - ITC Kohenur and ITC Grand Goa Resort & Spa. The company is working on construction of five more - ITC Hotels at Kolkata and Ahmedabad and WelcomHotel in Amritsar, Guntur and Bhubaneswar.

Over the years, a big chunk (around 24 percent) of total capex at the company level has gone into the hotel business. In the last six years, ITC has allocated about Rs 4,000 crore as capex to this industry.

Source: Company, Moneycontrol Research

What makes this industry important now?ITC’s industry position and scrambling for additional inventory lead us to a question: Is it worth the investment? The answer lies in multiple tailwinds in action.

In recent years, demand — from domestic as well as foreign tourists -- has been rising. Various policy measures have facilitated this, which includes public services (e-visa facility) and infrastructure (air/road -connectivity). While supply of hotel rooms had been growing by around 10 percent CAGR for the last 10 years, demand is now expected to be tad higher and expected to bridge the demand-supply gap.

Consequently, occupancy rates are already firming up. Occupancy rates, which had peaked in FY07 to 72 percent, slumped to 58 percent by the FY13. In recent years, this has firmed to 67 percent, implying an industry-wide upcycle in business. In the last two fiscals, there has been an improvement in average revenue per room (ARR), which provides more credence to the upturn in business cycle.

However, ARR improvement has been rather flattish (around two percent annually). But when compared to around 20 percent CAGR during the last upcycle in 2005-08, the potential appears huge. Another way to look at it in the FY07 and FY08, EBITDA margin in the ITC’s hotel segment was about 43 percent each – almost double that of today.

What is the key challenge?The company’s unique business model makes it an interesting play in the hospitality business. A relatively capital intensive business, in case of ITC, gets funded through the cash flows from the cigarettes business and hence is debt free unlike its peers. Strong positioning in the food & beverage part of the hotel segment helps in additional flow of revenue to the company.

Source: Moneycontrol Research, Company

The challenge for ITC is the low return on capital employed (RoCE) in this business compared to peers. High capital expenditure over the years is the key culprit.

In fact, the industry is increasingly moving towards an asset-light model, where companies look for management contracts instead of owning the property. Failure to adopt this trend led to the current plight for Hotel Leela.

Industry-wide share of managed contracts ranges from 25 percent to 60 percent. ITC has also gradually adopted it and currently earns 40 percent revenue from managed contracts and the balance from owned property. It plans to change this mix to 50:50 in the next few years. This should also help in lowering capex intensity in this segment.

Along with the turn in business cycle, this should lead to expansion in RoCE for the company. Seen in this context, the company might continue to hunt for value opportunities for investing capital.

Not a long time back, ITC bought Park Hyatt Goa Resort for Rs 541 crore during an auction under The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act. Interestingly, the previous owners of Park Hyatt had contested that valuation should have been about Rs 1,200 crore.

Though the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) was keen to admit the petition of the tobaccos-to-hotels group ITC, which owns 7.92 percent in Leela, it did not do so citing procedural issues and decided to put the plea off to June 18.

It can be noted that the 10 percent minimum shareholding is defined under Section 241 of the Companies Act, 2013. There was a similar petition by Cyrus Mistry also against the Tatas after he was sacked as the group chairman in 2016, but the plea was dismissed by the Mumbai tribunal.

ITC is seeking a waiver of the 10 percent minimum shareholding requirement to file a petition alleging oppression and mismanagement against the hotel management and its lender JM Financial ARC and also to prevent the premium hotel chain from going ahead with the ongoing sale to Canadian fund house Brookfield for Rs 3,950 crore announced in March.

""We were suppressed of our rights as a shareholder. The postal ballot notice has not addressed many issues. It is a classic case of majority acting against minority shareholders using oppressive means, as they own 73 percent. ""We want protection for our shareholding so that the promoters cannot get away with a fraudulent deal,"" the ITC counsel Darius J Khambatta told the tribunal.

He noted that in 2017, JM Financial ARC bought the debt of Hotel Leela from banks and got 26 percent shareholding after converting the debt into equity. This led to the dilution of ITC's shareholding to below 10 percent, J Khambatta argued.

As per the information available with the bourses, ITC holds 7.92 percent stake in Hotel Leelaventure as of the December 2018 quarter.

Under Section 241 of the Companies Act, 2013 a minimum shareholding of 10 percent is required to file such cases.

The Mumbai bench of the NCLT comprising VP Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy issued notices JM Financial and Hotel Leelaventure to reply within three weeks and file rejoinders in two weeks thereafter.

ITC said all major hotels of Hotel Leelaventure are being sold off excluding the flagship Mumbai property, which is facing a legal battle with the Airports Authority over land lease, and also a land parcel in Hyderabad which the hotel group is developing with Prestige Developers.

Under the deal with Brookfield, the Leela promoters will get over Rs 300 crore from the buyer under royalty and management consultancy agreements for the next five years.

""We are seeking deal details or the valuation report but the company is not co-operating,"" Khambatta added.

Meanwhile, Brookfield Asset Management Company also filed an application to be made a party to the dispute. Its counsel said, they will file an intervention application if they are not made a party to current petition.

In another development, Leelaventure in a BSE filing Wednesday said markets regulator Sebi has asked it to hold the sale of its four hotels and other assets to Brookfield.

The Securities and Exchange Board in a letter to Hotel Leelaventure said it has received representations from ITC apart from Life Insurance Corporation.

Earlier on March 18, Brookfield had agreed to acquire four hotels in New Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and Udaipur, and a land parcel in Agra from Hotel Leelaventure for Rs 3,950 crore. The deal is yet to go through. The flagship Mumbai property is not part of the deal and together these five hotels have over 1,400 rooms.

JM Financial ARC had filed insolvency application against the Mumbai-based hotel chain in January, which owes around Rs 5,900 crore to lenders.

The Brookfield-Leela deal will also entail buying the Leela brand, existing and all its upcoming management contracts apart from absorbing the employees of these four hotels being taken over by the Canadian fund."

ITC's current plea was mentioned before the Mumbai bench of the NCLT, which has posted the matter for hearing tomorrow, Hotel Leelaventure said in a regulatory filing.

ITC, along with the petition has also filed two application seeking waiver of the requirement of minimum threshold of 10 percent shareholding, it added.

As per the latest information available on bourses, ITC holds a total of 7.92 percent share stake in Hotel Leelaventure.

As much as 75 cash-rich companies in the BSE 500 index can distribute a whopping Rs 1.1 lakh crore to their shareholders as dividend or buyback, finds an industry report.

The findings by advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services India (Iias), is based on FY18 financial statements of the BSE 500 companies.

In its 2018 study, based on FY17 financials, the proxy advisory firm has identified 92 companies that can pay incremental dividends of Rs 34,000 crore.

""This Rs 1.1 lakh crore equals the aggregate post-tax profit reported by 75 companies and is in addition to the Rs 62,100 crore they had paid out in FY18 as dividend,"" the report said.

The excess cash, if distributed, translates to a median dividend yield to 5.2 percent, significantly higher than the current 1.4 percent, it said.

Five of these 75 companies, are sitting on much excess cash it translates into an additional dividend yield of over 15 percent--Indian Energy Exchange, MOIL, Multi-Commodity Exchange of India, Bhel and Godfrey Philips, it said.

The 75 companies can return a median of 49 percent of their total cash and cash equivalents to their shareholders.

There are nine firms that can distribute over 75 percent of their FY18 on-balance-sheet cash, which are Abbott, Symphony, Lal Pathlabs, Bajaj Consumer Care, Godfrey Phillips, Honeywell Automation, Bata, Pfizer and Hindustan Zinc.

Of the 75 companies, just five companies aggregate over 50 percent of the total incremental distributable cash of Rs 1.1 trillion. These are Hindustan Zinc, ITC, Wipro, TCS, Bajaj Auto.

Public sector undertakings continue to pay consistent dividends on account of regulations requiring them to pay at least 30 percent of their profits as dividends, the report said."

Hillary Clinton has often said, “There is just life to live. It’s yours. Own it, claim it, live it, do the best you can with it.” While it’s simple to understand, very few amongst us follow it.

Family pressure or other commitments prevent us to live a life of our dream and, before we know it, we are either struggling in the rat race or fighting for survival.

This is not true for Gwalior-born Neeraj Gupta (@neerajanalyst), an engineer and MBA from IIT Delhi who quit a well-paying job to try his hand out at something he was passionate about – trading. He wanted to give himself a chance and not look back later in life and regret about not trying.

Having worked in various industries like IT, pharmaceutical and consulting, Gupta has seen it all. But, it was his role in these industries – strategizing and business planning – that is most reflected in his trading style. Neeraj’s trades are simple, but it is his trade management that separates him from other trades. Like a business strategist, he likes to take the maximum out of every trade.

A keen badminton player, Pune-based Gupta likes travelling. He would close down everything and go on a vacation when he needs a break.

In an interview with Moneycontrol, Neeraj Gupta talks about his trades and the effort he took to reach where he currently is.

Q: How did you come to the market?

A: My association with the market has been there since my childhood. My grandfather, as well as my father, has been investing in the market ever since I remember. But, the association was always cursory in those early days.

It was only while I was doing my engineering from NIT Bhopal did I seriously start looking at the market. I used to have discussions on the market with my father and some of my friends from college. Those were early days of internet trading, and, every time I operated my father’s account to buy shares that he asked me to, there was an adrenaline rush and a sense of belonging.

After my engineering, I took up a job in an IT firm and opened a trading account with a broker. I used to dabble in the market with some intraday trades and did some investing. I immediately realised that intra-day was not my cup of tea. In those initial days, my participation was more on account of fundamentals.

Both my father and grandfather were investors and had bought shares like those of Reliance, HDFC Bank and ITC among other blue chips, which we still hold. Hence, my approach to markets in those days was fundamental.

My father has taught me the nuances of investing and how important it is to hold your nerve and not panic when the world around you is falling apart.

I started out in 2007. I was doing well as the markets were good too. But, when it tanked in 2008, it did cause a dent on my portfolio.

Thankfully, those were initial days, and I was still testing waters. So, I was not fully invested. After the first fall, I bought more shares, based on the fundamentals of the companies. Then, the market fell another 20-30 per cent, and I added more. In those days too, thanks to my father’s lessons, I did not average the stock bought earlier, but bought new ones based on my study.

Even today, in my investment portfolio, I do not average on the way down. When the stock turns and is back in an upward trend, I buy the stock again.

The period 2007-10 is what I call my first phase of the market. Since then, my participation in the market was mainly by studying some fundamentals of the company. I used to look at some important ratios of the company and compare it with others in the sector. Then, I picked the best of the lot. But, somehow, I was not comfortable with the approach mainly because I did not trust the numbers that the companies were posting during this period.

This was also the time I was studying for my MBA entrance. I started gathering information on the markets and was introduced to technical analysis. After my MBA from IIT Delhi, I took up a job with an IT company in Bengaluru.

As luck would have it, one of the seniors in the organisation was very good with technical analysis. Being alumni from IIT Delhi, we bonded well. I learned a lot from him. He introduced me to Elliott waves and other indicators. Till then, I was mainly using trendlines and moving averages.

In this second phase of my market exposure which began in 2010, I was more into technical analysis. But, in my college years, there was little trading that I could do.

After 2012, I concentrated more on technical analysis for my trading. I learnt from the Internet by reading blogs and watching videos on technical analysis. I dabbled for a couple of years using technical analysis, but there was no concrete process.

By the end of 2013, I realised that there has to be a system, a well-defined process by which I have to approach the market. I devised a few price action-based systems and back-tested those. A few of them failed even after back-testing, but some succeeded. I started trading these systems and increased my capital gradually as I gathered more experience and confidence in my system.

These systems included derivatives which I had picked up since my MBA. Though I knew the theory behind those, applying it in real life was altogether a different ball game mainly because of the size and leverage that derivative products offer.

I tested the systems I had designed in the derivative market by taking baby steps in the initial days. The purpose was to see if I could earn a steady income before I could take the big step.

From 2014 onwards, I increased my capital and stuck to a disciplined approach to trading. By now, my learning period was over. Though, having said that, the market always teaches you something new every time. My trading style is to take care of all such eventualities.

I wanted to give myself the chance to trade full time. I have given myself a three-year period to try out trading, and there have been no regrets in that decision. I have done well in the market despite markets going down in most part of the previous year.

Q: How do you trade in the market? Can you walk us through a trade?

I only trade in largecap stocks with a 1-3 months holding period. I apply derivative strategies mainly to give cushion to the underlying trade. If my analysis is wrong, the derivative strategies will cushion my losses. If it is right, the leverage helps improve my returns.

Let’s take a recent example of a trade that I took in December 2018 – ITC.

Since I mainly prefer trading on the long side, I look out for important support levels which the stock will respect and move higher. In the case of ITC, 270-275 levels was an important support area.

When the stock entered this area, I took my first entry by shorting the 275 put. ITC hovered in the 275-280 range till February 2019. It reached 273-274 levels and bounced back immediately. For me, this was a good signal that the stock will move higher as there is good buying support at lower levels.

I converted my written (sold) 275 put option to a future position in the stock. Since time lapsed, the put option lost value.

After taking the futures position around the 280 levels, I sold the 285 call option creating a covered call position.

Now, in ITC, the 281 level is a small resistance area, and the next support level in the stock is at 265-268. So, I have to be careful here as the stock is close to the resistance. If it falls, it can travel quite a distance.

I shift to the hourly chart to look for a breakdown. If at all it happens, I shift my 285 call to the 275 strike price level. But, if the price continues to go higher by crossing 282 price point, I will cover my 285 call option at a small loss and sell the 295 call option.

Last week (this interview was taken on March 19, 2019), the stock was moving in the range of 290-295, and I continued holding the position—295 call. My next resistance is around 300 levels. But, today (March 19th), I shifted my option position to April 2019 expiry.

This brought me extra premium. So, if the stock goes back to 280 levels, I need not move the option as the premium in April is high. This premium now acts as a cushion for downside volatility.

If the stock goes down to 265-268 levels, I will again sell the 275 call option. But, if the 265-268 support zone is broken, I will book my losses and come out.

Since I am eating a lot of premium in the entire process, my losses are cushioned. If everything goes right as per my calculation, I will be taking a 25-point profit. But, in the worst case scenario, I am stopped out, and I will be losing 7 points.

(The following portion of the interview was taken on April 5th, 2019)

ITC respected the 300 resistance and fell back to 292-293 levels confirming that it may stay here for some time. I decided to exit my trade the next time the stock would try to retest the top of 300. I managed to get an exit at 297.

This trade in a span of three months gave me 26 points out of which around 16 points came from my future position, and 10 points were contributed by options selling.

The other reason I exited from the trade was that another trade opportunity with a better risk-reward ratio presented itself in the form of India Cements.

So, essentially, I test the waters by selling a put option while initialising a trade. If the pulse is right, and the stock is showing signs of strength, I will square off the option position and move it to futures. However, I will manage the trade trying to extract as much as I can and cushion my losses.

Q: Do you trade any other strategies?

A: I also trade the Nifty which is basically using the Elliott waves. I have studied the characteristics of some indicators like the RSI (Relative Strength Index), the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) and the ADX (average directional index) on different stages of the Elliott wave count.

In an up move, there are five waves in direction of the trend and three waves that are counter direction and are called correction waves. In short, a cycle will have eight waves though there may be many smaller waves within these.

One of the things that I have observed is that, in the third wave, the most important wave the RSI will give is a divergence signal. But, this is the time the divergence will not work. Most people are trapped taking a counter-directional trade on the RSI divergence in the third wave. Likewise, for each wave, I have studied the behaviour of various indicators.

This helps me in two ways. One is, even if my Elliott wave count is wrong, I can look at the indicator to get a feel of where the market is. Secondly, in a wave, I will know which indicator is expected to peak at what levels, and I am ready for the indicators to tilt their hand before taking a trade.

While trading Nifty I take both the long and short position in the market. Many a time Nifty acts as a hedge for my other positions in the market.

Q: How many trades do you keep open at any point of time, and what is your track record?

A: I normally have 7-8 open positions at any point in time. I initiate a trade if it offers me a 1:2.5 risk reward ratio. I used to look for a 1:3 trade but those were few and far between.

While theoretically, the trade starts with a 1:2.5 risk reward trade, the options that I use in my trade eventually improves the performance. In the case of ITC trade, I was looking at a gain of over 25 points for a risk of 7 points – thus giving a risk-reward of 1:3.5.

I hear people talking about the risk of using derivatives in trading. But, if you know how to use it, it can give you very good returns and can be your edge in trading.

Q: Apart from trading these strategies, you also have an investment portfolio. How did you build this portfolio?

A: My investment portfolio is generally theme-based and is a top-down approach to stock picking. I look for sectors that are expected to do well for the next 3-5 years.

Though I call it an investment portfolio, the stock picks are not strictly picked up using a fundamental analysis. However, I look at them before buying.

I use technical analysis inputs to pick up stocks like breakouts after a 12-15 months consolidation. I look for sectors that are breaking out.

Like currently real estate looks good as a theme, but none of the stocks in the sector is breaking out. However, Can Fin Homes and Godrej Properties are the strongest. I will wait for them to breakout and then enter. Presently, PSU banks are breaking out after a long time.

Just like I use themes to pick up stocks, I also use it to avoid stocks. Like in the automobile sector, the electric vehicle will cause a lot of disruptions in the space creating uncertainty. I would avoid this space. The second thing I look to avoid is the poor quality of promoters.

Presently, 60 per cent of my portfolio is in trading, and 40 per cent is in investing. I started off with 80 per cent trading and 20 per cent investing. But, as I gained confidence I added more to investing.

In investing, I do not use a stop loss. But, as mentioned earlier, I will average my position after it goes down only when it resumes its uptrend.

My returns have been a CAGR of 26 per cent for the last five years, and I have a win-loss ratio of 60-40. Two of my winning trades take care of the four losing trades that I incur for every 10 trades taken. But, the four profitable ones give me a good return."

In a separate but similar case, an administrative judge earlier recommended an import ban on some iPhones, siding with Qualcomm. But, unlike the second ruling, that finding is not binding and must be reviewed by the agency.

Both cases involve certain iPhone models containing chips made by Intel Corp.

Qualcomm and Apple did not immediately comment on the second ruling.

The two American companies are locked in a wide-ranging legal dispute in which Apple has accused Qualcomm of unfair patent licensing practices. Qualcomm has in turn accused Apple of patent infringement.

In the case in which Qualcomm lost in the final ruling, Qualcomm had argued that a ban was necessary because Apple infringed one of its patents.

But the ITC said the patent claim should not have been granted in the first place, sidestepping the questions of whether Apple infringed and whether a ban was fair.

The International Trade Commission is a government agency empowered to hear disputes over patented technology.

While the ITC cannot award money damages like federal courts, it can block sales of imported products if it determines they infringe on U.S. patents. So an ITC import ban has the effect of halting U.S. sales of a product made overseas."

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

ITC has undertaken price hike of 6-15% in some of its lower-end cigarette brands (contributing ~20% to cigarette sales volume). The average price hike (with no price increase in key brands) stood at 2%. The recent price hike will have initial reaction on sales, with sales volume expected to moderate in these brands for a short span. However, we believe this price increase will get absorbed in the market as the same was taken after a long gap in the domestic market. We have tweaked our earnings estimates for FY2020E/FY2021E by 1% each to factor in little lower-than-earlier expected volume growth. Discounted valuations of 25x its FY2021E earnings make it one of the important picks in the FMCG space.

Outlook

We retain our Buy with an unchanged price target of Rs. 347.

Highlights:

- Volume growth in the FMCG sector is in contrast to a slowdown in discretionary demand

- Even in FMCG, competitive intensity is visible at low-priced segments

- Superior growth is attributable to reach and the fading threat of Patanjali

-------------------------------------------------

In recent months, there has been a noticeable slowdown in discretionary consumption. Automobile sales growth across categories has been lacklustre since Diwali. A macroeconomic slowdown, rural distress, sluggish rural wage growth and abysmal farm income have been blamed as the main culprits. Additionally, a change in the business dynamics of the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) led to a moderation in credit availability for consumer purchases. But when we look at the other end of the consumption spectrum of staples, the steady volume growth appears intriguing.

Source: Ace Equity, Moneycontrol Research

FMCG volume growth relatively steady

A look at Q3 FY19 results for major FMCG companies show that volume growth has been steady for most companies. The sector appears to have successfully tackled the challenges of GST implementation (Q1 FY18) and demonetisation (Q3 FY17). One reason why FMCG goods may be doing better compared to discretionary goods is that their sales are not dependent on easy availability of institutional credit.

Additionally, some of the discrepancy between demand growth numbers for four-wheelers and consumer goods such as soaps could be more fundamental — relative demand stickiness for the latter. Demand for FMCG goods, particularly staples such as food grains, is relatively inelastic.

Source: Moneycontrol research

Competitive intensity in low-priced segments

However, look beyond robust headline volume growth and one finds weak consumer sentiments are making an appearance. Customers are trading down to cheaper products. There is growing competition in the market for low-priced variants. For instance, though Marico posted decent volume growth of nine percent (Q3 FY19) in coconut oil for its flagship brand (Parachute), sales of low-margin brands (Nihar Naturals and Oil of Malabar) were affected due to higher competitive intensity from companies such as Dabur. In oral care Dabur’s low priced Babool continues to face high competitive intensity, and Colgate’s profit margin on smaller or low-priced packs came under pressure.

Moderation in management commentary

While the growth numbers of FMCG companies were good, the bullishness in management commentary on outlook for growth has begun to moderate. In the September quarter, Bajaj Consumer Care highlighted a slack in wholesale pick up and Dabur underlined rural growth moderation. In the December quarter, Dabur mentioned that relative rural demand growth (versus urban), adjusting for modern trade, is about two percent which is lower than historical average of 3-4 percent. Further, Emami estimated just a tad higher relative growth in rural areas and Britannia noted demand moderation in recent months.

Improved distribution reach and easing of competition from unlisted companies are tailwinds

Still, the aggregate sales growth of the FMCG sector in recent times is impressive. This is better understood if take a longer time period. During CY13-16, there was a noticeable deceleration in the sales growth of listed FMCG companies – a key reason was heightened competitive intensity from new companies that included Patanjali Ayurved.

Read: FMCG lurches between lofty valuation, low growth and Baba Ramdev

Demonetisation and implementation of the Goods & Services Tax affected topline growth, as it adversely affected both supply and demand side temporarily. Subsequently, companies which were better placed in terms of product positioning, distribution reach and cost savings utilised the opportunity to regain lost ground.

Improving response time in Supply chain - HUL

Source: HUL

In the last couple of years, HUL has invested on developing its naturals category (Lever Ayush). It streamlined its supply chain, helping it improve reach and response. For instance, in Q3, the company’s winter portfolio displayed better execution than peers despite a delayed and harsh season. Dabur recouped market share in health supplements and displayed stellar performance in higher priced units of its oral care brands.



Source: Moneycontrol Research, Ace EquityNote: Takes account of top 8 FMCG companies, excluding ITC

Listed companies, in particular, were helped as the aggressive marketing push by Patanjali abated in the past two years. However, higher competitive intensity from unlisted companies continues in few other categories such as beverages (tea, juices) and household insecticides.

Key criteria: Investment behind brands and reach

We expect mid to high single-digit domestic volume growth to sustain for the FMCG sector as companies consolidate their direct distribution reach and grow their share of modern trade and e-commerce channels.

The government’s policy measures that are focused on rural areas should aid consumption growth. We continue to prefer companies that focus on distribution reach and deploy internal accruals to invest behind their brands. A sustainable way of doing the latter is deploying internal accruals such as cost savings and utilising super normal profit from other product groups. For instance, ITC and Marico deploy such cash profits from cigarettes and Parachute Oil, respectively, to expand revenue in other product categories. Considering all these factors, we prefer HUL, Dabur, ITC and Marico at current levels.Follow @anubhavsays

The GST Council had on Sunday decided to cut goods and services tax (GST) rate on affordable homes to 1 per cent without input tax credit (ITC) from earlier 8 per cent with ITC.

The GST on under-construction flats, which is not under the affordable housing segment, has been reduced to 5 per cent without ITC from earlier 12 per cent with ITC.

""The reduction in GST is credit positive for India's property developers...because the reduction in tax will boost demand and increase sales of properties under construction,"" Moody's Investors Service said in a statement.

""India's real estate sector has weathered difficulties in the last few years amid price reductions from a glut of inventory and lackluster demand. The reduction in GST will improve housing affordability as the amount to be paid by a potential house buyer will be reduced, which will increase demand for property,"" it added.

The reduction in GST rate on affordable housing is in line with the government's increased focus on this segment, Moody's said.

""The new GST measures eliminate the ability to claim input tax credit, which may hit the profitability of the developers,"" the rating agency said.

Currently, the developers are able to reduce the tax liability when it makes a sale by claiming tax paid on goods and services required for the construction of properties. ""This will further impact developers' profit margins that are already under pressure.""

Moody's said that the developers have the option to mitigate this loss by increasing prices slightly given that overall pricing for the customer has reduced with lower GST.

Meanwhile, Fitch Ratings said the move to reduce the GST on under-construction properties and expand the scope of the affordable-housing category would improve affordability and support demand.

""We believe this will boost consumer sentiment and cut transaction costs, which can be as high as 18 per cent in Mumbai after including other taxes, such as stamp duty, surcharge and registration fees,"" it said.

""The measure also withdraws input-tax credits for developers, but we still expect marginal savings on overall transaction costs and more so for affordable housing as well as improved buyer confidence, as the measure eliminates ambiguity as to whether property developers are adequately passing on input-tax credit to buyers,"" Fitch said."

ITC shares rallied 3 percent and Engineers India gained 4 percent on Wednesday morning ahead of additional offering of Bharat-22 ETF.

To meet the divestment target, the government will launch an additional offering of Bharat-22 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) on February 14 to raise at least Rs 3,500 crore, officials told PTI on Tuesday.

The ETF sale would be for a single day, in which both institutional and retail investors can participate.

The base issue size has been fixed at Rs 3,500 crore with an option to retain any additional subscription. In this additional offering, the government is selling stake in 20 companies out of 22 available in the Bharat-22 ETF basket.

ITC is not a part of this additional offering, said a notice issued by ICICI Prudential AMC, the trustee for this Bharat-22 ETF. The company's weightage in the ETF basket is 16.45%.

Along with ITC, Engineers India could be the other company wherein the government is not selling stake through ETF, CNBC-TV18 reported quoting sources.

""Government of India (Gol) shall disinvest the shares of central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) and public sector banks (PSBs) forming part of S&P BSE Bharat 22 Index (the underlying index) through this Additional Offering to the extent the shareholding of the GoI post disinvestment is maintained at or above 52 percent of the paid-up share capital of those CPSEs and PSBs, and/or subject to any other limits/conditions specified by the GoI,"" said the notice issued by ICICI Prudential AMC.

""And the government will not disinvest shares of ITC which forms part of the underlying index through this Additional Offering,"" it added.

The cumulative weightage of 20 companies (out of 22) to be disinvested by the government is 78 percent while the weightage of rest of 2 companies, shares of which will be bought from the open market, is 22 percent.

As the government will maintain at or above 52 percent of the paid-up share capital of those CPSEs and PSBs after this Additional Offering, the AMC has to maintain weightage of each stock in Bharat-22 ETF index. So to maintain that weightage, it will have to buy shares of both companies from open market and give it to investors.

So the buying demand could be one of reasons for upside seen in stocks on February 13, a day ahead of opening of Additional Offering of Bharat-22 ETF, sources said.

Earlier, the government had announced 5 percent discount on the closing price of S&P BSE Bharat 22 Index on February 13. Now as there are only 20 companies on offer, the effective discount to the investor would be approximately 3.9 percent.

""The above is only for illustrative purposes and the actual discount applied may vary depending on various factors,"" the trustee notice said.

Engineers India has a 0.78 percent weight in Bharat 22, sources told CNBC-TV18.

Currently the government holds 52.05 percent in Engineers India, and 7.97 percent stake in ITC through Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India.

The government has so far raised Rs 22,900 crore through the Bharat-22 ETF. While Rs 14,500 crore was raised in November 2017, another Rs 8,400 crore was raised in June 2018.

The central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) that are part of the ETF include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

Other constituents include Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks — SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda — figure in the Bharat-22 index.

Also, the government's strategic holding in Axis Bank, ITC and L&T, held through Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), has been put in the ETF basket.

This would be the second ETF offering by the government in the current fiscal which ends in March. In November last year, the government had raised Rs 17,300 crore through a follow-on offer of another exchange traded fund — CPSE ETF, which comprises shares of 11 public sector enterprises. This was the biggest-ever fund raising from an ETF domestically.

ITC was quoting at Rs 280.85, up Rs 5.40, or 1.96 percent and Engineers India was up 1.81 percent at Rs 115.60 on the BSE, at 10:16 hours IST."

One of the key highlights of the third quarter has been the double-digit volume growth reported by FMCG majors. Volume growth of top listed companies hit a multi-year high of 12 percent year-on-year (YoY) in the quarter.

In the consumption sector, net sales and profits grew an average 10 percent each. Volume growth surprised positively as the impact of the increase in the distribution channel and shift from unorganised to organised has been felt in the quarter. The rural segment continued to grow at a better pace than the urban segment.

After GST implementation, the disruption in the supply chain of the sector is sorted. The enhanced outreach is showing in consumption growth across urban and rural areas and across the business segments of consumption and health care for HUL, ITC and Marico.

The rural segment contributes 30 percent for Marico, 40 percent for HUL and nearly 26 percent for ITC. The key to faster growth in the rural segment has been enhanced farm income from government support in MSP and loan waivers and rural welfare schemes in health and household energy leaving more disposable income in hands of the rural populace.

Rural wage inflation has started rising. Supported by an increase in the MSP and good monsoon and subsequently the volume growth. The urban segment with a vast distribution network and new consumer preferences relies both on margins and volumes.

Marico net revenues grew 15 percent with volume growth of 6 percent. The company benefited from softening copra prices (- 23 percent YoY, -12 percent QoQ) but wasn’t able to expand GM owing to volatile prices of other commodities. EBITDA/APAT grew by 16/12 percent.

ITC revenue grew 15 percent and net profit by 13.9 percent. For HUL sales grew 13 percent and net profit at 9 percent. Robust net profit growth for all three led by sales growth point to a new level of rise in margins despite volume led growth.

In business segments, challenges are faced by ITC in cigarettes, and by Marico and HUL in their consumer segments because of already tough competition from unlisted companies like Patanjali and Sri Sri Tattva.

To stay ahead of the competition, these three have attempted additional product portfolio in healthcare and hospitality. HUL expects to benefit from GSK acquisition, Marico has added True roots hair tonic and ITC has added ITC hotels at Kolkata and Goa and Welcome group Hotels."

Anand Rathi

ITC has reported a growth of 14.9% in its standalone in Q3FY18. Revenue growth was driven by broad based growth across all the segments. Cigarettes business registered a volume growth of ~8% after factoring in the price hike taken in this segment.

On profitability front, the company’s operating margins have declined. The drop in the margins of cigarettes business was mainly on account of escalation in input costs due to consumption of higher cost leaf tobacco crop and increased salience of capsule cigarettes in the sales mix.

The FMCG-others segment posted a steady performance during the quarter with revenue growing by 11.5% led by Atta, Snacks, Premium cream Biscuits and Noodles in the Branded Packaged Foods Business, Fragrancing Products and Liquids (handwash & bodywash) in the Personal Care Products Business and Classmate Notebooksin the Education & Stationery Products Business.

Overall, the company has shown growth across all the segments. With strong operating cash flows, continuous capacity expansions across businesses and a healthy balance sheet, we have a positive view on the company over medium to longer term perspective.

We maintain our buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 352 per share.

Highlights:

- Direct income incentives – Marginal boost @Rs 6,000/-

- Fisheries and husbandry – Not enough this time after a strong jump last year

- A steady focus on food processing industries- HUL, Dabur, ITC among companies to benefit from an incremental fix for rural

Finance Minister Piyush Goyal provided a combo of direct income support and allocation across agri and allied industries in Budget 2019. While direct income benefits are supportive for margin of staple consumption, steady push for the food processing industries is positive.

Direct income incentives – marginal uptick but across the region

A set of policy initiatives was targeted toward lower to the middle-income class population.

The urban lower middle class got a complete tax rebate for taxable income up to Rs 5 lakh which leads to Rs 18,500 crore stimulus for three crore middle-class taxpayers.

Measures were focused to target alleviation of rural distress. Assured income support for marginal farmers (Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) amounting to direct income support of Rs 6,000 per year (Rs 75,000 crore scheme) is one such step. This targets 12 crore small and marginal farmer families with land under two hectares.

While the math seems simple with Rs 6,000/- per head annual transfer, it is supportive for staple consumption but doesn’t amount to a quantum leap.

Non-farm productivity – not much to move the needle

There have been a few allocation changes for the agriculture allied sector. Budget allocation for aquaculture is higher than revised budget estimates of FY18 but lower than the FY18 budget proposal. Not surprisingly, fisheries stocks (Avanti feeds, Waterbase, Apex frozen foods) after having a positive move during budget speech slumped thereafter.

Dairy companies such as Parag Milk Foods, Prabhat Dairy, Hatsun Agro had a mixed reaction. Though five-year CAGR growth in allocation suggests continuing emphasis, the current allocation which is marginally lower than FY18 estimates is disappointing. There is special support of Rs 100 crore for state cooperative dairy federations but a closer look indicates this is diverted from the National Daily Plan subhead.

One-time separate enhancement of Rs 750 crore (from Rs 301 crore) allocation for Rashtriya Gokul Mission in the current year itself intended to upscale sustainable genetic up-gradation of cow resources. This could be positive towards for dairy companies focusing on owning dairy farms and focus on premium milk.

In the last Budget, the government announced the facility of extension of the Kisan Credit Card scheme (KCC) to Animal Husbandry and Fisheries farmers. This facility has been extended to fisheries and animal husbandry farmers in terms of Interest rate subvention of up to 5 percent. This seems to be a relief for the farmers involved in such activities, who were discouraged from these activities due to the debt burden.

A steady focus on food processing industries

Last year, budget allocation for the food and distribution department had a 75 percent increase in compared to FY18 actuals. Revised estimates are in fact higher than that of budget estimates which means intended expenditure has been on track. This year, this is a step higher by 7 percent YoY to Rs 190,821 crore with a focus to set up cold storage chains. Further, budget allocation for food processing has been increased by 26 percent from the revised estimates.

Companies gaining attention in this space are HUL, ITC, Prataap Snacks, Venkys ltd, Jain Irrigation etc. One of the key FMCG company to look at in this space is ITC, which is among the better-positioned company in the food processing value chain.

Another additional focus which will boost the prospects for rural infrastructure is the focus on digital villages. Government targets 100,000 digital villages that would be connected through Wi-Fi. It will assist residents in entrepreneurship opportunities such as setting up cottage industries.

Companies like Dabur, Emami, HUL, Jyothy labs have 40-50 percent sales from the rural economy and so can benefit from the rural infrastructure focus and improvement in disposable income. Among this, we remain constructive on Dabur and HUL. Across the board, there has been a positive commentary from the FMCG companies in the current quarterly result implying steady staple demand from the rural sector in spite of otherwise rural distress. In the case of HUL, for instance, growth continues to be led by demand in rural areas which is 1.3 times of urban.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC reported a steady quarter with broad-based growth across segments. Cigarette volumes grew a healthy 7.5% with 8.8% EBIT growth as stable prices propelled steady increase in consumer demand. FMCG business reported 41.6% higher EBIDTA led by strong traction in processed foods and lower losses in personal care despite one off losses on business restructuring in Lifestyle retailing. Paperboard business is in fine fettle given gains from steady prices and benign input costs. Hotels suffered a bit due to lack of marriage season in 3Q and higher depreciation on new properties even as ARR increased by 4-5%. We expect non cigarette business to accelerate on expected margin expansion in FMCG, paper and Hotels business.

Outlook

ITC trades at 22.4xFY21 EPS, 35-40% discount to our coverage universe, which limits downside in the stock. We believe that stable cigarette taxation regime can accelerate volume growth and re-rate the stock. Retain ""Buy"" with SOTP based target price of Rs364.

Dolat Capital's research report on ITC

ITC’s Q3FY19 results were marginally ahead of our estimates. The cigarette business posted 8% volume growth, which was marginally more than our estimate of 7%. The company’s FMCG business reported a strong 11.5% jump. In addition, a 25.7% revenue growth in the Agri businesses was encouraging, as this was the third consecutive quarter of strong growth. Continuous volume increases in cigarette business is a key positive. However, decline in margins in the cigarette business is a cause for concern. Nevertheless, we believe that ITC benefits from a strong leadership in the category and it is likely to increase prices to improve margins, post volume growth stabilization. Going ahead, we believe volume growth will continue to improve, given the delay in duty hike. Considering the constant increase in smuggled cigarettes, the increase in duty is likely to be modest, whenever it happens. Further, ITC’s entry in new FMCG categories, such as dairy, juices and impetus to accelerate growth in existing categories will potentially increase profitability. We have upward revised our FY19E and FY20E EPS estimates to ` 10.1 and ` 11.2, respectively.

Outlook

We introduce FY21E EPS at ` 12.2. In our view, the stock is trading at a steep discount to peers and is an attractive bet. We value the stock at 26x PE, to arrive at a TP of ` 320. Upgrade to BUY.

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

ITC registered mixed performance in Q3FY2019 with revenue, growing by strong 15%, while the decline in OPM (by 124 BPS y-o-y) resulted in operating profit to grow by 11.2%. ITC’s cigarette sales revenue grew by ~10% (driven by ~7% volume growth), but PBIT margin declined by 50 BPS, largely due to unfavourable revenue mix and higher raw material cost. Improving growth prospects of the cigarette business and discounted valuations at ~22x its FY2021E earnings make ITC a better pick in the FMCG space.

Outlook

We maintain our Buy rating with an unchanged PT of Rs. 347.

FMCG major ITC reported 4 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in profit at Rs 3,209 crore for the third quarter ended December 2018. The profit was on expected lines but margin missed estimates.

Revenue from operations in Q3 grew 15 percent YoY to Rs 11,227.66 crore, driven by growth across segments.

Profit was largely driven by other income that increased 30 percent YoY to Rs 836.4 crore in Q3.

Its mainstay cigarette business contributed over 40 percent to total revenue, increased 9.6 percent to Rs 5,074 crore in Q3FY19 with its EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) rising 8.8 percent YoY. EBIT margin though shrunk 50 basis points to 70.1 percent over last year.

Interestingly, the paper business posted a stellar show, growing 20.5 percent YoY to Rs 1,543 crore. Operational earnings, too, were strong as EBIT jumped 23.8 percent YoY to Rs 332 crore and margin improved 50 bps.

“Segment revenue growth of 20.5 percent was driven by strong demand and capacity augmentation in Value Added Paperboard and Decor segments,” ITC said in a statement to the exchange.

Segment results registered a healthy growth driven by product mix enrichment, higher realisation, strategic investments in imported pulp substitution, process innovation leading to improved pulp yield and benefits of a cost-competitive fibre chain.

The company also said operations of the Bleached Chemical Thermo Mechanical Pulp mill were further scaled up during the quarter thereby reducing import dependency and delivering substantial savings to the business, particularly in view of the sharp increase in imported pulp prices during the year.

Capacity utilisation of the recently-commissioned Decor machine at the Tribeni unit was also scaled up during the quarter, the company said in its statement to the exchange.

Further, an extensive rebuild of a paperboard machine at the Bhadrachalam unit was completed during the previous quarter, adding 1.5 lakh TPA value-added paperboard capacity. Capacity utilisation of the machine was further ramped up during the quarter.

Among other business, its hotel business registered 11.7 percent growth on year in the quarter under review with revenue at Rs 452 crore and its EBIT increased 10 percent, however, margin dropped 30 bps to 13.3 percent YoY.

The company said its agri-segment registered a staggering 25.7 percent growth in revenue at Rs 1,925 crore YoY, but EBIT fell sharply by 14.8 percent in the quarter ended December 2018.

Anand Rathi in its first cut report on ITC said, ""Overall the results are in line with the expectations in terms of revenue and slightly below expectations in terms of margin.""

On the profitability front, the company's operating margins declined ~130 basis points to 38.5 percent at Rs 4,326 crore in the third quarter of FY19 as against 39.8 percent at Rs 3,889 crore in Q3 FY18.

In terms of the company's PAT margins, for the latest quarter stood at 28.6 percent at Rs 3,209 crore Q3FY19 as against 31.6 percent at Rs 3,090 crore in Q3FY18.

The decline in the margins was on account of exceptional gain in the corresponding quarter."

Anubhav SahuMoneycontrol Research

ITC’s Q3 FY19 topline is slightly ahead of our expectations (14.9 percent year-on-year), aided by double-digit growth in the non-cigarette business. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin improved sequentially on account of operating leverage seen in the FMCG (other than cigarette) and hotels businesses. Net profit, on like-for-like basis was up 13.8 percent. It’s noteworthy that in the base quarter, the company benefited from Rs 270 crore exceptional item due to a favourable court ruling for Tamil Nadu entry tax.

Revenue growth in the cigarette business benefited from 6-7 percent volume growth on a base of -4 to -5 percent in Q3 FY18. However, moderation in operating profit (-109 bps quarter-on-quarter) weighed on the stock as it implied downtrading.

Result snapshot

Source: Company

The quarter under review underpins improving trend for its other businesses. On a YoY basis, hotels, paperboards and FMCG segments are moving ahead from strength to strength. FMCG sales growth of 11.5 percent is a tad lower than domestic sales growth of Hindustan Unilever (13 percent). Its 76 bps YoY margin improvement at the earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) level draws attention.

The hotels business is seeing a steady improvement in sales, with operating leverage playing out in the seasonal month. Paperboards business also had a healthy sequential improvement in sales, with operating margin slightly lower than the previous quarter (21.5 percent versus 21.8 percent in Q2 FY19)

Segmental performance

Source: Company

Broadly, the result was as per our expectation. Volume trend in cigarettes is as anticipated, though a possible trend for downtrading needs a close watch as the recovery is in a fragile phase. We take solace from the fact that the fiscal/taxation side of the cigarettes business has likely stabilised, if the recent GST Council meets are any indication. We believe that fund requirements for the special situation needs like Kerala rehabilitation effort may not be exclusively levied on sin goods like cigarettes and other tobacco products.

The thesis of broadening of growth levers for ITC is unfolding as expected. Few of ITC’s other businesses have witnessed encouraging growth traction in recent times: volume growth in the FMCG business and growth outlook in the hotel and paper business.

Cigarette-hotel-to-FMCG major ITC has reported a 4 percent on year growth in profit at Rs 3,209 crore, which was on expected lines but margin missed estimates.

Profit was largely driven by other income that increased 30 percent YoY to Rs 836.4 crore in Q3.

Profit in the corresponding quarter of last fiscal stood at Rs 3,090 crore, which included an exceptional gain of Rs 413 crore.

Revenue from operations in Q3 grew by 15 percent year-on-year to Rs 11,227.66 crore, driven by growth across segments.

Cigarette business, which contributed over 40 percent to total revenue, increased 9.6 percent to Rs 5,074 crore in Q3FY19 with its EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) rising 8.8 percent YoY but margin contracted to 70.1 percent against 70.6 percent in same period last year.

Overall, EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) grew by 11.2 percent to Rs 4,325.8 crore YoY, but margin dipped to 38.5 percent against 39.8 percent year-ago that was also below the CNBC-TV18 poll estimates of 40 percent due to higher expenses.

Other FMCG, the second biggest segment under ITC, registered a 10.3 percent on year growth in revenue at Rs 8,274 crore. At operating level, its EBIT grew by 9.6 percent, but margin contracted to 43.9 percent against 44.2 percent YoY.

Other FMCG includes packaged foods, apparel, education and stationary products and personal care products.

Hotels business recorded 11.7 percent growth year-on-year in the third quarter revenue at Rs 452 crore and its EBIT increased 10 percent but margin dropped 30 bps to 13.3 percent YoY.

ITC said its agri segment registered a whopping 25.7 percent growth in revenue at Rs 1,925 crore YoY, but EBIT fell sharply by 14.8 percent in the quarter ended December 2018.

Paper business also showed an excellent performance during the quarter, growing 20.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,543 crore. Its operational earnings, too, were strong in Q3 as EBIT jumped 23.8 percent YoY to Rs 332 crore and margin improved by 50 bps.

Cigarette-to-hospitality major ITC is likely to report strong earnings growth for the quarter-ended December 2018, driven by higher realisation in cigarette and performance improvement in other FMCG and hotels businesses.

The stock rallied 7 percent in 2018 but fell 5 percent during the third quarter. The overall gain was a consequence of no change in tax on cigarettes in last several GST Council meetings.

The company is scheduled to declare its Q3 earnings report on January 23.

According to brokerages, profit is expected to show an average 12 percent growth year-on-year.

ICICI Securities, which expects highest profit growth among brokerages considered for this copy, said with improving margins in the FMCG business and higher realisations in the cigarette business, net profit (adjusted for one-offs in the base quarter) is likely to grow 13.8 percent YoY.

Prabhudas Lilladher estimates 11.2 percent YoY increase in PAT on cigarette volumes and improved profitability in FMCG and hotels.

Largely, brokerages expect revenue growth in the range of 9-12 percent for the quarter ended December 2018. Only Sharekhan estimates more than 15 percent growth in topline, driven by growth across segments barring paper business.

""ITC is expected to post 11.4 percent YoY sales growth during the quarter on the back of robust growth from the cigarettes & FMCG segments,"" ICICI Securities said while Motilal Oswal expects net sales to grow 9 percent YoY.

Cigarette, the key business which contributes more than 40 percent to total revenue, is expected to deliver 4-6 percent growth in volumes on a low base of 5 percent drop during Q3FY18, according to brokerages.

Antique Stock Broking and Edelweiss Securities expect 6 percent volume growth in cigarette business whereas Motilal Oswal and ICICI Securities estimate at 5 percent each. Prabhudas Lilladher and Reliance Securities see 5 percent growth.

Prabhudas Lilladher said cigarette margins are expected to improve marginally on the benefit of price increase taken in Q2 in RST filters whereas Edelweiss Securities said no change in GST rates also leads to no pricing imbalances in the system.

Among others, FMCG, hotels and agri-businesses are expected to show double-digit growth but paper segment growth is likely to remain subdued.

Antique Stock Broking expects continued double-digit growth in other FMCG (non-cigarettes), led by series of dairy product launch, but it will weigh on margin due to high advertising & promotion.

""In FMCG business, we expect around 11 percent revenue growth on a base of 11.8 percent (Q2FY19 saw revenue growth of 12.7 percent on a base of 5 percent),"" said Edelweiss Securities that expects hotels business to clock revenue growth of around 10 percent on a base of 9.2 percent and agri-business to clock growth of around 10 percent YoY on a base of negative 8.4 percent growth.

Paper business is expected to be subdued and may record 1 percent revenue growth on a base of -4.2 percent, according to Edelweiss.

> Demand outlook for FMCG categories and segmental profitability"

Markets consolidated for yet another week but somehow managed to gain over a percent. Weak IIP data and not so encouraging global cues led feeble start, however, it rebounded sharply in the following session, thanks to easing retail inflation and rebound in global indices.

The market has been hovering in a range for nearly three months and we expect this phase to end soon. As quoted in our previous posts, a decisive breakout above 10,950 in Nifty would push the index towards 11,100 and indications are strongly in favour of a breakout this time.

On the downside, the support has now shifted towards 10,780-10,675 zone. We advise participants to continue with a stock-specific trading approach in the meanwhile, and to maintain positions on both sides. Also, keep a close watch on earnings announcements and global markets for cues.

Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 4-6% return in 1 month:

Dabur India: Buy| Target: Rs 445| Stop loss: Rs 414| Return 4.7 %

After a swift rebound from Rs 362 to Rs 458 levels, Dabur has retraced of late and formed a strong base around the support zone of multiple moving averages i.e.( 100/50) day EMA on the daily chart.

We believe that it is a healthy retracement after the strong surge and now it looks all set to resume the uptrend. We advise initiating fresh long positions within Rs 420-425 range. It closed at Rs 428.15 on January 21, 2019.

ITC: Buy | Target: Rs 302| Stop loss: Rs 284| Return 4.1 %

In line with majority FMCG majors, ITC is trading strong. It has retraced marginally of late and reached closer towards its immediate support zone placed around 290 levels. Considering the current market scenario, it’s advisable to prefer defensive stocks for buying.

Traders can initiate fresh longs as per the mentioned zone Rs 287-290. It closed at Rs 289.90 on January 21, 2019.

Siemens: Sell January Futures |Target: Rs 980 | Stop loss: Rs 1080| Return 6.2 %

Siemens has been trading with a corrective bias for almost five months after retesting its record high. It has recently witnessed a rebound but couldn’t surpass the resistance hurdle of long term moving average i.e. 200 EMA on the weekly chart.

After spending nearly a month in consolidation, it has formed a fresh shorting pivot and likely to see a fresh decline. We advise creating fresh shorts in the given range Rs 1045-1055. It closed at Rs 1037.45 on January 21, 2019.

On the daily charts, ITC has been hovering around its 200-days exponential moving average (DEMA) for more than two months in a broader range of Rs 270-290 supported with consistent buying at lower levels.

The consolidation in prices has formed a Symmetrical Triangle pattern on the daily charts and last week also witnessed a fresh breakout above the triangle pattern with marginally higher volumes.

The breakout suggests that follow up buying can move stock toward the north in coming sessions as well. Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs 292-297 for the upside target of Rs 313 levels and a stop loss below Rs 280."

ITC has been in the phase of consolidation for the last three months and has now broken out of a triangle formation on daily chart.

Crossover of major short term exponential moving averages above long term averages are indicating a trend reversal buying in the counter. Prices are tagging above the upper bollinger band and indicating the fresh up move is likely in near term.

Daily RSI which has been trading in rangebound trajectory for the last few weeks, is now moved to a bullish zone. Also, on weekly chart, it is trading above important moving averages and the overall setup making it a prudent buy for short term.

Highlights:

- Kerala allowed a percent calamity tax across goods and services

- Sets a precedence

- Special situation burden not to be exclusively levied on sin goods

- Increase in GST exemption limits positive for FMCG distribution

-------------------------------------------------

Kerala has been allowed to levy a maximum calamity cess of a percent on intra-state sale of goods and service for a maximum period of two years to fund rehabilitation work. This decision of the Goods & Service Tax Council is already backed by the constitution provision (Article 279A), which allows it to raise fiscal resources for a specified period to deal with natural calamities.

Special situation burden not to be exclusively levied on sin goodsEarlier expectations for calamity cess included implementing the calamity cess on goods and services on a pan-India basis and targeting only products like cigarettes. Earlier this week , the GST ministerial panel favoured limiting it to Kerala, levying calamity cess of a percent on goods and services decided by it. The GST Council has now allowed for a maximum calamity cess of a percent on intra-state sale of goods and service for a maximum two year period.

Implication of this development is straight forward and means that special situation burden would not be exclusively levied on sin goods like cigarettes and other tobacco products. This also sets a reference for future as the GST legislation provides for levy of special taxes for a specified period to raise additional resources during any natural calamity or disaster. Hence, on each such occasion tobacco companies may not be on the receiving side.

Stock reactionStocks in this segment like ITC, Golden Tobacco, Godfrey Phillip, VST Industries and NTC industries have positively reacted to the news. Of this, we remain positive on ITC. In our previous note, we had highlighted possibility of higher taxation as a key business risk and this aspect has moderated with the new development. ITC’s cigarette business has stabilised recently after adverse impact of the GST implementation.

Few of ITC’s other businesses have witnessed encouraging growth traction in recent times: volume growth in the FMCG business and growth outlook in the hotel and paper business. The stock (26 times FY20 estimated earnings) is currently trading at a significant discount to the FMCG sector’s trading multiple.

Other changes –positive for FMCG distributionThe GST Council has also made few changes for small and medium enterprises, which includes doubling the exemption limit for the GST registration and relaxation in the composition scheme. This may be good news for various retailers who may want to avoid incremental cost and time for GST compliance.

It is evident from various corporate commentaries post-GST implementation that the wholesale channel has shrunk on account of difficulty with GST compliance. While various companies have already tied up their supply chain infrastructure and increased their direct reach over this period, GST changes can still bring relief to retailers, small traders, grocers from GST compliance issues and hence can have a positive impact on the supply side.

Having said that it is not necessary that every trader would opt for it as then they may not be able to claim benefits of input tax credit.

ITC shares gained 1.88 percent in morning on Friday after global brokerage house CLSA retained buy call on the stock and raised price target to Rs 400 from Rs 390 earlier due to unchanged in tobacco taxes. It implies more than 38 percent potential upside from Thursday's closing levels.

With elections now around the corner, further GST tax changes seem unlikely, according to CLSA.

ITC shares gained 1.5 percent intraday on Monday after global investment firm Macquarie maintained outperform call on the stock with a price target at Rs 376, implying 34 percent potential upside.

Calamity cess of 1 percent limited to Kerala is significantly positive for the company because the street was expecting a Pan-India calamity cess at a higher rate, the research house said.

Thomas Isaac, the state's Finance Minister, after meeting a group of ministers in the national capital said Kerala would be permitted to have 1 percent cess on the value of goods and services across all or select items for two years.

If the additional cess is approved by the GST Council, Kerala would be the first state to levy a calamity cess.

The GST Council will take a decision on the matter in its 32nd meeting scheduled for January 10.

Macquarie said earnings growth recovery would lead to re-rating.

The cigarette-hotel-to-FMCG major had reported a 11.9 percent on year growth in second quarter (July-September) profit to Rs 2,954.67 crore, driven by cigarettes, FMCG and paper segments.

Surprisingly, the market has paused at a major resistance level for the last two trading sessions. Usually, the market reverses sharply after hitting major hurdles, especially when it is in pullback mode.

The Nifty has a strong hurdle of falling (supply) trend line placed at 10,840 and it has also completed nearly 80 percent of the recent fall which started from 10,940 to 10,330.

Such type of combinations resulted in a quick drop. However, the market is not responding to it rather it is holding well above the same, since the last two trading sessions.

Such type of markets become difficult for contra traders to take a contra call of trading short sell when markets are trading at key resistance levels.

Specifically, as per Elliott Wave Theory, next 3 days are crucial for Indian markets. If we manage to cross 10,950 it would send the market to the next biggest hurdle, which is at 11,200-11,300.

Of course, we cannot expect a vertical up move but it would help bulls to take buy calls at each major supports. To support the above statement we need to see, ""how index heavyweight stocks are placed"".

When we went through with index heavyweights, we found that except ITC most of them are forming the higher bottom and higher top series, which is an indication of rising trend is intact for the short term.

However, in several past occasions, we saw that if ITC moves, then it help indices to surpass major barrier. In brief, the stock ITC should be on the watch list.

On the other side, failing to surpass 10950 in next 3 days would be negative for the market. It would keep the market range-bound with a negative bias between 10900 and 10400.

Our view is markets have enough supporting parameters based on price charts, oscillators, PCR and VIX, which are suggesting that bulls are confident and would help the market to reach 10900 levels in next one or two days.

However, it also does not mean that Nifty would cross 10950 levels without any major efforts and till the market is not crossing the same we should avoid taking positional calls at current levels. On the dismissal of 10950, certainly, we should be confident to follow buy on dips strategy.

Assembly election results for three key states — Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan — threw a big surprise for D-Street with BJP losing all three states. However, bigger surprise was the rally seen after the results were out.

Most experts, who Moneycontrol spoke to before the results were announced, were of the view that if BJP closes with 0-3 tally, there would be a high probability that Nifty would head towards 10,100-levels. However, a three-day rally actually put the index above 10,700.

The only setback on December 11 morning for market was resignation of Urijit Patel that was announced an evening before. While he cited personal reasons for the decision, but it comes in the backdrop of the RBI-government differences over several issues. The announcement induces volatility on D-Street for some time.

Though, appointment of Shaktikanta Das as the new governor calmed nerves, and emergence of one single party with a clear majority boosted sentiment eventually pushing Sensex by about 1,000 points in just three trading sessions.

The journey from here on could be a rocky one as domestic and foreign investors will shift their focus to General Elections scheduled for May 2019. The outcome of the 2019 elections will determine the policy direction for next 5 years.

Well, a 0-3 score of BJP is not a positive sign but history suggested that investors vote differently in assembly elections and Lok Sabha elections.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is no direct co-relation between the outcome of these ‘semi-final’ state polls and the Lok Sabha polls (2004, 2009 and 2014 election results point toward the same).

But, what does this tell about the investment strategy? Investors should not put too much focus on the assembly election results and use dips to get into fundamentally strong stocks, and at the same time, reduce their beta play in the portfolio to safeguard from volatility.

“Going forward, the hangover of state election results will recede, we expect the focus to revert to fundamentals, albeit with continued elevated volatility. Overall, macros have eased out for India in the last two months with the correction in crude oil prices,” Motilal Oswal said in a report.

“From an earnings perspective, we expect domestic cyclical driven by financials to drive earnings in 2HFY19, taking over from global cyclical which were driving earnings growth lately,” it said.

The domestic brokerage firm further added that their portfolio construction is biased towards largecaps and also stocks with strong earnings visibility, resilient to macro risks and reasonable valuations. Key stocks are ICICI Bank, HDFC, SBI, Maruti Suzuki, HUL, Titan Company, Infosys, L&T, RBL Bank, TeamLease, IGL, Indian Hotels, M&M Financial Services.

Key risk for markets would be if the domestic equity investors, who started to invest on the back of Modi's win in May 2014, start to reduce new investments, highlights CLSA in a note.

Also, an analysis conducted by the global investment bank highlights competitive populism by the BJP and the Congress, with farm loan waivers, unemployment grants, and farmer handouts. This is good for consumption, but bad for a capex cycle recovery.

Both BJP and Congress had promised farm-loan waivers of up to Rs 2,00,000 per farmer in the states that just went to polls. In addition, Congress had promised pensions and loan subsidies/removal of GST on agricultural equipment to farmers.

“This sets the tone for poll promises ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Implementation of such poll promises would reduce the government’s fund availability for infrastructure even as the private sector is yet to step up infrastructure investments,” added the CLSA note.

The global investment bank added that consumption plays, particularly rural ones, should benefit from such handouts. The related top ideas are M&M, Colgate Palmolive India, Crompton Consumer, ITC, TTK Prestige, Zee Entertainment, Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki.

Policy making will be important to chart the course for markets in 2019, feel experts. As soon as the political noise will go down, chatter about growth and earnings will pick up. One key pain point highlighted in assembly elections was the rural distress. Hence, there could be an enhanced focus on the rural and agricultural economy.

Strategists at Morgan Stanley feel that the political cycle (measured as policy certainty) is likely to turn down, growth is likely move higher, and credit growth seems to be at the beginning of a new cycle. They also believe terms of trade are improving, rates are in a bit of a pause before continuing their rise, and profit margins appear to be at the start of a new up cycle.

Morgan Stanley continues to back growth at a reasonable price and believes the way to construct portfolio is to buy stocks of companies with the highest delta in return on capital.

They expect market performance to broaden and hence also like midcaps where the forward growth is not reflecting share price performance.

Ridham Desai and Sheela Rathi highlighted key themes in Morgan Stanley portfolio, wherein they prefer 8 growth stocks — Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, ITC, Prestige Estates, Asian Paints, Titan Company, M&M Financial and Bajaj Auto.

ITC Ltd Wednesday said its agri-biotech arm Technico Agri Sciences (TASL) has entered into an agreement with the UK's James Hutton Institute to source 16 new varieties and 600 new clones of potato for trial and testing in India.

""These differentiated varieties promise to further benefit India's farmers and the potato processing industry as well as help in promoting potato exports. The agreement is initially for a period of five years and is extendable,"" ITC said in a statement.

These varieties (of potato) will grow through a process of research and development and evaluation to identify varieties suitable for growing in India in different states, the company said.

The company said this agreement will also help address the demand of processors and exporters for new varieties and are expected to further improve yields by 15-20 per cent and enhance farmer incomes by better realisation.

Technico Agri Sciences Limited (a 100 per cent subsidiary of ITC Ltd) is involved in the business of producing and selling 'early generation' high vigour seed potato."
"December 12, 2018 02:16 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/nifty-target-for-2019-end-at-14000-bet-on-top-five-large-cap-stocks-karvy-3280571.html,"We believe that the formation of a business-friendly government would help drive the next rally in equities. Our target for Nifty for December 2019 is 14,000, Rajiv Ranjan Singh, CEO, Karvy Stock Broking said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Now that state election uncertainty is over where do you see markets heading?

Yes, as we have seen steady rollovers into December series, and positive news flow from G20 meet, especially trade war truce between the US and China, helping global markets to move on a stronger note.

With a slew of events such as US Fed meet outcome, RBI meeting lined up during December, indices are likely to be volatile. The Nifty is likely to trade in a broad range of 10,600-11,200 with a positive bias.

Do you think the pain in the mid and smallcaps is here to stay?

The mid and small-cap stocks tend to outperform when they are at a significant discount (at least 20 percent) to large-cap valuations, whereas they are at par now.

In the near to mid-term, we expect largecaps to perform better as mid and small-cap valuations are not yet favourable. Over the coming quarters, largecaps are likely to do better. The mid and smallcaps are likely to underperform until their valuations become attractive.

However, we believe that after mid-2019, with decent time correction, conditions may be favourable for mid and smallcaps to perform well.

After a muted 2018, what are your predictions for the year 2019?

We believe that a broad-based economic recovery is underway, and most importantly, capex spending is recovering. This should support corporate earnings and equity markets.

However, in the coming months, general elections remain an overhang. We believe that the formation of a business-friendly government would help drive the next rally in equities. Our target for Nifty for December 2019 is 14,000.

2019 strategy: Top five fundamental safe stocks which are good buys at current levels for a holding period of 1 year?

Our top 5 picks for one year are — HDFC, ICICI Bank, ITC, L&T, and Maruti.

Which sectors are likely to hog the limelight in the year 2019?

Since we expect growth in the coming quarters to be led by capex spending, we favour cyclical sectors — banks, capital goods, autos and consumption.

Do you think rupee will continue to appreciate in the near term?

In the near term, the rally in INR is likely to reverse and we may see marginal depreciation towards 72. Oil prices are likely to appreciate to around USD 65/bbl in the near term which will be the driver for the currency market.

Any sector(s) which you think could turn out to a dark horse in 2019?

State-owned banks could be a dark horse in 2019 on account of the peak in NPL cycle, recovery in stressed assets via IBC, low valuations. A broad-based economic recovery will be supportive. Pharma could be a dark horse in 2019 as FDA issues fade, as well as cost competitiveness in global markets.

What should be the ideal strategy for investors for the next one year? How much (in terms of percentage) should be allocated towards equities, fixed income, gold etc.

We expect H2 of CY2019 to be good for equities and believe investors should be overweight equities, especially stocks that are geared to an economic recovery.

While the asset allocation depends on a number of factors like age and risk tolerance. On an average one could allocate 70% to equities, 20% to fixed income, 5% to gold and 5% to cash.

Manav Chopra, CMT, Head Research - Equity, Indiabulls Ventures, said the short term trend for the Nifty remains bullish as long as it holds above 10,550-10,500 levels, which also coincides with its November lows. “The recent decline looks corrective in nature and the index is likely to hold its support levels. It could trade in a 10,5000-10,850 range before any bullish trending move.”

Edited excerpts:

Q: The momentum fizzled out in December after the 5 percent gain seen in November. Do you see a bounceback next week when much of the uncertainty is out of the way with respect to the outcome of the state elections? What are the charts suggesting?

A: The Nifty after the previous month's advance witnessed some profit booking last week as the index faced crucial hurdles around the 10,850-10,900 zone. The short term trend remains bullish as long as the index holds above 10,550-10,500 levels, which also coincides with its November lows.

The recent decline looks corrective in nature and the index is likely to hold its support levels. It could trade in a 10,5000-10,850 range before any bullish trending move.

The oscillators have declined from their overbought zone and any fresh bullish crossover will witness momentum once the index exceeds 10,750 levels for higher targets towards 10,950 and 11,200.

Q: Small and midcaps struggled in the first week of December. Do you think the pain is here to stay and investors should look at largecaps?

A: With the state election results around the corner and general elections in 2019, there will be an increase in volatility across the midcap space.

We expect defensive sectors to outperform and are likely to witness a relative outperformance in the near future. Colgate Palmolive, Marico, and Britannia are our top picks from this segment and we expect an upside potential of 10-15 percent.

From the largecap space, Zee Entertainment Entrerprises, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Axis Bank have formed a strong base, which indicates limited downside.

Q: Exit polls and state election results will keep the markets volatile. What should be the investment strategy for investors as we approach the mother of all events – general elections next year?

A: One needs to maintain a stock-specific approach and avoid overleveraging on midcaps. Investors should be bullish on select private banks namely Axis Bank and HDFC Bank. In terms of sectors, FMCG and pharma are likely to be the bellwethers along with IT. We expect the market to consolidate for the next few months and see sector rotation.

Q: What is the Bank Nifty chart suggesting?

A: The Bank Nifty is likely to consolidate its gains around the 26,000-25,900 levels on the downside, which is likely to provide a cushion in case of a decline.

The Bank Nifty has tested its key long term average and needs to close above 26,750 for any bullish breakout. The oscillators remain in the buy mode and indicate support at 50 daily moving average, which is likely to hold. The index will resume its uptrend for targets towards 27,200.

Q) Top three trading strategies for the coming week with an investment horizon of 1 month?

A) Here is a list of top three ideas for a target of next 1 month:

Siemens: Target: Rs 1030-1065

There is the emergence of bullish divergence in MACD and record weekly volume breakout which indicates strong accumulation patterns. Investors can look at buying the stock now for an upside target of Rs 1030-1065

GSFC: Target: Rs 119-125

The price has formed a probable bullish Head & Shoulder pattern and has formed a right shoulder pattern. The structure hints for a higher bottom in making which indicates an attractive entry level. Investors can buy the stock now for an upside target of 119-125

ITC: Target: Rs 315-325

ITC recently took multiple supports at the rising trend line in the past few weeks and has formed a minor higher bottom. It has exceeded the weekly resistance level as well. Investors can look at buying the stock now for an upside target of Rs 315-325

Be it a chocolate, chips or your favourite noodles, you will be able to find it on an e-commerce portal before it hits the supermarket shelves near you.

FMCG companies are looking at exclusive tie-ups for a limited period to launch their products on e-commerce portals first before taking it to the mass markets.

Last week, FMCG major ITC tied up with Bigbasket for selling YiPPee's My range noodles. The products were available on Bigbasket for one week, following which it was distributed to all modern format and general trade stores across India.

“Digital e-commerce is an important opportunity area. The digital world, including e-commerce platforms, are effective tools to strengthen the brand’s visibility and build a consumer franchise, ”Hemant Malik, Divisional Chief Executive-Foods Division of ITC, said, adding that over the last few years the e-commerce segment is growing at over 120 percent for ITC.

Not only ITC, Mondelez too had launched its augmented reality-enabled Amazon Exclusive Cadbury Dairy Milk Silk Gift Box around Valentine’s Day and Diwali. At a recent event, Herjit S Bhalla, Managing Director, Hershey India, said the company is looking for an e-commerce exclusive product from Hershey in the future.

Bigbasket’s Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Hari Menon too sounded optimistic about the possibility of FMCG players like Hindustan Unilever, Dabur, Britannia, Marico and Emami tapping the e-commerce space for a limited period with an exclusive launch of products.

Menon believes e-commerce platforms are the best platforms for launch of products as it helps FMCG companies receive customer feedback and data.

“When we do exclusive tie-ups, our objective is to see what are customers doing and how are they behaving. We capture that data as we are digital and feed them back to the company, which helps them figure out what the initial reaction is for the product,” Menon said.

FMCG experts said it is a go-to-market strategy for these companies to promote their products first on an e-commerce portal to create the buzz about the product and judge customer behaviour.

“The online shopping for food and grocery items is gaining acceptability among Indian consumers. Online players such as Amazon and Flipkart, along with online grocers such as Bigbasket and Grofers, have boosted the consumer confidence for online food and grocery shopping,” an analyst from a brokerage firm said.

In India, rise in internet penetration or better internet connectivity, online banking, mobile wallets, the overall rise in consumer spending and improved infrastructure is leading the way for increased online FMCG sales.

According to market research firm Nielsen, contribution of e-commerce to total FMCG sales is expected to be 11 percent by 2030. e-commerce contributed 0.4 percent to FMCG sales in 2016 and 2018. The same is expected to be around 1.3 percent of the branded packaged FMCG sales."

While the September quarter results of ITC met street expectations, that of fellow FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever marginally beat expectations. Both companies can thank their rural customers for the fillip.

The sales of ITC grew by 15.4 percent and that of HUL by 10 percent during the September 2018 quarter.

For the last few years, the surge in agribusiness and rural sales has been the driving factor of the future growth potential of FMCG businesses in India. Rural contributes 35-40 percent of overall sales value.

Rural segment growth is on the radar of analysts in assessing the roadmap of ITC and HUL in India. HUL operates in three segments of Homecare, beauty care, and foods solutions business. Of this, the home care and beauty care products are widely distributed in rural and semi-rural areas too, given the rising youth lifestyle aspirations of rural India.

“Rural growth continues to grow ahead of its urban counterparts. So, we certainly believe that it has the potential to grow much faster,” said Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman and Managing Director, HUL.

The key verticals of its peer ITC are cigarettes, FMCG, hotels, agri, and paper. ITC through its e-choupals and associated distribution reaches out to rural areas with its agri and FMCG products.

As per brokerage Prabhudas Lilladhar, HUL has reportedly grown its rural business 1.2 times of its urban growth.

This could also be on part of lower current comparison base in rural consumption. The reports suggest that in the past quarter rural growth was 1.5 times urban growth.

The report also suggests that ITC’s agri and FMCG business growing around 13 percent with a recovery in rural consumption.

The ITC management has highlighted a stable demand environment with visible signs of recovery, especially in the rural markets. Analysts expect cigarette volumes to recover driven by a recovery in rural consumption which forms two-thirds of smokers.

For other players in the sector too, the rural market has played an important role. For Dabur in the second quarter of Q2, the rural growth has been higher than urban by 3-4 percent, as per management.

The rural markets were impacted on the downside during demonetisation and GST implementation due to the large informal sector in rural areas. As per Nielsen report issued in August 2018, after GST implementation, supply chain inefficiencies have been ironed out and this will help in rural supplies. Thus, consumption in rural areas will depend largely on current inflation and rural income.

IMPROVING RURAL CONSUMPTION

The government intends to double farm income by 2022 through the increased budget allocation in water and electricity and also raising the Minimum Support Price or MSP to agricultural produce. This bodes well through demand pick up for large FMCGs like HUL and ITC that already have a vast rural distribution network in place.

Nielsen report states that post GST implementation, the price advantage of the informal sector will go down that will help branded FMCGs ITC, HUL and the like to compete on equal footing.

“The rural segment continued to grow faster at 1.2-1.25x for FMCG companies but still remains lower than historical levels,” according to ICICI Direct Research.

Analyst estimates are that future growth of FMCG would be more in rural areas with nearly 3 times of urban growth. However, it remains an overall balanced picture for rural consumption due to its large dependence on monsoon recorded at 92 percent for all Indian basis as per Skymet estimates."

India Inc earnings for the September quarter have managed to just about meet Street expectations so far. Until October 29, most of the 28 Nifty companies that released their Q2FY19 results reported net profit and EBITDA either in-line or just above estimates.

The earnings season has been uneventful so far with headline numbers broadly meeting estimates and a few disappointments. Of the 28 companies, 18/23 have either met or exceeded our estimates on the PAT/EBITDA front, Motilal Oswal said in a note.

The broader narrative around earnings has not changed much with continued earnings downgrades, it said. For the MOSL Universe, sales, EBITDA and PAT grew 25.8%, 13.9% and 6.3% YoY, respectively, as against expectations of 23.6%, 14.1% and 9%, respectively.

Among the Nifty constituents, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank, Ultratech Cement, BPCL, Bharti Airtel, HCL Tech and Reliance Industries have missed our PAT estimates, while ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance and Dr. Reddy’s have exceeded estimates, said MOSL.

The domestic brokerage firm slashed Nifty EPS estimates for FY19 by 2.1 percent to Rs 528 from Rs 539, primarily driven by Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel. For FY20, Nifty EPS has been cut by 1.4 percent to Rs 665 from Rs 674.

“We are building in Nifty EPS growth of 16%/26% for FY19/20,” said the note.

Motilal Oswal highlights 10 sectoral highlights post Q2 results:

Information Technology

The seasonal strength of Q2 manifested across top-tier IT. The revenue performance was patchy across tier-II with Hexaware, Mindtree, and Persistent Systems missing expectations. An overall commentary, on-demand environment remains positive and is substantiated by another quarter of healthy deal wins.

Banks

Private Banks continued reporting steady trends in loan growth, though the margin performance has been mixed – ICICI Bank and RBL Bank reported an improvement, while Kotak Mahindra Bank and IndusInd Bank exhibited a modest decline.

Asset quality has been stable for retail banks, though worries remain on the exposure towards IL&FS Group (sizeable exposure with IndusInd Bank and YES Bank). ICICI Bank has reported surprisingly benign slippages, despite management change.

NBFC

Most NBFCs continue reporting strong numbers on the business front. All vehicle financiers have reported strong growth and stable-to-improving margins. HFCs have reported in-line numbers, but yields for smaller HFCs continue to be under pressure. Management commentary on liquidity has been divergent.

Autos

Results so far have been in line with expectations. Continued raw material cost pressure and currency volatility (MSIL) in 2QFY19 have been managed by price hikes and cost-control initiatives.

Even though OEMs see the impact of raw material inflation easing in 2HFY19 (except steel), the risk on margin remains due to currency volatility and higher discounting because of heightened competitive intensity.

Consumer

Results of consumer companies have been good so far with sector heavyweights HUL and ITC reporting in-line numbers and indicating an improving trend. Nestle reported an impressive set of numbers on all fronts.

While Asian Paints disappointed on margins, its volume growth was robust and ahead of expectations. Colgate’s results were also in line with low expectations. Given that these five stocks contribute nearly 70% of sectoral EBITDA and PAT, the results season on a weighted average basis is likely to be in line with expectations.

Oil & Gas

Only RIL and BPCL have reported numbers so far. Both have reported a sequential contraction in the refining margins. We expect pressure on the refining margin to continue in the third quarter as well.

Petrochemical margins have also contracted sequentially for RIL. We expect margins pressure to continue due to the impact of higher prices on demand, and also the start-up of two new ethane crackers in the US.

Telecom

Bharti witnessed a sluggish quarter, while Vodafone-Idea is also expected to deliver a muted performance. ARPU down trading (mainly in the postpaid category) and the burgeoning debt have been the key concerns.

We believe that (a) the shift of competition among top three players (v/s smaller players earlier) for higher subscriber market share and (b) Jio Phone’s healthy offtake would continue exerting pressure on incumbents’ performance.

Metals

Although steel prices dipped in July due to seasonal volatility in demand, average realization remained stable QoQ for JSW Steel. Margins, too, remained close to historical high as cost inflation was benign.

A similar stable margin trend is expected for Tata Steel and SAIL. Margins for steel companies have clearly peaked on the recent increase in coking coal prices and the INR depreciation.

Capital Goods

Results have been mixed so far, with BHEL’s operating performance coming in much below expectations (adverse revenue mix impacted the company’s margins profile), while Bharat Electronics delivering extremely strong results.

Pharma

Performance in the Pharma space has been mixed. US business continues witnessing pricing pressure (albeit the intensity is now lower). Domestic formulations business grew at a subdued rate due to a high base of the past year. Favorable currency movements led gains to some extent.

Disruption in China on account of pollution concerns is providing a window of opportunity to backward-integrated Indian companies. In particular, DIVI and ALPM have delivered a strong beat on earnings. DRRD and JLS’ results were largely in line. GLXO’s performance was below expectations.

ICICI Direct's research report on ITC

ITC’s cigarette segment posted robust volume growth of ~6% in Q2FY19. Cigarette volumes had grown 1.5% in Q1FY19 after three consecutive quarters of volume de-growth. In addition to strong growth from the cigarette segment, sales growth of 7.3% YoY was supported by FMCG, agri business, paperboard & hotels business growth of 12.7%, 12.8%, 8.8% & 20.8%, respectively Operating profit grew 11.8% to Rs 4,206 crore supported by 8.7% & 13.4% EBIT growth in cigarette & paperboard segments. FMCG EBIT witnessed a significant improvement from Rs 20.5 crore to Rs 58.5 crore on the back of strong growth in the branded packaged foods business, better product mix and cost rationalisation initiatives. Similarly, hotels EBIT increased from Rs 4.2 crore to Rs 15.6 crore on the back of increase in occupancy to 67-68% & strong F&B sales. However, agri segment EBIT declined 7.8%. On the back of higher operating profit, net profit grew 11.9% YoY to Rs 2,954.7 crore.

Outlook

With the government’s impetus to boost rural incomes coupled with normal monsoons this year, we expect to witness a broad based recovery in volume growth. In the current year, we are expected to witness 4% volume growth in cigarettes after five years of decline and 13.9% sales CAGR in FMCG on the back of focus on premiumisation across brands. We expect revenue and earnings to grow at a CAGR of 10% and 11.6%, respectively. We value the stock on an SOTP basis valuing the cigarette business at 30x PE and FMCG business at 5x price/sales. We continue to maintain our BUY rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 365.

Dolat Capital's research report on ITC

ITC’s Q2FY19 results came marginally ahead of our expectations. The cigarette business posted ~6% volume growth which was marginally better than estimate of 5%. The company reported strong 12.7% jump in FMCG business. Further, a 12.8% revenue growth in Agri businesses was encouraging as the business reported growth in the second consecutive quarter after lackluster performance in prior four quarters. Volume growth in cigarette business is continuously improving, which is a key positive. Going ahead, we believe that the volume growth would continue to improve with the delay in duty hike. Considering the constant increase in smuggled cigarette contribution we believe that the increase in duties would remain modest whenever it happens. Further, ITC’s entry in new FMCG categories and impetus to accelerate growth in existing categories would increase profitability.

Outlook

Maintain PER of 29x FY20E EPS and TP of ` 320. Maintain Accumulate.

Diversified conglomerate ITC Limited has decided to enhance its dairy portfolio by entering the paneer and milkshakes segments within two months, a company official said Tuesday.

ITC had earlier forayed into the dairy segment with the launch of milk and ghee in select markets.

The company on Tuesday launched milk and curd for the Kolkata market.

""We are going to launch paneer for the Kolkata market and milkshakes pan India within two months,"" Hemant Malik, divisional chief executive (foods) of ITC said.

He said while milk, ghee, paneer and curd would be sold under the 'Aashirvaad' brand, there will be a different brand for milk shakes.

ITC initiated the foods division in 2002, and started the dairy business at Munger in Bihar.

""We have been selling milk in markets of Munger, Patna and Bhagalpur in Bihar. Now, we have come to Kolkata"", he said.

The company had been selling ghee in Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Delhi, he added.

Malik said initially milk would be procured from Bihar and subsequently from a local manufacturer in West Bengal for which a tie-up is already in place.

""We want to source it (milk) locally. But the challenge is quality,"" he said.

Talking about the revenue generated from ITC's foods business, he said it was below Rs 9,000 crore although consumer spend was in excess of Rs 12,000 crore. The difference was due to seller discounts offered by the company.

ITC’s quarterly result marks another quarter of improvement, which is becoming broad-based. While the cigarettes business is stabilizing, we are also encouraged by the improvement in various other growth levers such as hotels, paperboards and FMCG.

Having said that, we continue to highlight that volume recovery in the cigarettes business is still fragile. Hence, investors should keep a close watch at the possibility of higher taxation, which can lead to higher price difference between legal cigarettes and other tobacco smoking sources.

Segmental business: FMCG & Hotels positive

Source: Company

ITC’s topline Q2 results were broadly inline with our expectations. Net revenue grew by 7.3 percent YoY, mainly aided by volume growth in FMCG sector, stabilization in cigarette segment and better business dynamics in paper and hotels segments.

EBITDA margin improved by 150 bps YoY on account of positive operating leverage and improved fundamentals for the non-cigarette businesses.

Cigarette business stabilizing: Quarter under review suggest that ITC’s cigarette business is improving (+10 percent YoY) with an implied volume growth of 5-6 percent compared to ~6 percent decline in Q2 FY18.

Slight dip in profitability was on account of stocks damaged due to floods in Kerala and costs relating to changeover to the new graphic health warnings on cigarette packs.

FMCG (Others): Underling growth in company’s FMCG business is about 13 percent on YoY basis similar as last few quarters driven by branded packaged foods, personal care products (personal wash, fragrance products) and Class mate notebooks partially offset by ongoing restructuring of retail footprint and sluggish growth in the Lifestyle retailing business. Overall trade conditions are improving on the back of demand recovery in rural areas.

Operating margin, though still mediocre, have improved significantly on YoY basis on the back of cost efficiencies, product mix, operating leverage despite gestation period in new categories like Juices, Dairy, Chocolates, and Health & Hygiene segment in the Personal Care Products Business.

Last quarter, couple of brands got attention. Within dairy category, Aashirvaad Svasti milk was rolled out in the city of Patna. Secondly, the recently acquired 'Nimyle' range of herbal floor cleaners was introduced to new markets.

The company also updated that during the quarter a new manufacturing facility was commissioned at Trichy, Tamil Nadu. Over all about fifteen FMCG related projects are underway and in various stages of development.

Paper: One of the most noticeable results was from the counter of paperboard business. Sales improvement was aided by capacity enhancement in value added and decor segments. A rebuild Bhadrachalam unit led to addition of 1.5 lakh tonne value paperboard capacity.

Operating margin (+90bps YoY) improvement was driven by better product mix, process innovation and higher realizations. Strategic investments in imported pulp substitution and process innovation helped in improved pulp yield.

Hotels segment witnessed robust topline and operating margin gain on account of improved industry cycle leading to better room rates, operating leverage and growth in F&B (food and beverages). Company added two properties to its portfolio - ITC Kohenur (Hyderabad) and ITC Grand Goa (Goa).

Agri-business segment profit continued to remain under pressure on account of continued pressure on legal cigarette industry volumes. The company, however, has inched up in the food processing industry with the launch of packaged prawns, super safe spices, fresh fruits and vegetables and dehydrated onions under the ITC MasterChef and Farmland brands. During the quarter under review, the company forayed into the Frozen snacks category in the retail segment under the ITC Master Chef brand.

Regulatory risk needs to be closely watched

Recently, a few of ITC’s businesses have witnessed encouraging growth traction –volume growth in FMCG business, growth outlook in the hotel business and paper business and stabilization in the cigarette business. As the growth drivers are broadening, we are increasingly positive on the stock (25x FY20e of earnings) which is trading at a significant discount to the FMCG sector

However, we continue to highlight that 85 percent of the company’s operating profit comes from cigarettes business. And so given the fact that legal cigarettes business is witnessing a fragile recovery, the possibility of higher taxation remains a key business risk.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC reported healthy 6% cigarette volume growth and 8.7% EBIT growth on QoQ improvement in cigarette demand. This has been the highest volume growth since 4QFY12 (6%). Recovery in demand, stabilization of sales mix and cigarette prices and stable taxation regime can result in gradual recovery post 17% decline in volumes in past 5 years. We expect FMCG business led by processed foods to show steady increase in profitability given that some of the businesses like Biscuits and Atta have achieved economies of scale and personal care is stabilizing, however Lifestyle retailing would remain a drag. Paperboard margins are expected to improve given benign input costs and revamp of the 1.5 lakh TPA value added paperboard machine. We expect higher ARR, occupancy rates and growth in F&B sales to improve profitability in Hotels. However, Agri business led by leaf tobacco would take time to recover, despite some relief from INR depreciation.

Outlook

ITC trades at 22.5xSept EPS, 35-40% discount to our coverage universe, which limits downside in the stock. Retain ""Buy"" with SOTP based target price of Rs364 (Rs364 earlier).

The two oldest FMCG conglomerates in India, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) and ITC have reported September quarter results. While HUL's profit beat street expectations, ITC's was in line with average estimates.

For HUL, the home care, personal care, and food items-diversified FMCG, analysts estimated 8.5 percent volume growth and 10 percent overall sales growth for the September quarter. HUL beat this estimates reporting 10 percent volume growth and overall sales growth of 11.5 percent year-on-year. HUL's net profit also beat estimate with 19.5 percent growth.

Oral-care brands Close up, Pepsodent and Aayush are still not meeting internal expectations. But these brands are doing well in central and north India markets.

In the personal wash segment, premium brands such as Pears, Dove, continue to positive results; however, there are a lot of opportunities to improve the growth rate in Lux and Lifebuoy.

In the ice‐cream space, the management highlighted the acquisition of Adityaa Milk Ice Creams, which provides a differentiated business model. It will focus on its core market (Karnataka) along with adjoining markets of Maharashtra, Goa, and Kerala.

In August this year, HUL acquired Karnataka-based ice-cream brand Adityaa from Vijaykant Dairy and Food Products (VDFPL) for an undisclosed amount.

“We estimate better-than-expected volume growth with rural (demand) improving and return of price hikes,” brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities said in its HUL review report.

Rural pull

The core business of HUL has shown a geographical expansion with many products ranges appealing to rural India.

Commenting on the results, Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman and Managing Director, HUL, said, “Rural growth is ahead of urban growth by 1.25 times (in the September quarter). But we will have to wait and see how the rural demand scenario pans out in the forthcoming quarters.""

It is generally observed that rural growth is dependent on the monsoons. While some areas recorded adequate rainfall, as per Skymet estimates, overall rainfall is recorded at 91 percent.

ITC

Kolkata-based ITC, which has since long diversified from a cigarette company to hotel chains, food and paper products, and fragrance materials, reported 15.4 percent revenue growth and 11.9 percent profit rise, largely in line with consensus estimates.

Revenue of non-cigarette FMCG grew double-digit, a healthy sign of the company’s future growth trajectory.

With travel and tourism increasing in India, the hospitality business also posted 20 percent plus growth. ITC is a successful case study in the modernisation of business through winning diversification to the extent that the share of old tobacco line of business has shrunk.

In the last 8 years, its dominance has reduced from 62 percent to 40 percent now.

Together, fast-moving consumer goods, hotels, and agriculture segments contribute around 50 percent to the total sales, while cigarettes make up for 40 percent of the top line. Sales of paperboards, paper and packaging contribute the balance and rose 9 percent on year during the quarter.

Although the Kerala floods did affect HUL and ITC's sales and stockpiles, the overall impact was limited.

In terms of ITC, Kotak Securities in its brokerage report stated, “We have tweaked our forecasts marginally and raise our September 2019E (estimated) fair value target to Rs 330/share from Rs 310 earlier.

“We value the cigarette business at 24X post-tax EBIT and the FMCG business at 5X EV/sales. We remain positive; ITC is the only large-cap stock in the sector where the current valuations factor in a less-than-super-optimistic view of the future,” Kotak Securities added.

Competition from unorganised segment

That said, the two doyens of FMCG business in India continue to face stiff price competition from the unorganised sector and product range competition for unlisted ones like Patanjali.

The future long-term trajectory of FMCGs in India depends on their timely entry in new product ranges at competitive prices that cater to the rising lifestyles of urban and rural India.

HUL and ITC's history in the country dates back to the pre-independence era and they are by far, the only two listed Indian FMCG companies with maximum product range."

Brokerage houses remained bullish on ITC after steady growth in second quarter earnings, as risk-reward is favourable and the stock is available at big discount to other FMCG players. The stock gained a percent intraday on Monday.

With having a buy call and target price of Rs 340 per share, Citi said Q2 was a steady quarter with healthy cigarette volume growth.

It feels the positive trend in cigarette volumes is a near-term catalyst. ""The company is trading below 5-year mean P/E valuation and 30-35 percent discount to peer group is compelling.""

Morgan Stanley, which has overweight call on the stock with a target price at Rs 320, said the stable cigarette volume environment may allow company for calibrated price hikes.

The reported cigarette volume growth stood at 6 percent against its 5 percent estimate and adjusted cigarette EBIT growth of 10 percent ahead of its 9.3 percent estimate, the brokerage house said.

Cigarettes business, which contributed 45 percent to total revenue, has registered a 10.4 percent increase at Rs 5,026 crore with its reported EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) rising 8.7 percent, but margin declining 10 bps compared to same period last fiscal.

Cigarette segment has delivered second consecutive quarter of positive volume growth, said ICICI Direct Research which believes the company should be able to end the year at a full year volume growth of 3-4 percent.

The research house continued to remain positive on the company given robust and encouraging growth numbers coming from its core segments.

The cigarette-hotel-to-FMCG major ITC has reported a 11.9 percent on year growth in second quarter profit to Rs 2,954.67 crore, driven by cigarettes, FMCG and paper segments.

Revenue from operations during the quarter grew by 7.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 11,069 crore with cigarette, hotels and agri segments growing in double-digit.

Overall company's EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased 11.8 percent to Rs 4,206 crore and margin expanded by 150 bps to 38 percent compared to year-ago.

ITC said its FMCG business reported revenue at Rs 8,186 crore, a growth of 11.3 percent over corresponding quarter last year. Paper segment revenue, which contributed nearly 13 percent to total business, increased 8.8 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,424 crore and its EBIT grew by 13.4 percent with margin rising 90 bps in Q2.

BNP Paribas expects double-digit EBIT growth to continue. ITC is its top FMCG pick as the stock is trading below its 5-year average 1-year forward PE and other consumer stocks in its coverage are trading between average & +1 standard deviation.

It believes cigarette operating profit growth is set to improve. It has a buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 347 per share.

Macquarie has maintained its outperform rating on the stock with a target price at Rs 367 as it feels Q2 saw strong recovery in cigarette volume & EBIT growth and FMCG business continued on significantly improved profitability track.

While having a buy call with a target price of Rs 360 per share, Jefferies said cigarettes growth tad below its estimates and others showed positive trend, but it remained positive on ITC given improving business performance in FY19 and favourable risk-reward at current levels.

Stock remains a good defensive play amidst volatile markets, it believes.

IDFC Securities said Q2 results were a mixed bag but the stock is at a 35-40 percent discount to the average of FMCG coverage universe and hence believes risk reward is favourable. It has maintained outperform rating on the stock with a target price at Rs 322 per share.

CLSA has retained its Buy call on ITC with a target price at Rs 390 per share. Update on disaster cess is the key event to watch in the near term, it feels.

The RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's intervention to ensure that the controlling stake in multi-business conglomerate ITC does not go to a foreign company.

The SJM wrote to Modi in the wake of reports of a possible takeover of ITC by British American Tobacco Company (BAT), a UK-based multi-national firm.

""Swadeshi Jagran Manch requests you to kindly intervene in this case in national interest, and pass instructions to increase the shareholding of the government to thwart the possibility of a takeover of an Indian company (ITC) by an MNC,"" its co-convener Ashwani Mahajan said in the letter to Modi.

BAT already holds stake in the ITC, which has diversified business in a range of sectors including FMCG, apparel, hotels, specialty papers, packaging, agri-business and information technology among others.

Referring to ITC's shareholding pattern, he said shares held by domestic financial institutions used to be 32 percent which has come down to 30.4 percent.

BAT's stake is at 29.60 percent in the company.

As a consequence of the share sales management by agencies, the shareholding of public sector financial institutions and the government of India in ITC has come down significantly, narrowing the gap between the shareholding of the government of India and its institutions and BAT, Mahajan said.

""This has increased the risk of the possible takeover of management by the foreign company BAT, by virtue of the fact that BAT would become the dominant shareholder and the company will go into the hands of foreign management, and for all practical purposes, become a foreign company, which at present is an Indian company with an Indian soul,"" Mahajan claimed in the letter."

After hitting a high on August 28, market has been grappling with volatility with S&P BSE Sensex seeing a steep fall of over 4,000 points, or little over 10 percent.

And, if experts are to be believed, the volatility is not over yet and we could see a retest of support levels in near future or at least before the general elections in 2019.

Dividend-paying stocks make an ideal portfolio play in such times of crisis. These stocks tend to absorb the volatility and remain relatively stronger in such a scenario, but at the same time, they are low-return stocks.

“Change in portfolio strategy is not warranted but in a volatile market, investors can deploy short-term strategy with a view of safeguarding long-term objective of the portfolio. Keeping this view, it is prudent to allocate not more than 15-20 percent of overall portfolio to high dividend paying stocks having a well-established business,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“Although it will potentially provide investors with tangible returns, irrespective of market condition, a payout is not always assured or guaranteed. Thus, if investors have a long-term view coupled with stocks backed by strong fundamentals having a growth potential in the portfolio, a short-term event should not concern objective,” he said.

In a strong equity market, where stocks have delivered good capital appreciation, investors may not have paid attention to dividends. But, when investors face the heat of a sell-off, these stocks usually come back in favour.

If we take re-invested dividends into account, at a time when Sensex rose at a 12.6 percent CAGR over the last 5 years, total shareholder returns over the same period were 14.1 percent CAGR, according to a report by Karvy Stock Broking.

“This adds up over time — an investment of Rs 100 made 20 years ago would be worth Rs 1,250, with reinvested dividends, the value of the investment would be Rs. 1,735. Investing in stocks with healthy dividend yields and high dividend payouts is a stable form of investing,” it added.

In the current economy, where bank fixed deposits offer interest rates to the tune of 6-7%, investing in stocks with a good investment yield is good. “We recommend that investors consider adding high dividend yield stocks to their portfolio to bring in regular inflows. We offer a list of 10 stocks with high yields,” said the Karvy report.

Dividend-paying stocks have two basis components – Dividend payout ratio and dividend yield.

Dividend Payout ratio is basically how much money a company is willing to give back to its shareholders from its net profit.

“Investors should also pay attention to the amount the company wants to use for reinvesting in the business, paying off the debt and transferring it to reserves. For example:- if a company has incurred a profit of Rs 1,000 million during a year and it is paying Rs 400 million as dividends then its dividend payout ratio is 40%,” Rahul Sharma, Sr. Technical Research Analyst, Equity99 told Moneycontrol.

On the other hand, when we look at dividend yield it tries to gauge the return on an investment. It can be measures as high yield stock and low yield stock.

“High yield would be something like ITC which gives a significant part of earnings and act as an income stock. While low yield will be those that are giving less dividend and investing most part back into expansion and to improve the bottomline and topline,” Mustafa Nadee, CEO, Epic Research.

“If you are willing to take the risk, one should consider high dividend payout coupled with low yield for a growth as a function. If you are conservative in approach one should look at high yield and high dividend payout ratio,” he said.

Here is a list of 10 stocks identified by Karvy Stock Broking. The brokerage firm has considered the stability of dividends while looking for stocks with high forecast dividend yield:

General Insurance Corp of India: Dividend per share 8.6| Payout: 37.2%

GICRE was incorporated in November 1972 as a part of Government of India’s (GoI) move to nationalise the general insurance business. The majority is owned by GoI and is the dominant Indian reinsurer.

GICRE is present in various segments of reinsurance of which major segments are fire, health, motor, agriculture, marine, aviation, and engineering.

Nifty fell nearly 2 percent, or over 200 points, for the week ended September 28. The index witnessed its fifth consecutive weekly fall.

The index breached its crucial support placed at 11,000 on the weekly basis for the first time since July. The price action on the charts suggest that market is in a downtrend but after falling consecutively for the last 4-5 weeks, a pullback rally could be on the cards.

Bulls should only be able to regain control if the index reclaims 11,170 levels comfortably else we may consolidate around current levels. A close below 10,800 could further extend the selling pressure and take the index towards 10,700-10,600 levels, suggest experts.

""At this juncture after taking a hit of around 8 percent from the highs of 11,760 with 4-weeks of continuous fall, we should expect some pullback rather than looking to go short at current levels,"" Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.

""Bulls should be able to regain control if Nifty50 manages to close above 11,170 levels. If the index closes above 11,17o, the next resistance level stands at 11,350 levels. On signs of weakness around these levels, one can initiate fresh shorts with a target placed between 10,700 and 10,600 kind of levels,"" he said.

Here is a list of top 10 money making ideas by experts which could give 5-16% return in the next 1 month:

Analyst: Jayant Manglik, President, Religare Broking

Lupin: Buy| LTP: Rs 900.9| Initiation range: 890-900| Target: Rs 980| Stop loss: 860| Return: 9%

Lupin witnessed a decent profit taking and found support around the multiple moving averages (200/100/50-EMA) on the daily chart. It is rebounding from thereon and is likely to maintain this bias ahead as well. Traders should use this dip to initiate fresh longs through Call option as per the mentioned levels.

Canara Bank: Sell Futures| Last Close: Rs 221.2| Initiation range: Rs 225-230| Target: Rs 200| Stop Loss: Rs 240| Return: 9.5%

After it failed to cross its resistance hurdle of multiple moving averages around Rs 294, Canara Bank has witnessed a steep fall of late and is likely to maintain this bias ahead too.

Further, we have similar indications from majority PSU banking counters. We advise using any uptick to create fresh shorts within the given range.

Titan Company: Sell Futures| Last Close: Rs 806.8| Initiation range: Rs 815-825| Target: Rs 760| Stop Loss: Rs 840| Return 5%

Titan Company has been consolidating for the past ten months now and has formed a distribution pattern “Head and Shoulder” on the weekly chart. It is trading on the verge of a breakdown from the same and is likely to witness a sharp fall.

The positioning of confirmation indicators is also in sync. Traders should use any bounce to go short in the mentioned zone.

Analyst: Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in

Asian Paints: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,294 | Target: Rs 1,370 | Stop Loss: Rs 1,267 | Return 6%

Last three weeks of price action is looking quite interesting with long lower shadows on the weekly charts which suggest that dips are getting bought into this counter.

Even in the last two sessions, the bulls of this counter remained indifferent to the wild swings witnessed in the broader markets.

Hence, on a sustainable pullback rally, this counter should trade somewhere around Rs 1,377 levels. The near-term strength will get cemented on a close above Rs 1,336 levels. Positional traders should buy into this with a stop of Rs 1,267 for a target of Rs 1,370.

Axis Bank: Buy| LTP: Rs 612 | Target: Rs 649 | Stop Loss: Rs 587 | Return 6%

The price behaviour of the last four sessions in this counter is looking quite interesting as it appears to be building a decent base between Rs 620 – 590 levels from the cushion of which it can rally.

In such a scenario a decent upmove towards Rs 655 can’t be ruled out. Hence, traders are advised to buy into this counter for a target of Rs 649 with a stop of Rs 587.

L&T Finance Holdings: Buy| LTP: Rs 129 | Target: Rs 147 | Stop Loss: Rs 117| Return 14%

This counter appears to have hit a short-term bottom after retracing around 50 percent of its entire up move from the lows of Rs 48 – 213 levels as it is consolidating in a narrow zone of Rs 120 – 135 levels.

On sustaining above Rs 120 levels, it can easily pullback to test its 21st September high of Rs 151 levels. Hence, positional traders can make use of this opportunity to go long for a target of Rs 147 levels with a stop of Rs 117.

Brokerage Firm: Narnolia Financial Advisors Ltd

ITC: Buy| Buy Range: Rs 287-290|Target: Rs 335 | Stop Loss: Rs 267 | Return 16%

Selling in ITC seems to be absorbed by buyers after witnessing almost 50 percent correction from the peak of Rs 323 marks. The stock seems to be bottomed out near 50% Fibonacci retracement of the entire upward swing from Rs 259 to Rs 323 levels which is supportive for the Bulls.

The emergences of Morning Star pattern near the same suggest reversal in the coming sessions. Currently, it is retesting its previous neckline of the Cup and Handle pattern on the weekly chart which is around Rs 288 levels.

Strong support is seen near Rs 280-285 zones where 61.8% Fibonacci retracement is located of the same upward swing. Traders can buy around Rsc290 with a stop loss below Rs 267 and a target of Rs 335.

NTPC: Buy| Buy Range: Rs 160-162|Target: Rs 186| Stop Loss: Rs 149| Return 15%

The stock seems to have bottomed out at the levels Rs 149 mark and from that level, it has given a breakout and surged higher. Currently, inverse Head & Shoulder is emerging on the daily chart in which the right shoulder is still pending.

But, from current levels, the risk-to-reward ratio is looking favorable. Indicators and oscillator are also conducive for the price action. One can take a long position around Rs 162-160 with a stop loss of Rs 149 and a target of Rs 186.

ICICI Bank: Buy| Buy Range: Rs 305| Target: Rs 345| Stop Loss: Rs 285| Return 13%

After the recent fall, the scrip seems to have bottomed out near its channel support line. It found a base near 50% Fibonacci retracement of the upside move from Rs 266 to Rs 346.80 which is giving hope to bulls for making long position in the scrip.

The 200-DMA is seen around Rs 305 levels which is key support. The weekly chart is showing parity with its historical levels. Oversold stochastic is also lending support to its price action. Traders can go long in the stock around Rs 305 levels with a stop loss of Rs 285 and a target of Rs 345 marks.

Mahanagar Gas: Buy| Buy around: Rs 800 |Target: Rs 900| Stop Loss: Rs 755| Return 12.5%

The scrip has given a sharp fall after hitting a peak of Rs 986.80 and it seems to be halting its downswing as it has found a strong base near the levels of Rs 790-800 levels where congestion zone is seen.

Positive divergence is seen in RSI and occurrence of double bottom price pattern indicates upside move. We saw a positive crossover in MACD & the declining histogram imply positive move on the northward side. Traders can buy around Rs 800 with a stop loss of Rs 755 and a target of Rs 900 levels.

Global brokerage house Macquarie has upgraded ITC to Outperform from Neutral rating and also raised target price to Rs 367 from Rs 304, implying potential upside of 24 percent.

The major reason behind its upgrade is the potential improvement in cigarette business which contributed more than 40 percent to total revenue.

""We see improving cigarette volume trends based on channel checks and expect higher visibility of margin improvement in FMCG business,"" Macquarie said.

He believes potential double-digit cigarette EBIT growth will lead to valuation re-rating.

ITC delivered a healthy performance during the quarter amidst subdued demand conditions and continuing pressure on the legal cigarette industry. On a comparable basis, gross sales value (net of rebates/discounts) for April-June quarter stood at Rs 18,171.66 crore, representing a growth of 13.5 percent driven mainly by the agribusiness, FMCG-Others and FMCG-cigarettes Segments.

Profit after tax for the quarter at Rs 2,818.68 crore grew by 10.1 percent, respectively.

At 13:28 hours IST, the stock price was quoting at Rs 295.40, down Rs 1.30, or 0.44 percent on the BSE. In last one month, the stock corrected 5 percent but in last three months, it rallied more than 13 percent."

ITC has reportedly withdrawn from the race to acquire nutritional drink market brands Horlicks and Complan as it considers the valuations of the brands too high, according to a Times of India report.

The diversified conglomerate believes that the brands do not fit its portfolio. However, the company indicated that it would venture into the health food segment and build its own brand.

Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.

ITC had earlier shown interest in GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)-owned Horlicks and Kraft Heinz-owned Complan.

Hemant Malik, divisional chief executive of ITC Foods, told the newspaper, ""These were opportunities that just came up in the last few months. We evaluated and looked at some of these valuations and found the cost of acquisition to be very high. Given the high FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) valuations in India, such acquisitions could be a challenge. In this context, we are not pursuing it.""

In July, ITC had said it is open to acquisition of the Horlicks brand when it is put up for sale, provided the price is ""right"".

According to reports, the Horlicks acquisition received attention from Coca-Cola, Kellogg’s, Nestle, Pepsi, Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever.

Besides ITC, Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting, and Cadila Healthcare are preparing to buy Kraft Heinz India’s nutritional drink.

Complan accounts for approximately 8 percent share of the Rs 5,500 crore nutritional drink market in India.

Besides Complan and Horlicks, the market is dominated by Cadbury’s Bournvita and Nestle’s Boost."

Looking at the recent correction seen in India markets, analysts at Citigroup advise investors to stay with defensive names and with stocks which have earnings visibility for some more time.

The global investment bank, which maintains its Sensex target of 37,300 for March 2019, has removed Yes Bank from its model portfolio post the recent downgrade and added Coal India.

Citigroup feels that volatility could remain a concern in the near term, given high valuations and risks of some moderation in growth in certain segments. Domestic flows have been a big support, but it will be interesting to see if the trend continues.

Citigroup highlights top 10 stock ideas which could give decent risk-to-reward to investors:

Ambuja Cements:

Citigroup expects cement prices to rise over the medium term as M&A activity slows. Additionally, there is a shift in Ambuja’s strategy to focus on profitable growth even though the merger with ACC has been delayed, added the report.

The view is based on 1) strong volume growth since 2017, 2) limestone mines acquisition, 3) plans to commission new clinker capacity and 4) cost focus.

Lafarge’s global strategy includes utilising the best asset base to grow faster than the market, and more investments in growth plus markets (India could benefit). Current valuations provide an attractive entry point.

Coal India (CIL):

CIL’s current valuation are 1-SD below mean and offers a 7 percent dividend yield. Citigroup is constructive on 1) e-auction price support, 2) realization upside from linkage auctions, 3) strong volume growth and 4) limited cost pressures (wage negotiations concluded in FY18).

HDFC:

Citigroup believes that HDFC Ltd will maintain its strong earnings momentum with healthy AuM growth and relatively stable spreads backed by a strong funding franchise.

The company has maintained its spreads in the narrow range of 2.20-2.35 percent over a long period of time irrespective of the interest rate environment. It has a well-balanced ALM profile and is adequately capitalized.

ICICI Bank:

ICICI Bank has been focusing on addressing their corporate asset quality issues which have led to higher slippages/NPA in the past.

The bank is well positioned to leverage its strong liability and retail lending franchise with retail now constituting 58 percent of the total loan book and CASA ratio at 51 percent.

The share of the overseas business, which is lower yielding, continues to decline. With NPA recognition in the last leg, the focus will shift to recoveries and core growth/profitability.

ITC:

ITC is a key holding in the consumer space in our view - positive trends in the key cigarette business, i.e. continued positive volumes are a near-term catalyst, coupled with a stable mix.

This should drive 11% EPS CAGR and 17 percent FCF CAGR respectively over FY18-20E. Valuation discount is compelling vs. peer group. ITC is perhaps the only major consumer stock trading in-line with its last 5 year historical average of 28x 1-year forward P/E.

Maruti Suzuki India:

For the overall Indian PV industry, we expect 10/11% YoY growth in FY19/20 respectively. Maruti should continue to gain market share, given a strong product portfolio. Citigroup expects domestic volume growth rates of 13/12% YoY over FY19/20 respectively.

Currently, the stock is trading at ~12.4x 1-year forward EV/EBITDA, which is close +1 SD above mean but a significant pullback from recent highs of 18x.

While there could be near-term risks to earnings given the way currencies have moved, it does seem adequately priced into the recent stock price moves.

NTPC:

NTPC trades at 10.9x P/E and 1.2x P/BV FY20E. The stock trades 1 standard deviation below historical (since January 2005) mean on both parameters.

Commenting on the business outlook, Citigroup said that Coal related under-recoveries have been more or less resolved from July 2018. Logistical issues faced by NTPC for domestic coal transportation have eased after it signed a MoU with the Indian Railways in Apr18 and paid ~Rs50bn advance towards haulage charges.

NTPC is targeting capacity addition and commercialization of ~4.8GW in FY19E and 4-5GW addition in FY20E. Over the next 3-4 years, capitalization should exceed capex implying RoE expansion as equity invested in under-construction projects starts earning returns.

Petronet LNG:

Petronet LNG is a key beneficiary of India’s rising LNG imports, and its capacity expansion is well timed against this backdrop.

With 90 percent of the post-expansion Dahej capacity already tied up under long-term take-or-pay / use-or-pay contracts and given the significant capital efficiency & scale benefits associated with successive brownfield expansions at the facility, the company offers strong volume and earnings visibility notwithstanding the start-up of new terminals.

Sun TV:

Citigroup thinks that the stock price correction on a YTD basis is overdone and the current valuations at 15x FY20E EPS are attractive, pricing in most concerns. Earnings delivery is expected to be healthy as ad momentum sustains.

Tamil Nadu digitalization boosts domestic subscription revenues (~Rs3.8bn additional revenues by FY20E). The global investment bank estimates 13%/19% consolidated revenue / EPS CAGR over FY18-20E.

UPL:

Citigroup expects 13 percent revenue CAGR with 140bps of improvement in margin over FY18-20E (without incorporating the recent Arysta acquisition), largely driven by higher volumes and market share, the introduction of more proprietary products and better cost efficiencies.

The India season was good and early signs from Latin America (largest market) are encouraging as well, pointing to good earnings momentum over the rest of FY19.

The global investment bank believes UPL’s well-diversified business model is resilient to transient market disruptions and would allow it to consistently grow ahead of the market.

JM Financial's research report on ITC

The GST Council is scheduled to meet coming Friday, Sep 28th to, inter alia, decide on a way to raise funds to help re-build Kerala after the state faced massive losses from severe flooding last month (Aug’18). The natural consequence of this is, expectedly, renewed pressure on ITC’s share price. Interestingly, the GST Council may not need any parliamentary approval for this additional levy since Article 279A of the Constitution has already been amended to allow the GST Council to recommend ‘any special rate or rates for a specified period, to raise additional resources during any natural calamity or disaster’. We expect the stock to recover once the event is out of the way this week, as we do not expect the fresh levy to be all that severe (mid to high single-digit price hike would be enough to offset the impact, we believe) and more importantly, we do not think any new tax arising out of this event is a signal of any change in the government’s recent more-benign stance on tobacco taxation.

Outlook

One point we would agree, though, is that frequent calling on tobacco companies to act akin to ‘the lender of last resort’ is not too good for the stock’s PE multiple over the medium-term, since taxes of any kind, once levied, tends to be permanent.

We find that there is a strong support at 10,800 and Nifty should maintain this level but if breached, 10,500 will be next support level. On the upside, 11,500 is the resistance level and looking at the current global and domestic scenario, Nifty will hover around 11,000-mark, said Shreyansh N Mehta, Manager Equity Research at AUM Capital Market in an interview to Moneycontrol's Sunil Shankar Matkar.

Do you think we are near bottom in terms of correction? What is your overall view for the rest of FY19?

Indian equity market remained highly volatile since February 2018 triggered by uncertainty around the globe. Recently Nifty tested its all-time high crossing 11,750 mark and outperforming all global major markets.

It was mainly due to better-than-expected Q1 results and normal monsoon but soon a correction of around 400 points was noticed and again a bounce back is observed. This movement is mainly due to the weaker Indian rupee against US dollar, rising of crude prices and global trade war.

We find that there is a strong support at 10,800 and Nifty should maintain this level but if breached, 10,500 will be next support level. On the upside, 11,500 is the resistance level and looking at the current global and domestic scenario, Nifty will hover around 11,000-mark.

Geopolitical uncertainties might escalate further which will keep the market volatile but the domestic picture looks encouraging.

Recovery in earning is expected to gather pace in FY19 on the back of the government focus on affordable housing and higher MSP for farm produce.

Moreover, rise in India's growth trajectory is expected to boost market sentiment and thus with the bullish view we hope the market will soon cross the 12,000 milestone.

Is rupee a bigger risk than crude and trade war tensions? Will weak rupee have major impact on CAD?

The Indian rupee has become Asia's worst performer losing over 13 percent of its value in 2018 breaching new highs against the dollar on rising crude oil prices and falling emerging market currencies and there seems to be no end to it.

Though, the Indian currency recovered some lost ground on suspected dollar sales by the Reserve Bank of India but there are still dark clouds in the sky as fears of escalating trade war could further hurt the global market sentiments and growth.

Not to forget, the massive liquidation by the foreign investors and political uncertainty around 2019 general elections in India will further put pressure on rupee. So, as of now, rupee will maintain this downward trend approaching fast towards 74–75 levels and will create a threat on the economy as a whole.

But going forward, in a span of 6-9 months, we might again see rupee trading around 70.

Rise in the global oil prices, when coupled with a sharp depreciation in the rupee and other macroeconomic events, creates a double blow for the CAD which increased to a four-quarter high. Pressure on the currency spikes the country’s import bill even though the volume of import may remain the same and thus India's CAD might overshoot Centre’s estimates.

FIIs have been sellers in recent times. Do you think the momentum is likely to continue?

FIIs have been net sellers, not only in India but across the whole emerging economies. If we look at the trend of FIIs and DIIs ownership in last few years, it's clear that the DIIs are becoming significant players in the Indian market and making up for the loss.

Nonetheless, despite the volatility, India is believed to be a preferred investment destination for investors on the back of implementation of government reforms.

After two rate hikes, do you expect the RBI to go for another hike or more than one hike by FY19?

Further headwinds such as state and centre elections due in 2018-19, a widening CAD, expected rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, rising crude oil prices, weak investor sentiment, elevated bond yields and depreciating rupee may lead to one more rate hike this year.

Is it time to invest in IT and pharma stocks?

Depreciating rupee will benefit export-oriented companies which earn most of their revenues in US dollar. Thus, majorly IT and pharma sectors are likely to see boosting their margins.

We recommend keeping the stocks of both the sectors in the portfolio as a defensive measure, but rather than going sector-specific, one should be more focused on individual companies.

What are the top five picks for next one year?

We recommend to buy the following stocks with an upside potential of around 10-15 percent from the current level with an investment horizon of 9-12 months.

Balkrishna Industries

Balkrishna Industries (BKIL) is a leading manufacturer in the off-highway tyres. The management's consistent effort to lower debt through internal accruals should help in increasing the margins.

BKIL is also exploring other related segments such as earthmovers & mining tyres to push the top line growth further. With gradual improvement in replacement demand and improved prospects of the user industry like mining and construction, the company is poised to grow faster than the industry. Deleveraging of balance sheet, increased capacity, lower costs, healthy return ratios justify its valuations when compared to other tyre stocks.

Bandhan Bank

Bandhan Bank's distribution network is particularly strong and largest in East and Northeast India. Its unique business model with immense growth potential in microfinance segment and expansion into other retail and SME lending provides attractive and profitable opportunities.

Its extensive & low-cost distribution network with enhancement in digital platform, superior return ratios, pristine asset quality, improving funding and increasing average loan size makes Bandhan an outlier in the microfinance segment.

CESC

CESC recently received NCLT's approval for demerger of the company into four different entities. Its retail business under the Spencer's brand is EBIDTA positive and it expects cash break-even in coming few quarters.

Many new launches in retail segment along with expansion plans through acquisitions, residential projects and plant set up program in the books would boost up the growth and numbers. Further, the demerger would drive value through unlocking of the potential of the Distribution and Retail businesses.

ITC

It is believed that the expected revival in rural economy, increased realisation of cigarettes and improving profitability of hotels segment would aid healthy growth for ITC.

Moreover, the company’s exploration towards other sectors and continuous R&D in innovative launches of the existing FMCG products would provide a boost in the numbers.

Jindal Steel and Power

Jindal Steel and Power is driving an ambitious global expansion plan which includes expanding its core areas and diversifying into new businesses.

JSPL's domestic increase in steel and power production, reducing debt, curtailed working capital, expanding capacity at Angul and Raigarh plants and scope for further cost reduction with replacement of thermal coal with pet coke in coal gasifiers would ramp up its production along with better cost of production.

The ready-to-drink, milk-based beverage space is likely to see heightened competition ahead among players such as Amul, Britannia Industries and Coca-Cola as ITC looks to foray into this space. The Kolkata-based multi-business enterprise is set to launch its new product range - Sunfeast Wonderz - next month, as per a report in The Economic Times.

As per the report, the company claims said its new product is different from existing beverages in the category as it contain real fruit pulp versus artificial flavours used in existing products.

ITC will manufacture the beverage range at its new facility in Kapurthala, Punjab, where it has invested in an aseptic pet facility, it said.

At first, the company will launch the product in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Later, the product is likely to be rolled out across the nation.

Asked about venturing into ready to drink milk beverages, Hemant Malik, Divisional Chief Executive – Foods at ITC, said the market for the product has seen ""high growth in the recent past, with a paradigm shift to healthier beverages. We believe innovative offerings in this segment could have great potential in the future.""

According to a survey conducted by global market intelligence agency Mintel, there was an increase in share of flavoured milk products in dairy drink introductions in India to 39 percent in 2017 as against 20 percent in 2012."

KR Choksey's research report on ITC

ITC posted its Q1FY19 results which were in line with our estimates, revenue stood at INR 107 Bn (+7.6% YoY). The top line was mainly driven by Food-FMCG, Hotels and Agri segment, which grew by 10.3%, 12% & 14% YoY respectively, this was mainly due to revival in consumer demand and increase in room occupancy rate. EBIDTA stood at INR 42 Bn (+12% YoY), with OPM at 39.2% (+161 bps YoY). Lower operating overheads (-3% YoY) has resulted in better margins. PAT for Q1FY19 stood at INR 28.2 Bn (+10.1% YoY), with NPM at 26.3% (+60 bps YoY). Lower interest expenses (-29.3% YoY) resulted in higher PAT.

Outlook

At the CMP of INR 300, ITC is trading at an P/E of 29.7x for FY20E, we assign a P/E multiple of 34.5x to arrive at a target price of INR 350 recommending a ‘BUY’ rating on the stock representing a potential upside of 16.7%.

HDFC Securities's research report on ITC

ITC’s net revenues grew by 13.5% (exp of 8.2%) beating estimates for all segments except Paper business. Cigarette value growth was at ~9% (exp. 8%) with volume growth of ~1% (exp. flat). EBITDA/ APAT grew by 7/10% vs. exp. of 12/10%. ITC has consistently improved cigarette performance after seeing steep rise in taxes in FY18. As per the management, cigarette volume trajectory is gradually improving. Therefore, we believe ITC can deliver low-mid single digit volume growth in the coming 3-4 quarters supported by favourable base (-6/-4-3% in 2Q/3Q/4QFY19) and expectation of no steep rise in taxes (healthy GST collections).

Outlook

At 26x FY20E EPS, ITC trades at an unfair discount of ~35% to the sector. Reiterate BUY. Our TP is Rs 367, at 32x Jun-20E EPS.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC reported 1.5% cigarette volume growth and 8.7% EBIT growth on QoQ improvement in cigarette demand. Stabilization of sales mix and relatively stable taxation regime can result in steady improvement post 17% decline in volumes in past 5 years. We expect FMCG business led by processed foods to show steady increase in profitability given that some of the businesses like Biscuits and Atta have achieved economies of scale and personal care is stabilizing, however Lifestyle retailing would remain a near term drag. Paperboard business is expected to improve margins given benign input costs, benefits from capacity expansions of the Décor machine and revamp of the paperboard machine. We expect higher ARR and occupancy rates to improve profitability in Hotels. Agri business led by leaf tobacco will show slow recovery, despite some relief from INR depreciation.

Outlook

ITC trades at 24.2xFY20 EPS, 40-45% discount to our coverage universe, which limits downside in the stock. Retain ""Buy"" with SOTP based target price of Rs346. Steep increase in cigarette taxes are a key risk to our call.

Edelweiss' research report on ITC

ITC’s Q1FY19 revenue, EBITDA and PAT growth of 7.6%, 12.2% and 10.1% YoY, respectively, came in line with our estimates. After four quarters, cigarette volumes were encouraging—1.5% YoY volume growth versus our and Street’s expectations of 1-2% YoY dip. With no increase in tax rate for more than a year, demand is turning positive. The FMCG business also did well with underlying sales jumping 14.3% YoY. Management, for the first time, disclosed EBITDA margin of the FMCG business—4.5%, up 181bps YoY. EBIT growth was at eight quarters’ high (except for a quarter which had benefit of soft base) riding mix enrichment and cost management initiatives. Owing to regulated nature of the business (cigarette), we maintain ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

However, with cigarette still contributing ~85% to EBIT, reliance on regulated business remains high. Hence, we maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ and value ITC on SOTP on FY20E to arrive at target price of INR328.

Brokerage houses remained bullish on the stock, saying potential re-rating is likely going ahead after strong performance in Q1. They expect the stock to return up to 25 percent over a period of one year.

Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 335 | Return: 17%

Q1FY19 earnings were ahead of estimates and it is a good start to FY19. Cigarette business reported good performance with surprising volume growth while FMCG others business reported impressive revenue growth and profitability.

Paper division has good margin delivery while hotel division was good.

Brokerage: UBS | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 350 | Return: 22%

Overall performance was creditable, as it came on a normalised base. Positive cigarette volume growth of 2 percent could improve from here.

Brokerage: Kotak Institutional Equities | Rating: Add | Target: Rs 330 | Return: 15%

Q1 earnings print was ahead of expectations with positive cigarette volume growth and modest EBIT growth.

Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 345 | Return: 20%

ITC can outperform the sector over next 6-9 months and continues to like the stock given favourable risk-reward.

Cigarette-to-soap maker ITC is likely to report a year-on-year rise of 8.96 percent in its net profit for the June quarter to Rs 2,790 crore, according to an average of 13 brokerages' estimates compiled by Reuters.

The rise in the company's bottom line is expected to be driven by growth in the its non-cigarette businesses on the back of a favourable base, and improved realisation from cigarettes.

ITC is scheduled to detail its earnings for the June quarter on July 26.

Underpinned by growth in the non-cigarette segment and hikes in the prices of cigarettes, the Kolkata-based company's net sales for the quarter are seen coming in at Rs 9,876 crore, 6 percent higher on year.

Its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) is expected to fall 4.11 percent YoY to Rs 4,049 crore.

Most brokerages have stated that the company is likely to report a year-on-year fall in sales of cigarettes. Cigarette sale volumes in the April-June quarter are likely to decline 1-2 percent.

Brokerage ICICIDirect has taken a contrarian view and estimated a rise of 2 percent in cigarette sale volumes, mainly due to last year's favorable base.

However, no hike in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on cigarettes after the initial one in 2017 is seen as positive for the company.

ITC's cigarette business is considered crucial for its performance as it accounted for nearly 52 percent of its top line and 79 percent of its profit before tax (PBT) in FY18.

""The management has shifted its focus from cigarettes business to grow its fast moving consumer goods business and its target is to become the largest player in the segment,"" KR Choksey Research said in a report.

ITC is a diversified conglomerate that also has business interests in fast moving consumer goods, paper, hotels, and agriculture. According to analysts, most of these businesses are expected to report healthy growth.

The key trends to watch out for in the results will be a trend in sale volumes of cigarettes, operating margins for the FMCG segment, and the outlook on the agriculture and hospitality businesses, along with the profitability of each segment."

Initial data indicates long rollover to August series which also reflects that at current levels there is a lot of outstanding short positions on the Nifty. So, we can expect another round of short covering ahead of July expiry.

As per current derivative data, the Nifty can move towards 11,200-11,220 levels this week as the market undertone remains bullish. We expect the bullish scenario to continue with the index having multiple supports at lower levels around 11,100 and 11,050 spot.

Options writers were seen active in the recent rally as we have seen put writing in 11,100 and 11,000 strikes along with the call unwinding.

On the technical front, Nifty has a strong support at 11,100-11,080 spot levels. The current trend is likely to continue towards 11,200-11,220 in the expiry week.

Exide Industries: Buy| Target: Rs 303| Stop Loss: Rs 252| Return 12%

The stock has been maintaining its uptrend ever since breakout above Rs 240 levels has been seen in the prices in the recent past.

However, after eight weeks of prolong consolidation in the range of Rs 245-270, the stock has once again given a fresh breakout last week along with marginally higher volumes.

Additionally, the fresh breakout has also been observed above the symmetrical triangle pattern which signifies that bulls are once again active in the scrip. Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs 270-273 for the target of Rs 303 and a stop loss below Rs 252.

Apollo Tyres: Buy | Target: Rs 300 | Stop Loss: Rs 255| Return 11%

It surpassed its short and long-term moving averages as well. Additionally, the stock has also witnessed a breakout above the inverted head and shoulder pattern on the daily charts.

Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 270-275 for the upside target of Rs 300 and a stop loss below Rs 255.

Combined market capitalisation of nine of the 10 most valued companies surged by a whopping Rs 1,58,882.34 crore last week, helped by an overall strong broader market and smart surge in the valuation of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).

Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are expected to see a further uptick in volume growth in the first quarter, aided by a pickup in the underlying demand and driven by improvement in rural markets.

The earnings for the FMCG sector will kick-start with industry giant Hindustan Unilever reporting its first-quarter (April-June) results on July 16.

According to various analysts reports, the volume growth will also be pushed by a favourable base, given the destocking at trade channels prior to Goods and Services Tax (GST) implementation in Q1FY18.

The government had implemented GST across the country from July 1, 2017.

Almost all analysts expect a high single to double-digit volume growth within the FMCG sector in April-June quarter of FY19.

According to IDFC Securities, ""In terms of input costs, prices of crude and crude-linked commodities will continue to inch up, which could impact gross margins in the sector sequentially.""

However, a favorable price/mix and moderation in palm oil prices (down ~14 percent year-on-year) will curtail the impact on gross margins for home and personal care players, the report stated

While inflation in agri-commodities could adversely impact Marico’s gross margins, moderation in prices of milk and skimmed milk powder (SMP) will continue to benefit food players like Nestle.

However, the benefit of operating leverage, GST-led savings as well as focus on cost efficiencies could result in year-on-year (YoY) expansion in the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margins in Q1FY19.

Most brokerage firms estimate sales, EBITDA and profit after tax (PAT) growth of 11 percent, 20 percent, and 18 percent YoY, respectively, for Q1FY19.

Major players

Hindustan Unilever, India's biggest consumer goods company, had reported a 9.3 percent YoY rise in net profit to Rs 1,283 crore for the first quarter that ended in June 2017.

Dabur and ITC are expected to post double-digit earnings growth within the consumer staples universe in Q1FY19, while Nestle and Godrej Consumer are expected to outperform with strong 43 percent, and 20 percent YoY earnings growth, respectively, during the quarter.

In Q1FY17, Dabur India posted a fall of 10 percent in its net profit to Rs 264.86 crore, while cigarette-to-soap maker ITC had reported 7.4 percent jump in net profit at Rs 2,560.5 crore."

ITC is all set to open its first luxury hotel in Goa after it takes over the 252-room sea-facing resort property currently run by US-based hotel chain Hyatt under the Park Hyatt brand.

The company will take over Hyatt's beach front (Arossim beach) property located at Cansaulim, South Goa in September. It will run the hotel, which has 5 suites and 9 food and beverage options, under the brand ITC Grand.

Although the Kolkata-based company already has an operational property in Goa under the mid-market brand Fortune, the state remains the most under-represented for ITC in terms of hotels.

The company has a collection of 12 luxury hotel properties across Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Jaipur.

ITC bought the Park Hyatt property from its owners Blue Coast Hotels through an auction held by IFCI (the erstwhile Industrial Finance Corporation of India) for Rs 541 crore in 2015.

But the promoters of Blue Coast Hotels moved courts to stall the sale, stating that the property has been undervalued by IFCI and that it was worth Rs 1,200 crore.

The hotel was kept as collateral against a loan taken from IFCI. But earlier this year, ITC won the case along with a guarantee that the property be handed over to it within six months.

""We regret to inform you that we anticipate a change in ownership and management of the hotel on September 19, 2018. From and after this date, the hotel is expected to no longer be affiliated with Hyatt,"" Hyatt said in an advisory.

ITC's hotels business is currently concentrated in India. The company operates 107 properties under four distinct brands – 'ITC Hotel' in the luxury segment, 'WelcomHotel' in the upper-upscale segment, 'Fortune' in the mid-market-to-upscale segment, and 'WelcomHeritage' in the leisure and heritage segment.

The company currently has 9,500 rooms across its properties and plans to add another 2,500 rooms in five years to take the total count to 12,000. A total of 24 new properties will be added by ITC, all of which are currently in various stages of construction, and are a mix of managed and owned."

Dolat Capital's research report on ITC

ITC extended the newly acquired Charmis brand to a range of skincare products that would compete with HUL’s Pond’s and Nivea, and help scale up its presence in the high-margin personal-care business. It has also acquired floor cleaning brand Nimyle from Kolkata-based Arpita Agro Products. Amidst competitive pressure, it will take ~3-4 years with strong distribution for ITC to become a significant player in the categories.

Outlook

We anticipate consumer shift from bidi to cigarette as well as to branded FMCG products which is likely to improve company’s profitability. Maintain Accumulate.

JM Financial's research report on ITC

The GST Council’s (perhaps unintentional?) u-turn on cigarette taxation immediately post GST rollout ensured that government retained a lion’s share of ITC’s value-addition. Over the past 5 years, 73% of the total value-added by ITC accrued to the government (‘value-added’ defined as the value created by the economic activities of the company and its employees). ITC contributed a cumulative INR 1.5tn (USD 23bn) to the Exchequer over the past 5 years (FY14-18) during which period its own profits were just INR477bn (USD 7.3bn) - share of the government in the value-added by ITC is 3.5x the amount that accrued to the providers of capital. Taking the cigarettes business alone, for every rupee of profit that the cigarettes business earned in FY18, the government made 3.6x. From a CF perspective, ITC managed a 20% growth in cashflow from operations (pre-exceptional basis) despite a mere 6.8% growth in operating profit - a large part of this delta was due to timing of payout of GST liabilities vs excise, as reflected in higher ‘statutory liabilities’ in Mar’18 BS.

In a bid to become India’s biggest fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, ITC is planning to explore entry into more consumer categories and launch 30-40 new products each year, according to a report by The Economic Times.

“To achieve our revenue target of Rs 1 lakh crore by 2030 from the new FMCG businesses, we are strengthening our existing categories and venturing into newer ones,” B Sumant, president of the FMCG business, told the newspaper.

“A lot of resources are being invested in product development with a strong R&D team,” Sumant added.

The Kolkata-based conglomerate is likely to have 60-65 percent of the new launches in the packaged food segment which contributes over 22 percent to its net revenue. The revenue from the packaged food segment is next only to the cigarette business, which contributes to 46 percent of the net revenue of the company, according to the report.

ITC is looking to plug gaps in its portfolio but will only acquire brands that can be scaled up using its own distribution network, the report adds.

The firm’s current products in the FMCG segment include cigarettes, personal care, stationery and packaged food, among others. In the previous financial year, the company launched 30 products, second to only rival Patanjali Ayurved."

ITC Limited said it planned to add 2,500 rooms to its hotel segment to take the total inventory to 12,000 in five years from 9,500 now, even as the diversified group mulls foraying into the healthcare space.

Sanjiv Puri, ITC Managing Director, said the company would invest Rs 2,500 crore in the next two to three years in Telangana, among others, to set up an integrated consumer goods manufacturing unit and logistics facility and for the capacity augmentation and efficiency of Bhadrachalam Paperboard.

He said ITC appointed a committee internally to examine the possibility of foraying into the healthcare space. Once it submitted its report, the Board would examine it and take a final call.

""Currently we have four brands under ITC hotels. Some are owned and some are managed. We currently have 107 hotels with 9,500 rooms. In the next five years, we can add another 24 hotels which are at various stages of construction, both owned and managed. It will bring another 2,500 rooms. This would take to roughly 130 hotels with 12,000 rooms,"" he said.

ITC's hotel group operates under four distinct brands -- 'ITCHotel' at the luxury end, 'WelcomHotel' in the 5-star segment, 'Fortune' in the mid-market to upscale segment and WelcomHeritage' in the heritage leisure segment.

ITC formally inaugurated ITC Kohenur at a cost of Rs 775 crore. The hotel has 271 rooms, suites and service apartments. Puri said ITC earlier said it would invest Rs 25,000 crore over the next five years in various sectors, of which Rs 10,000 crore would be invested in food processing.

""Our vision is to build 20 integrated consumer goods manufacturing and logistics hubs in the country. Some of them are under construction,"" he added. Earlier, in his inaugural address, Telangana Minister K T Rama Rao asked ITC Chairman Y C Deveshwar to look into the possibility of helping the revival of Ballarpur Industries Limited (BILT) unit near Warangal.

The Minister also said the revival of the plant would help 2000 of its employees get employment. BILT shut down its pulp manufacturing factory at Kamalapuram in 2014, citing losses. Reacting to the Ministers request, Deveshwar said they would look into it if the state government comes out with some sops for the unit's revival.

On investments in Telangana, Puri said ITC had invested about Rs 2,500 crore in the state, including for the hotel in Kohenur. ""A similar investment is underway in the form of integrated consumer goods manufacturing unit and logistics facility and for capacity augmentation and efficiency of Bhadrachalam paperboard,"" he said.

ITC has a speciality paper and paperboard manufacturing unit near Bhadrachalam in Telangana. To a query, Puri said the cigarette industry is under a lot of pressure due to the steep increase in taxation. He said 80 percent of ITC's capital employed is in the non-cigarettes business."

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

We reiterate BUY on ITC given that the stock is available at 22.4x FY20 EPS (50% discount to large cap consumer names) and offers 2% dividend yield due to FEAR related to cigarette tax increases. However, we expect relatively moderate increase in cigarette taxes in medium term given 1) Rs200bn surplus and robust compensation cess collections in April and May 2018 and 2) 18-40% advalorem component in cigarette GST. We estimate 3% volume growth and double digit EBIT growth in cigarettes given low base and improved product mix. (FY18, 6.6% EBIT growth on 3.3% volume decline). FMCG business is on cusp of sharp improvement in profits (est 2x growth in 3 years) given rising scale and peaked out losses in personal care and Lifestyle retailing. Paperboard business is expected to improve margins given benign input costs, benefits from refurbishment of Décor machine and expected capacity expansion.

Outlook

We expect higher ARR and occupancy rates to improve profitability in Hotels. Lower production and high prices of leaf tobacco in India will drag Agri business, despite some relief from INR depreciation. Retain ""Buy"" with SOTP based target price of Rs346.For all recommendations report, click here

Leading exchange BSE today began a mock trading session for further funds offer of the Bharat-22 exchange traded fund (ETF). The mock session would be conducted tomorrow as well.

In November last year, the government had launched Bharat-22 ETF comprising shares of 22 companies, including public sector undertakings (PSUs), public sector banks, ITC, Axis Bank and L&T. Now, it has launched the follow-on offer through which it is expected to raise up to Rs 8,400 crore.

In a notice, the BSE said the mock session is being conducted to familiarise the participants with the new segment on its web based platform -- iBBS (internet based-book building software) -- for subscription and bidding of further funds offer of the Bharat 22 ETF on BiMF module.

""The BiMF (BSE iBBS platform for mutual fund) module on iBBS platform can be accessed through internet and leased line,"" the exchange said, adding that no separate registration is required to access it.

The exchange has also requested all the trading members to give their feedback of the mock session.

In a separate notice, BSE also said that the subscription for further funds offer (FFO) of the Bharat 22 ETF will commence from June 20 and remain open till June 22 on BiMF module on iBBS platform.

The issue would open for the anchor investors tomorrow and would be available for other institutional and retail investors from Wednesday.

The investors would get a 2.5 per cent discount over the issue price.

A finance ministry official had said last week that the government is aiming at mopping up Rs 6,000 crore, with a green-shoe option to retain another Rs 2,400 crore from the Bharat-22 ETF follow on offer to be launched on June 19.

This offer would also help the government in meeting the minimum public holding norm in PSUs like Coal India.

The state-owned companies or PSUs that are part of the new Bharat ETF-22 include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

The other central public sector enterprises on the list are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index."

The Nifty is now trading above its crucial short-term moving averages and today’s intraday low of 10,524 will be of big importance in the coming week, suggest experts. A break below this level could again put further pressure on the index amid expiry week volatility.

On the upside, the next target for the index is placed at 10,733 levels but bulls will be able to take full control of the index if it surpasses 10,929 which was recorded on May 15, 2018.

The Nifty which opened at 10,533 slipped marginally to hit an intraday low of 10,524. Bulls took control of the index and pushed Nifty above 10,600 to hit an intraday high of 10,628 before closing the day at 10,605, up 91 points.

According to Pivot charts, the key support level is placed at 10,543.47, followed by 10,481.73. If the index starts moving upward, key resistance levels to watch out are 10,647.47 and 10,689.73.

The Nifty Bank index closed at 26,273.6. The important Pivot level, which will act as crucial support for the index, is placed at 26,094.8, followed by 25,916.0. On the upside, key resistance levels are placed at 26,389.0, followed by 26,504.4.

With May F&O expiry coming this week coupled with a mixed set of global and domestic cues, we can expect a volatile trade in the coming week, Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com, said in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Q) The Nifty50 rose marginally for the week ended May 25, 2018. It managed to close above 10,600. Do you increase volatility amid F&O expiry in the coming week?

A) Despite a strong breakdown below the crucial level of 10,500 on Wednesday, Nifty managed to recoup its early losses in the two consecutive sessions.

The index took a strong support from its 200-days EMA level. On Friday, Nifty made an intraday high-low of 10,628 and 10,524 indicating divided sentiment in the market.

Thus, with May F&O expiry coming this week coupled with a mixed set of global and domestic cues, we can expect a volatile trade in the coming week.

Further, as index managed to bounce back in the two session from a week’s low level, the index is likely to witness a profit booking regime due to lack of any positive trigger so far.

It will be advisable to continue with the specific stock selection with a positive momentum for a fresh long position and a strict trailing stop-loss.

Q) Modi govt will complete its 4 years on 26th. How do you see the journey of the last 4 years and how does the next one year of the govt likely to pan out for markets?

A) Since taking over the office on May 2014, Modi government has remained as a pro-reformist institution across the period to attract global investors in India.

The relaxation or alterations of various FDI policy and upgrade in World Bank’s ease of doing business are the accolades achieved in the last four years.

Further, landmark tax reforms with the rollout of Goods & Service Tax, and demonetization exercise on November 2016 in its effort to curb unaccounted money was a genuine step taken by Modi government to create better India.

However, given a recent upsurge in crude oil price coupled with the weakening of the Rupee, the market is likely to monitor the financial health of the nation.

With adverse effect on current account deficit and also on fiscal slippage, it is likely to put pressure on Modi government ahead of general election 2019 and thus keeping the market on the kneejerk action.

Q) Plenty of stocks hit fresh 52-week lows this week instead of 52-week high. Do you think these are stocks which are carrying the momentum and investors should ideally book profits or stay away from them?

A) The earnings growth for Q4FY18 has been lower than what was expected with the majority of companies reporting below estimated earnings. Banking segment alone reported a loss worth of about Rs 35,000 crore in Q4 on new provisioning.

Further, a valuation concern in mid and small cap companies have dented the growth trajectory in companies as it continues to report subdue earnings.

Therefore, it will be advisable to follow with fundamentally driven companies begged by earnings visibility and use the short-term dip as a buying opportunity.

However, stocks with no buying story or lacks a rationality of future growth, it will be prudent to stay away and focus on select-stocks.

Q) What is your call on smallcap and midcap stocks? Should investors stay away or just book profits on rallies?

A) The valuation concerns continue to exist in this space after a staggering upsurge witnessed in the last year which was ahead of its fundamental in most cases.

Further, a dented growth in current period along with repositioning in the portfolio is going to put pressure on small & midcap stock in coming period.

Now, with the major election nearing its deadline, this space is largely expected to witness volatile momentum. Therefore, an investor hunting to capitalise on a short-term basis should re-approach there strategy, and ideally, they should stay away.

However, a long-term investor can continue to hold quality stock from this space in a portfolio with lower allocation and use any downward swing as value buying.

Q) Top 3-5 positional call which could give handsome returns to investors in next 1 month?

ITC: Sell | Target: Rs 250 | Stop loss: Rs 285 | Return: 8%

Just Dial: Buy | Target: Rs 575 | Stop loss: Rs 480 | Return: 13%

Jain Irrigation System: Buy | Target: Rs 123 | Stop loss: Rs 94 | Return: 18%

Dolat Capital's research report on ITC

ITC’s Q4FY18 revenues came below our expectations primarily due to ~3% decline in volume growth. Nevertheless, EBITDA and APAT came in line with our estimate. A 430bps expansion in GM and EBITDA margin was a positive surprise. In addition, robust 64% jump in FMCG business was encouraging. However, revenue decline in paper and agri businesses was restricted top line growth. Going ahead, we believe that the volumes in cigarette business would continue to remain under pressure as the government expected to increase duties on the category. Nevertheless, considering the constant increase in smuggled cigarette contribution we believe that the increase in duties would remain modest. Further, ITC’s entry in new FMCG categories and impetus to accelerate growth in existing categories would increase profitability.

Outlook

Valuing ITC at a PER of 28x FY20E EPS to arrive at a TP of ` 310. Maintain Accumulate.For all recommendations report, click here

Hindustan Unilever, which hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 1,603.60 per share, surpassed cigarette-to-soap major ITC in terms of market capitalisation in intraday trade on Friday to become the fourth largest valued company on the BSE and most valued firm in the FMCG space.

HUL’s MCap stood at Rs 347,103 crore when it touched its 52-week high on Friday, whereas ITC's MCap was Rs 346,052.78 crore at around the same time.

Outperformance by HUL helped the company surpass ITC. HUL has been gaining momentum, while ITC has merely held on to the same level where it was in the last one-year.

In the last one year, HUL rallied from Rs 1,006.35 per share recorded on May 17, 2017 to Rs 1,569.25 per share seen on May 17 this year, which translates in an upside of nearly 56 percent. On the other hand, ITC slipped to Rs 279 per share on May 17 from Rs 281.85 per share recorded on May 17, 2017. This translates in a fall of little over a percent.

Most global brokerage firms maintain a strong buy on HUL post its Q4 result. They have raised their target price for the FMCG major which translates in an upside of six percent. In the case of ITC, most global brokerage firms maintain their recommendation on the stock with a 12-month target price of Rs 340 per share.

Here’s what global brokerage firms are recommending on both ITC and HUL post Q4 results:

Global brokerage firms on HUL:

CLSA: Outperform| Target raise to Rs 1,650 from Rs 1,575

CLSA maintains an outperform rating on HUL post Q4 results but raised its target price to Rs 1,650 from Rs 1,575 earlier. Hindustan Unilever's 11 percent volume growth is best in class, said the CLSA note.

The management commentary is also fairly positive, with a decisive pick-up seen in the rural growth. “The rural segment has improved but we need to wait a few more quarters to establish any trend,” added the note.

Credit Suisse: Outperform| Target raise to Rs 1,675 from Rs 1,530 earlier

Credit Suisse maintains an outperform rating on HUL post Q4 results but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 1,675 from Rs 1,530 earlier.

HUL saw a strong pick-up in volume growth trend while margins expanded despite a jump in ad spend. The volume growth is at 11 percent mark which is a significant acceleration in the trend on the base of 4 percent, said the Credit Suisse note.

The management still looks to expand operating margins in FY19 despite the expectation of a rise in inflation led by higher crude oil prices.

Morgan Stanley: Underweight| Target raise to Rs 1,260 from Rs 1,120

Morgan Stanley maintains an underweight rating on HUL Post Q4 results but raised its 12-month target to Rs 1260, from Rs 1120 earlier.

The Q4 suggests worst in terms of volume growth for the industry, but worst may well be over. The brokerage firm estimate around 9 percent volume growth in FY19. HUL stocks trade at 30 percent premium to last 12-year average price to earnings ratio.

Global Brokerage firms on ITC:

Morgan Stanley: Overweight| Target: Rs 320

Morgan Stanley maintains an overweight stance on ITC post Q4 results with a target price of Rs 320. Cigarette volumes declined 2.5 percent which was broadly in line with estimates.

The key positive from the Q4 result was the cigarette EBIT growth which stood at 7.6 percent. Overweight rating is premised on the expectation of a steady cigarette tax policy, said the report.

CLSA: BUY| Target: Rs340

CLSA maintains a buy rating on ITC post Q4 results. The Q4 was in line with our expectation although other businesses were much weaker.

The Cigarette volumes declined around 3 percent on a YoY basis, a shade worse, highlighted the CLSA report. FY18 capex was around Rs33bn while the dividend payout was at less than 70 percent.

Jefferies: BUY| Target: Rs 330

Jefferies maintains a buy rating on ITC post Q4 results with a 12-month target price of Rs 330. The Q4 revenue, EBITDA, and PAT came broadly in line with our estimates.

There was a strong improvement in FMCG segment profitability. Jefferies expects FY19 to be a recovery year for the cig. business given likely lower tax hikes, it said in a report.

ITC’s Q4 FY18 result marks another quarter of an improving trend in its non-cigarettes business, led by double-digit underlying growth in the FMCG business and improving margin profile for both FMCG and hotels businesses. While the cigarettes business is gradually stabilising with improved margins, trading multiple for the stock remains at the lower end of FMCG sector valuation range.

Operational improvement in Q4

Scale up in FMCG business

Source: Company

Q4 topline was inline with our expectations. Revenue declined around five percent year-on-year (YoY) due to moderate decline (about two percent) in cigarette volumes, weak performance in the agri and paperboard business. The same was partially offset by improvement in hotels and FMCG (Others) businesses.

Cigarette business stabilising: Q4 FY18 marks the third consecutive quarter of volume decline on account of a steep increase in tax incidence due to rollout of the Goods & Service Tax (GST). Higher price for the legal cigarettes industry has impacted industry participants across the board. VST Industries, for instance, have been witnessing moderate volume growth. Its volume decline has been narrowing on a sequential basis. Margins in this segment have also improved by 41 bps sequentially.

Read: Little known consumption names that stood out this earnings season

FMCG: Underling growth in the company’s FMCG business is about 11 percent YoY (versus 12 percent YoY in Q3 FY18). Excluding Aashirvaad atta, which was impacted by the plastic controversy on social media, FMCG sales were up 12 percent YoY. On account of operating efficiencies and better product mix, operating margin expanded 134 bps sequentially. In major categories like premium biscuits and personal care, the company enhanced its market position. ITC’s lifestyle retailing business, however, remained sluggish.

Hotels: Margins in the hotels business rose 102 bps YoY (up 483 bps quarter-on-quarter) on better room rates, operating leverage and growth in food and beverages.

Agri-business: Growth in agri-business was weak due to drought in Andhra Pradesh and adverse quality of the tobacco leaf crop there. Its paperboard business was impacted by weak demand conditions in cigarette and liquor industry. However, margins improved YoY due to soft input cost and a favourable product mix.

ITC remains a value play

While the stock has recently rebounded from its technical support level of around Rs 258 per share, it is still about 20 percent off its 52 week high. With the stock currently trading near multi-year low multiples (29 time FY19e earnings), valuations are at a steep discount to industry leader Hindustan Unilever.

In the medium-term, the company is expected to benefit from strong industry wide positive trends in its non-cigarettes businesses, particularly FMCG and hotels. In both businesses, the company is well positioned in terms of scale and offerings. Improving profitability exemplifies the same trend.

On a comparable basis, gross sales value (net of rebates/discounts) stood at Rs. 67081.92 crore, representing a growth of 4.5 percent driven mainly by the branded packaged foods, personal care and the education and stationery products businesses offset by decline in agri business revenue.

The company reported EBITDA margin of 39.1 percent compared to 38.4 percent a year ago.

The Nifty on Friday ended 0.57 percent lower at 10,618.25. Negative opening followed by retracement towards 10,600 levels led to end the session with a bearish body candle. Day’s low was 10,601.60.

A minor correction against 6 weeks of consecutive uptrend ended with a bearish shooting star candle. However, primary trend suggests it may again see aggressive buying on dips.

On the Nifty hourly chart; it ended just above the 100 EMA. Chart pattern suggests a pullback is likely. However, upside resistance around 10,700 has to be taken out towards unfolding a rise up to 10,780.

Looking at the weekly chart, ITC is in a consolidation phase since the past few months which resulted into a formation of Double Bottom pattern on the charts.

Recently, the stock saw a decent traction and in that optimism, the stock confirmed its breakout from the Double bottom pattern on daily chart on a closing basis.

On the weekly chart, the said pattern will be confirmed once it starts sustaining above Rs 291. The weekly RSI (14) entered inside the 60 levels which indicate that the stock is on the verge of a breakout.

The weekly Bollinger band has started expanding and is indicating that the volatility is likely to increase in the coming weeks. Hence, we recommend traders to buy this around Rs 283 to Rs 280 with a price target of Rs 320 and a stop loss placed below Rs 266.

The Nifty50 which reclaimed its crucial psychological resistance level of 10,600 made a bullish candle on the daily charts on Thursday. The index took support at its 5-days exponential moving average (DEMA) for the third day in a row.

However, Nifty witnessed selling pressure around its crucial resistance level of 10630-10640. Hence, for bulls to regain control of D-Street, a close above 10640 is required which would open fresh target towards 10900 in May series, suggest experts.

Option data suggests an immediate trading range in between 10500 to 10700 and traders are advised to remain on the long side. Level of 10500 will act as crucial support for the index. Investors should keep a trailing stop loss below 10,530 for long positions.

On the option front, for the May series option data scattered at various strike prices since it’s the beginning of new series. Maximum Put OI is at 10500 followed by 10400 strikes while maximum Call OI is at 11000 followed by 10800 strikes.

Since last two days, ITC has been trading above its 200 days moving average which is placed at Rs 272.20 level, moreover, the volume activity also was very appealing during this phase indicates a positive sight for the counter in coming trading sessions.

Moreover, it seems that the stock is forming a Double Bottom formation which is a bullish reversal pattern and suggests a northward direction for the counter.

After hitting an all-time high of Rs 367.70, the stock gave a healthy correction with above-average volume; however, the stock had managed to pause its further downside movement at Rs 250 level which is a 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement level of its previous up move from Rs 222 level to rs 367.70 level, which shows a bounce back movement in the counter.

On a weekly chart, the stock has confirmed an Inverted Hammer Candlestick with the support of its previous bottom which is normally considered as a classic reversal formation.

Even the stock has been continuously trading above its 200 weeks moving average since last many weeks which suggest s that the long-term trend of the stock is positive and based on the stock may accelerate its upside movement.

A weekly momentum indicator RSI reading is at 58.21 level with a positive crossover, apart from it, the RSI has a strong support of 40 marks from where it bounced back in the past as well which points out for a positive breath in the stock.

Based on the above technical structure, we are expecting an upside movement in the counter up to the level of Rs 295-312 while downside support comes at Rs 253.

The Finance Ministry may come out with a Rs 10,000-crore follow-on fund offer of the Bharat-22 exchange traded fund (ETF) as it looks to dilute stake in Coal India to meet the minimum public holding norm.

Besides, the ministry is keen to take the ETF route to sell off government shares held through SUUTI in private companies -- ITC, Axis Bank and L&T, an official told PTI.

The government had in November last year launched Bharat-22 ETF comprising shares of 22 companies, including public sector undertakings (PSUs), public sector banks, ITC, Axis Bank and L&T.

The fund had garnered bids to the tune of Rs 32,000 crore, although the government retained only Rs 14,500 crore.

An official said the ETF route is a safer mode of disinvestment as it shields investors against stock market volatility.

""Based on the current composition of the Bharat-22 ETF, the leg room for a follow-on fund offer would be around Rs 10,000 crore,"" the official added.

The state-owned companies or PSUs that are part of the new Bharat ETF-22 include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco.

The other central public sector enterprises on the list are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks -- SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda -- figure in the Bharat-22 index.

The official said by using the ETF route, the government may dilute about 3.55 per cent stake held in Coal India to comply with the minimum 25 per cent public float requirement as mandated by market regulator Sebi.

The government plans to raise Rs 80,000 crore in the current fiscal from disinvestment, lower than over Rs 1 lakh crore raised last year.

Prior to the launch of Bharat-22 ETF which has a diversified portfolio, the government had floated the CPSE ETF comprising stocks of 10 bluechip PSUs -- ONGC, Coal India, IOC, GAIL (India), Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, Engineers India and Container Corporation of India.

Through the CPSE ETF, the government had raised Rs 11,500 crore in three tranches, with Rs 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014, Rs 6,000 crore from the second tranche in January 2017 and Rs 2,500 crore from the third tranche in March 2017."

Porinju Veliyath of Equity Intelligence India said the biggest wealth creators in 2017 shed some gains extending into double-digits in the past two months. This, he said, was on the cards largely on account of high valuations.

In an interview to CNBC-TV18, he feels the worst is over for Indian markets. Though he finds markets reasonably priced, stock picking to him has become difficult.

Veliyath said most investors have moderated their return expectations from the market given the global and domestic cues. On crude, he does not see prices sustaining at higher levels.

He advises investors to look at consumption themes. ""These stocks can generate 15-20 percent CAGR in a safe way.""

ITC

Veliyath recently started buying ITC. The counter has been an underperformer, down 25-30 percent from its peak. In the past couple of decades, the stock has been trading in a PE band of 25-30 times. It is now available near the lower end of this range. Another factor which makes the stock attractive is the company's huge investments in the non-cigarette business. He feels ITC is at an inflection point and investors who want to generate reasonable 15-20 percent CAGR returns for the next five years should enter now.

Tata Global Beverage, Tata Coffee & Indian Hotels:

He continues to buy Tata Global Beverages for his clients even though it has corrected slightly. ""Tata Coffee has deep value. Indian Hotels is also looking good and is at an inflection point."" According to Veliyath, these three Tata Group companies are changing and N Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons, is doing a wonderful job. ""Chandrasekaran is focusing on factors such as profitability and growth."" He added that these three Tata Group stocks offer safety to minority shareholders.

Britannia Industries

""If somebody likes the business, one can still buy through the Bombay Burmah Trading. This offers a deep discount which over a course of time should come down,"" Veliyath said.

Va Tech Wabag

Veliyath said there are limited options for equity investors in the water business. He has taken an over five percent stake in the counter. ""Va Tech Wabag has a clean balance sheet and the way it is being managed, it could be a stock to watch in near future."" He was quick to add that investors need not hurry to buy the stock now.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday, in its first-stage forecast, predicted ‘normal’ South-West monsoons (June-September 2018) which could put a lot of agri, FMCG and auto stocks back on investors’ radar. Quantitatively, rainfall activity is likely to be 97 percent of long period average (LPA) as against 95 percent actual rainfall last year, it said. If the forecast holds true, this will be the third consecutive year of normal monsoon.

Indian companies derive a significant portion of their earnings from rural areas. A deficient/excess rainfall results in crop losses, leading to lower earnings for farmers. This in turn results in lower rural demand and sales.

Deepak Jasani, Head-Retail Research, HDFC Securities, said that while some companies directly deal in the agriculture market by providing seeds, agro-chemicals, fertilisers etc, others indirectly benefit from a robust rural economy like FMCG and auto.

“Another sector affected due to the health of the rural economy is banks, NBFCs, and micro-finance institutions. Banks, FMCG, auto account for more than 50 percent weightage in the Nifty. Any change in earnings expectations of these sectors due to the monsoon will drive performance of these stocks and of the index as a whole,” he said.

The biggest sector to be directly impacted by a normal or deficient rainfall is agriculture or the farm sector. The sector employs over 50 percent of India's workforce and contributes nearly 15 percent to GDP.

Ritesh Ashar, Chief Strategy Officer, KIFS Tarde Capital, said the agricultural sector is set for a boost if the monsoon predictions are accurate. He was also spoke of the indirect relationship between the monsoon and food inflation. ""Although they are not so directly related, a deficient rainfall should theoretically result in lower crop output and drive up prices due to a demand-supply mismatch.”

Sounding a cautionary tone, he said that though rains are necessary, what is more important is its quantum and distribution.

Here is a list of top 10 stocks which are likely to benefit the most from a normal monsoon:

Analyst: Ritesh Ashar, CSO, KIFS Trade Capital

Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals

Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals' (GSFC) Q3 net profit grew multi-fold to Rs 199.6 crore compared to Rs 61.2 crore year-ago. Revenues from operations increased 39.4 percent to Rs 1,537.5 crore from Rs 1,103 crore in the period under review. GSFC expects balance subsidy payment of Rs 700 crore in the next one to two quarters. Melamine plant capex is expected to be commissioned by September this year.

He lists positives like a book value of Rs 166 per share, trailing EPS of Rs 12 and turning debt free after Q4 FY19. The stock is trading at a low valuation and is a buy on dips. The recent budget focussed on agriculture which also added spark to the scrip. A good monsoon could usher robust volumes in Q4 and beyond.

PI Industries

New launches in the domestic market and commercialisation of three projects is likely to drive growth. Profits in Q2 were weak but new products are expected to grow and aid revenue in coming quarters.

Agrochemical companies are expected to report a 6-10 percent sales growth in Q4 FY18, but high raw material prices may put pressure on margins. We expect 15-20 percent YoY increase in revenue, although margins have reduced slightly. The company also maintains a decent order book.

The company sold a total 7,399 units in March against 6,023 units in the same period last year, a growth of 23 percent. It sold 1,808 tractors in March versus 1,398 YoY, a jump of 29.3 percent. Power tiller volumes were up 21 percent at 5,591 units as compared to 4,625 units in March 2017. The company has started commercial production at its new power tiller plant at Malur, Karnataka which will add to revenue.

Havells India

The company has been continuously growing in each business parameter and is expected to directly benefit from the government's 'housing and power for all' initiative. It is best placed to attain scale across businesses, with its new SBU (Strategic Business Unit) structure and focused product-wise branding strategy. It has pioneered the concept of an exclusive brand showroom in the electrical industry with ‘Havells Galaxy’. It became the first fast moving electrical goods company to offer doorstep service via its initiative ‘Havells Connect’.

Manappuram Finance

The company is witnessing healthy financial growth across all business segments. Its diversification efforts paid off as overall growth is well supported by robust growth witnessed in new businesses. The management expects to maintain the strong growth momentum in all three new business segments, including rural India as well as the gold loan segment. Strong growth in the rural economy usually results in expansion of credit and also facilitates consistency of repayments.

Swaraj Engines

The management expects positive demand growth for tractors and higher market share due to the government’s continued thrust on the agri and rural sector. The central government has time and again reiterated its aim to double farm income by 2022 through better productivity and enhanced farm realisations. SEL is a leading supplier of tractor engines to market leader Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M). The company is one of the key players to benefit from this transition.

CLSA is of the view that a normal monsoon is likely to aid rural recovery. The global investment bank expects rural wage growth to pick up. It lists ITC, Emami, M&M, Godrej Consumer and Ramco Cements as key beneficiaries of a normal monsoon.

ITC

Credit Suisse maintains a neutral stance on ITC with a target price of Rs 320 per share. It said that the Union Budget is still relevant for the company post the implementation of the Goods & Services Tax. The brokerage said the risk-reward is favourable at the margin, with valuations attractive relative to peers.

M&M

CLSA has maintained its Buy call on M&M and raised its target price to Rs 960 per share from Rs 910 earlier. Its rural demand outlook improved with the normal monsoon forecast. A likely hike in government support prices for agri commodities is a positive for the stock. Launch of the new MPV should also boost utility vehicle segment volumes.

Excel IndustriesFirstcall Research maintains an Overweight rating on Excel Industries with a target price of Rs 874 per share. The company is an India-based chemical manufacturer. It operates through four divisions that include chemicals, veterinary, environ-biotech and pharma. Excel is also a leading supplier of specialty intermediaries to agrochemical producers.

UPL and Rallis India

A robust monsoon and expected hikes in the minimum support rates are likely to usher improved expectations for farm income. Higher acreage and yield on the back of improved farmer sentiments coupled with a recovery in farm income are likely to bolster agrochemicals business growth in FY19. Elara Capital is bullish on UPL and Rallis India in the agrochemical space.

Sumit Bilgaiyan Founder of Equity99

ITC has been a steady compounder for the last thirty years. We expect the company’s performance to improve with steady rise in revenues and improvement in margins due to GST. Higher taxation will put a stress on cigarette volumes but that being a business with inelastic demand, is expected to bounce back in the long term.

With per capita consumption 1/18th China’s, cigarette opportunity in India remains attractive over the long term. However, with cigarette still contributing 85 percent to ITC’s EBIT, reliance on regulated business continues to remain high.

Currently the stock trades at 26X FY19 PE. We recommend a BUY on the stock with target price of Rs 310.

FMCG major ITC today said it would file an FIR in the national capital, the third in the country, against circulation of videos which claimed presence of plastic in its 'Aashirvaad Atta'.

The company has already filed FIRs in Kolkata and Hyderabad.

""We are now in the process to file another FIR in Delhi in coming few days,"" ITC Divisional Chief Executive (Foods) Hemant Malik told PTI here.

Though the matter is under investigation by cyber cells of police in the respective states, some new names have cropped up, necessitating another complaint in the case, he added.

Malik said the first video claiming presence of plastic appeared in July 2017 and was telecast on a local TV channel in Siliguri, West Bengal.

""We immediately contacted the channel and they withdrew it. Later, some more channels played it in some other parts of the country. Then we moved the City Civil Court in Bengaluru, restraining anyone from circulating any such videos,"" he added.

Claiming that 'Aashirvaad Atta' is fully safe for consumption, Malik said what was being called plastic was in reality wheat protein that is an integral component of wheat.

""Even FSSAI mandates that wheat flour should contain a minimum of six per cent gluten, which is wheat protein, on a dry weight basis. Indian wheat typically has 9-10 per cent gluten. We urge our consumers not to be misled by false and malicious videos,"" he added.

Malik said the latest round of fake videos are being circulated in social media from February this year and it has affected ITC as well as other organised players' sale of atta brands."

Cigarette and FMCG major ITC said that it has to bear an incremental tax burden of over 20 percent due to the combined impact of increase in excise duty in Budget 2017 and revision in GST compensation cess on cigarettes.

Moneycontrol takes a look a what top research house from across the globe thinks about the outlook on the stock

Brokerage: Jefferies | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 320

Jefferies has maintained a buy on ITC and has raised the target price to Rs 320 from Rs 302. The house feels that Q3FY18 results was a mixed bag adding that cigarettes and volumes were soft with resilient margins. However, it is of the view that FMCG showed strong all-round show.

Other businesses and hotels has taken the lead and expects gradual recovery in ITC cigarette volumes with better recovery in other businesses led by other FMCG.

Brokerage: Deutsche Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 350

Resarch firm Deutsche Bank has also maintained a buy and has raised the target to Rs 350 from Rs 325. It is of the view that results in Q3FY18 was in-line with estimates.

The firm feels that cigarette volume declined 4 percent YoY, but was flat QoQ. ITC's FMCG division reported healthy sales growth of 16 percent with high probability of rational tax increase in February 2018 which is a potential re-rating event, it added.

Brokerage: Macquarie | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 304

Macquarie has maintained a neutral rating on the stock with a target of Rs 304 per share and has cut estimates by 2 percent on account of lower realisation, adding that cigarette volume is likely to remain under pressure.

However, the research firm is of the view that there is limited downside for the stock with valuation support at current level. Any re-rating will depend on the government's decision of FY19 cess, it said.

Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 320

Global research house Credit Suisse has maintained a neutral rating on ITC and has raised the target to Rs 320 from Rs 310 per scrip. The firm is of the view that Budget 2018 holds the key for the stock and feels that tax hike needs to be below 10 percent for the stock to get re-rated.

Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on ITC

ITC reported 5% cigarette volume decline and 7% EBIT growth on QoQ improvement in cigarette demand. We expect a slow recovery given ~15-20% increase in cigarette prices in the current year. FMCG business led by processed foods has shown sharp improvement in profitability, we expect sustained improvement in margins given scaled up business in segments like Biscuits, Atta, Noodles and even as Personal care and Lifestyle will remain a near term drag. Paperboard business is expected to improve margins given benign input costs and benefits of imported pulp substitution even as volumes will remained impacted in cigarette paper business. We expect higher ARR and occupancy rates to improve profitability in Hotels. Lower production and high prices of leaf tobacco in India and soft demand globally will drag Agri business in near term. ITC trades at 23.6xFY20 EPS which is at 30-35% discount to our coverage universe, which limits downside in the stock.

Outlook

Retain “Buy” with target price of Rs333. Steep increase in cigarette taxes are a key risk to our call.

ITC’s third quarter headline numbers were tad below consensus but segments like FMCG and hotels performed on expected lines. With uncertainty over GST rates for cigarettes over, budget announcements focused on the rural economy could be the next trigger for ITC’s other lines of business.

Q3 results: improved margins

While topline numbers were slightly below expectations, adjusted net profit was close to expectations. Net profit, if adjusted for exceptional item concerning Tamil Nadu entry tax, amounted to around Rs 2800 crore, up 7% quarter-on-quarter. This was possible due to better margins. EBITDA margin was about 40% vs. 38.3% in Q3 2017.

Segmental business: FMCG scaling up

As expected, cigarette business was impacted by lower volumes. Sales in the hotel business rose 9% year-on-year and operating profit was up 30%, in-line with sector wide trend. FMCG business topline numbers were up about 12 percent YoY. Its operating profit doubled sequentially, underlining the improving trend.

Budget is the next trigger

ITC remains a value play. Its P/E multiple is at multi-year low compared to industry leader and sector average. Stock currently trading around 32 times trailing earnings vs 58 times for HUL.

There FMCG business is showing improving results in terms of profitability and remains well positioned to benefit from vertical integration and investment in supply chain. Further, on the key cash flow business, cigarettes, worst of tax related headwinds seems over.

With Budget is around the corner, in the year of state elections, announcements pertaining to improving farm income, food processing industry, investment on rural infrastructure could be positive for the stock.

ITC today said it has to bear an incremental tax burden of over 20 percent due to the combined impact of increase in excise duty in budget 2017 and revision in GST compensation cess on cigarettes.

The cumulative growth in tax incidence on cigarettes, after cognising for the latest increase in cess rates, stands at 202 percent in last six years, ITC said in its earnings release.

""The combined impact of increase in excise duty announced by the Union Budget 2017 and the revision in GST compensation cess resulted in an incremental tax burden of over 20 percent on the company,"" it added.

ITC said cigarette volumes remained under ""severe pressure"" due to ""sharp increase in tax incidence and intense regulatory pressures"".

The sharp upward revision in GST compensation cess announced by the GST Council at its meeting on July 17, 2017 ""exacerbated the situation"", ITC said.

After the implementation of GST on July 1, the government on July 17 had hiked the limit of cess to be levied on cigarettes as it felt that the industry was reaping a windfall gain as the tax rate was lower than what it was in the pre-GST era.

On top of the 28 percent tax, the GST Council, comprising Centre and states, hiked the compensation cess levied on cigarettes.

The government while hiking the cess rate had said it was being done to ensure that tax rates in pre and post GST era remains the same.

""....the upward revision resulted in significantly higher tax incidence on cigarettes compared to the pre GST scenario which is not in keeping with the fundamental principle of revenue neutrality,"" ITC said.

The move has also affected the legal cigarette industry volumes, which had remained under severe pressure due to high in tax incidence and regulatory pressures, it added.

""It is apprehended that the sharp increase in tax incidence as aforestated will severely undermine the legal cigarette industry and adversely impact tobacco farmers,"" it added.

The company today reported 16.75 percent increase in standalone net profit at Rs 3,090.20 crore for the December quarter.

Revenue from cigarettes, however, stood at Rs 4,629.19 crore. It was Rs 8,287.97 crore in the year ago period."

Edelweiss' research report on ITC

Predicting budget outcomes is, more often than not, a futile exercise, generally leading to more misses than hits. Yet, we see higher probability (70%) to Budget 2018 being kinder to ITC as: (i) government’s monthly compensation cess collection (>INR75bn run rate) over July-November 2017, if extrapolated for full year, indicates healthy ~INR675bn kitty versus INR500bn estimate; (ii) government is sharpening focus on tax collection from other tobacco products (including illegal cigarettes); and (iii) historical trend indicates a soft-to-moderate budget post a harsh budget in the preceding year (though FY17 budget was moderate, GST rate was harsh resulting in ~16-17% tax hike in a year). Improving prospects of ITC’s other businesses and the P/E gap between HUL & ITC (at ~50%, multi year) lend valuation comfort. Hence, though we maintain ‘HOLD’, at CMP, risk- reward looks favourable.

Outlook

With per capita consumption 1/18th of China’s, cigarette opportunity in India remains attractive over the long term. However, with cigarette still contributing ~85% to EBIT, reliance on regulated business continues to remain high. Hence, we maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ and value ITC on SOTP on FY20E to arrive at TP of INR307. At CMP, stock is trading at 25.9x FY19E EPS.

HDFC Securities' research report on ITC

With fiscal stress on the rise, many investors are worried on the likelihood of govt. increasing taxes on cigarettes in the upcoming Union Budget. We think this fear is exaggerated. Cigarette taxes contribute only ~2% of total tax collection: Cigarette industry contributed ~Rs 284bn to the exchequer in FY17 (ITC contribution ~75%). The total tax collection (direct and indirect) for India was at Rs 17,032bn in FY17 out of which Rs 8,562bn was from indirect taxes. Therefore, cigarette industry contributed ~3% to the indirect taxes and ~2% to the total taxes, not very significant.

Diversified conglomerate ITC expects chocolate category to contribute 10 percent to its food division revenue in next five years, a top company official said. The company had entered into chocolate category with brand Fabelle in May last year.

""In five years, we should see a 10 percent share of the total food business from chocolates,"" ITC Foods Divisional Chief Executive Hemant Malik said. The company's branded packaged food business, which spans categories like staples, spices, ready-to-eat, snack foods, bakery and confectionery, among others, reportedly clocked sales of over Rs 8,000 crore last fiscal.

The chocolate industry in the country is pegged at Rs 8,000 crore and ITC is now looking at the mass premium space.

""We will phase ourselves. There is no point in launching too many products. We will be looking at various spaces and be a full portfolio player (in chocolate category)...Overall market share in five years, we should have 15-20 percent,"" Malik said.

The company manufactures chocolates from its Bengaluru facility at present and it has added another factory at Haridwar. ""We have a factory in Bengaluru and we have also set-up a factory in Haridwar, which will help us enter into the mass range. We want to bring something new and differentiated to the market. We are developing new products and testing our products. Once we feel we are ready, we will come to the market,"" he said.

On the revised GST rates for chocolates from a tax slab of 28 percent to 18 percent, he said, ""we have corrected our prices accordingly. Once that happens, it becomes more accessible to the consumers and hopefully the market will increase"".

ITC launched its luxury chocolate brand Fabelle at boutique stores in it hotels, which also serve as experience centres, and plans to expand its reach in the retail format.

""We launched Fabelle one and half years back in the chocolate luxury space. We have seven boutiques that we have launched in our hotels. We are trying to take it outside (our hotels) and we are taking it to malls,"" he said.

The company has opened an outlet in Kolkata for its boxed chocolates and is opening a larger outlet in Delhi where people can buy boxed chocolates and also see the desserts, he said, adding that the company could also look at retailing boxed chocolates at airports.

The tobacco-to-hotels firm, which is focusing more on its non-tobacco businesses, aims to be an Rs 1 lakh crore company in the FMCG space by 2030, with the packaged foods contributing Rs 65,000 crore.

It also plans to enter coffee category soon, and Malik said the company is evaluating opportunities in health and nutrition space for its existing categories.

""We have already forayed into the health and wellness segment with some very niche and innovative products. We are formulating products which will have health benefits. While indulgence will play a large part in the food market, the nascent health segment is expected to grow and we will make a significant play in this area,"" he said."

Diversified conglomerate ITC Ltd today said its ""biggest headroom"" for growth is in the fast moving consumer goods business, where it can leverage internal capabilities.

The soap-to-cigarette maker would explore newer areas progressively, similar to what it did with the recent foray in fruits, fruit juices, vegetables and dairy products.

""It is a continuous expansion of our portfolio, which we will strive to do,"" CEO Sanjiv Puri told reporters on the sidelines of the Horasis Asia meet here.

""We believe the biggest headroom to grow is in the fast moving consumer goods business. That's where opportunities are the biggest and that's where our internal capabilities can be leveraged,"" he said.

He said ITC had recently announced an investment of Rs 10,000 crore in food processing, and another Rs 25,000 crore was under progress in various areas.

Regarding the impact of GST, Puri said by and large, trade has normalised.

There may, however, be some minor issues in the wholesale channel, he added."

Axis Direct's research report on ITC

Comparable cigarette gross sales and EBIT grew 1% and 2% with 6% volume decline. Cigarette volume was hurt due to GST rate pass-through.

PAT grew 4%, and 6% vs. consensus expectation of 6% each.

Outlook

We cut our EPS estimate for FY18/FY19 by 2-4% to factor in H1FY18 performance. We now expect 2% volume decline in FY18. Over FY17-19E, we expect sales and EPS CAGR of 9% each. Valuation at FY19E P/E of 27x is not cheap but remains significantly cheap on a relative basis.

Sharekhan's research report on ITC

Revenue and PAT grew in low single digits: For Q2FY2018, ITC reported 3.9% and 6.8% growth in its gross revenue and net revenue (on comparable basis), respectively, driven by double-digit revenue growth in non-cigarette FMCG and paperboard. Gross margin declined by 423BPS to 57.8% and OPM declined by 111BPS YoY to 36.5%. Operating profit grew by 3.6% YoY to Rs.3,761.5 crore. Higher other income and lower incidence of tax led to 5.6% YoY growth in reported PAT to Rs.2,639.8 crore (ahead of our expectation of Rs.2,537.4 crore).

Outlook

We have revised downwards our earnings estimates for FY2018 by 4% to factor in low single-digit decline in cigarette sales volumes and lower growth in the agri business. We have broadly maintained our earnings estimates for FY2019. The stock is currently trading at 24x its FY2019E earnings. In view of sustained pressure on cigarette business, we maintain our Hold recommendation on the stock with unchanged price target of Rs.325.

HDFC Securities' research report on ITC

ITC net revenues were up 1% YoY at Rs 97.6bn. Like-to-like revenue grew 4% vs. 6% expectation. EBITDA and PAT grew 4% and 6% respectively. Amidst a rise in taxes, cigarette revenue growth was at ~2%, impacted by ~6% volume contraction (5% fall anticipated). The hike in Cigarette prices was ~11%, but an unfavourable product mix (higher share of <65mm Cigarettes) impacted Cigarette revenue growth. Volume pressure was softer in September, and could result in better volume traction in the coming quarters. FMCG at 10% revenue growth (like-to-like) and Paper at 18% EBIT growth were outliers in the Non-cigarette segment. Cigarette business, despite punitive taxes, registered ~10% and ~9% revenue CAGR in the last 10 and 5 years resp. We expect ITC to deliver ~7% CAGR in the Cigarette business over FY17-20E. Non-cigarette business can improve gradually, as most of their demand drivers are in a recovery stage. We expect ~13% sales CAGR over FY17-20E.

Outlook

ITC is a market leader in Cigarettes (~70% market share), notebooks, valued-added paperboards and a critical player in biscuits. The company operates at EBITDA margin of 36%, along with core RoCE of ~40%. We have BUY rating with a TP of Rs 358, based on 32x Sep-19EPS.

Kolkata-based FMCG firm ITC, as part of its efforts to diversify into new areas of agri business, has launched a new brand ""Farmland"" to mark its foray into the fresh fruits and vegetables segment.

The company today launched four variants of potatoes and would introduce apple by the next quarter under Farmland brand.

""We are introducing potatoes in Delhi. It would be available in seven metros in the next 12 months,"" S Sivakumar, ITC Group Head Agri Business and IT.

Besides, the company is also working with farmers to produce climate-controlled farm products mainly the leafy vegetable as it aims to introduce one new product in every quarter.

On the introduction of new products, he said, ""You would see dehydrated onions in some time and some other dehydrated vegetables (and) fruits, it will take little bit more time.""

There would be one new product every quarter, Sivakumar said adding that the company has plans to bring fresh apples and dehydrated onions.

He, however, clarified that dehydrated products would not come under the 'Farmland' brand.

""Not Farmland for sure, we might use any existing brand, which is for processed. Farmland is essentially for fresh and processed would be a different brand,"" he said.

The Indian fresh fruit and vegetable market is estimated to be around Rs 5 lakh crore, and of that potato is around Rs 70,000 crore.

The company has introduced potatoes in four variants as - natural low sugar potatoes, potatoes with antioxidant, baby potatoes and French fry potatoes.

The company is tapping its traditional FMCG channel to tap the neighbouring stores, modern format trade channels and online channels.

The company is also expanding its ITC Masterchef brand by adding more metro cities in its network.

Edelweiss' research report on ITC

Cigarette volumes declined 6% YoY on a base of 3% growth. This was expected considering the hike in effective tax rate in GST regime. In order to offset higher GST rate, ITC has hiked prices 10-11% YoY. While volumes were comparatively better for 64mm portfolio (contributes 38% to overall sales), premium portfolio is facing some stress. Underlying sales of the FMCG segment jumped 10% YoY with profitability improvement driven by enhanced scale, improved realisation and mix enrichment.

Outlook

With per capita consumption 1/18th China’s, the cigarette opportunity in India remains attractive over the long term. However, the high GST rate will pressurise volumes due to resultant price hikes. We maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ and value ITC on SOTP on FY19E to arrive at target price of INR 307. The stock is currently trading at 25.8x FY19E EPS.

ITC Ltd posted its Q2FY18 results which were below our estimates, Net revenue for Q2FY18 reported at INR 97,639.2 Mn which de-grew by 28.3% YoY and by 29.2% QoQ. Mainly due Adverse Impact of GST which led to lower revenue from Cigarettes Segment. During H1FY18, ITC posted net revenue of INR 235,643.4 Mn which declined by 12.3% YoY.

Outlook

ITC is an old conglomerated company with its presence across diversify businesses like Cigarettes, FMCG, Hotels, Agri and Paper & Paper products. During Q2FY18, GST has impacted its overall businesses, we believe that cigarettes business would remain under pressure due to high taxation while focus is to grow FMCG and other business which would see growth and improvement in future. However management focus is to diversify its business into FMCG from cigarettes by entering new segment with innovative products. ITC aims to generate around 25-30% revenue from FMCG in next 3-4 years. We believe ITC has created brand image with its strong product portfolio and would post its revenue growth of around 10-12% in FY18E & FY19E with growth driven mainly by its FMCG and other businesses. Its EBIDTA and PAT margins will be stable at around 26.8% and 18.2%, respectively.

Mutual funds houses have been lapping up shares of ITC due to its cheap valuations compared with the available stocks in the FMCG sector.

India’s 4th largest company by market cap which rose a little over 11 percent so far in the year 2017 saw some bulk-buying interest from mutual fund managers in September ahead of its results.

Fund managers bought Rs 1,433 crore worth of ITC shares in September, according to data compiled by Morningstar India which led to over 10 percent month-on-month increase in their holding. The market value of total mutual fund holding in ITC is nearly Rs 15000 crore.

As per the data on Moneycontrol, the top 10 mutual funds, by assets under management, purchased 4.15 crore shares of ITC in September.

In the last 3 months, shares of ITC have fallen over 8 percent on fear that sales volumes of India's largest cigarette maker would be hit due to a rise in product prices after the revision in total tax incidence on cigarettes.

ITC reported Q2 sales of Rs 4,554.21 crore from its flagship cigarette business. The numbers in the quarter under question aren't comparable with the year-ago figures due to introduction of GST.

Consequent to the introduction of GST with effect from July central excise, VAT etc. have been replaced by GST. In accordance with Indian Accounting Standard - 18 on revenues and Schedule III of the companies Act, 2013, GST, GST compensation cess, VAT etc. are not included in gross revenue from sale of products and services for applicable periods.

ITC valuation has become more attractive as it became stock cheaper than its peers, say analysts.

Among the fund houses that added ITC in the recent share price correction is Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund.

September saw the highest rise in equity flows for mutual fund schemes although the total asset under management (AUM) slipped slightly.

The total category wise AUM of the mutual fund industry decreased by 0.9 percent to Rs 20.40 lakh crore in September 2017. On a QoQ basis total AUM of mutual fund increased by 2.2 percent and on a YoY basis, it increased by 29 percent.

ITC's quarterly result was in line with expectations. While the cigarettes business was adversely impacted by GST flipflops, improving topline growth and margins for the FMCG business was comforting.

Quarterly update

ITC reported a Q2 2018 sales of Rs 16,391 crore (on a like-to-like comparison) after excluding rebates and discounts translating to year-on-year (YoY) growth of 3.9 percent. Headline numbers were in line with expectations. Cost of goods sold was higher by 19 percent, mainly due to change in inventories, which impacted EBITDA margins by 142 bps on reported basis. At net profit level, company reported 5.6 percent YoY growth

Cigarette business impacted

Company reported lower volumes on account of increase in tax incidence in the GST regime. ITC’s business was also impacted due to non-availability of additional duty surcharge credit on the transition stocks.

FMCG business – Up 10 percent

ITC’s core FMCG business posted a comparable sales growth of 10 percent which is broadly in line with the industry reported growth so far. As per management, this growth was aided by strong performance in Branded Packaged foods and Personal care businesses. It’s noteworthy that closest peer HUL also reported a decent 8 percent YoY growth for the Personal care division wherein it reported good traction for all categories except for oral care segment.

Among product lines, which garnered traction were Aashirvaad atta, Bingo range of snacks and B Natural juices. Further, among Personal Care products, ‘Engage On’ range of products witnessed good customer response.

Other businesses

Performance of other segments of businesses were subdued. Hotels was impacted by highway liquor ban, Agribusiness was lackluster due to shortage of tobacco leaf crop (drought in Andhra Pradesh in 2016) and Paperboard business remained weak due to subdued demand in Cigarette industry.

Retail offtake normalized

With respect to trade channel, company mentioned that wholesale channel is yet to fully recover but offtake in the retail channel has normalized towards the end of quarter.

Overall, ITC result was on expected lines, adverse impact on cigarette volumes was more than compensated by pick up in FMCG business. Improving offtake in the FMCG business and the traction of product portfolio is comforting, which adds to our positive view on the stock.

Car maker Maruti Suzuki India share price touched a fresh record high of Rs 8,209 on Friday, rising 1.6 percent intraday and cigarette major ITC rallied nearly 3 percent ahead of earnings for the quarter ended September 2017.

For ITC that has major market share in cigarette segment, it is an important quarter to watch out for after the GST implementation with effect from July 1.

The GST Committee had set the tax rate lower for cigarette business but then revised higher to pre-GST levels. Hence, the stock had seen roller coaster ride, hitting a life high of Rs 353 on July 3 and then falling 13 percent on July 18. It fell 16.2 percent during the quarter.

Analysts expect cigarette volumes to decline 4-5 percent (against 1 percent growth in Q1FY18 and 4 percent in Q2FY17) and realisation growth at around 11-12 percent for the quarter ended September 2017.

Profit after tax is expected to increase 6.1 percent year-on-year to Rs 2,652 crore and revenue may rise 6.7 percent to Rs 14,525 crore, according to average of estimates of analysts polled by CNBC-TV18.

Revenue should be closely watched as it may differ due to GST accounting. Excise duty has been removed after GST rollout.

Meanwhile, automobile major Maruti Suzuki is likely to post lower profit at Rs 2,217.5 crore in July-September quarter against Rs 2,398 crore in same quarter last fiscal, according to a CNBC-TV18 poll. Higher tax outgo and lower other income are likely to impact profits.

The company’s net sales, however, are likely to be up 23.4 percent at Rs 22,014.1 crore against Rs 17,842.8 crore. On an operating level, the EBITDA is likely to be higher by 6 percent at Rs 3,216 crore, while the margin is seen at 14.6 percent against 17 percent YoY.

Among the key things to watch are operating margins, which could be impacted by lower gross margins due to rise in commodity prices. In fact, the ramp ups of Gujarat plans could also impact the margins, along with higher offers due to GST and festive season.

At 13:12 hours IST, Maruti Suzuki India was quoting at Rs 8,190.95, up 1.42 percent and ITC was up 2.35 percent at Rs 274.80 on the BSE."

Axis Direct's research report on ITC

According to media reports, the Health ministry has issued a directive that shops authorized to sell tobacco products will not be permitted to sell any non-tobacco products that are essentially meant for non-tobacco users, especially children. The Ministry has asked state governments to develop a mechanism through the municipal authority to provide “permission/authorization” to retail outlets selling tobacco products. While the directive is in line with various COTPA rules, implementation of such laws remains challenging.

Outlook

Post GST-related price hike in July, we expect mid-single digit volume decline in Q2FY18. The stock has corrected 22% since rate hike in July and valuation at FY19E P/E of 25x seems significantly cheap. Maintain BUY with TP of Rs 330 based on forward P/E of 30x.

Bonanza's research report on ITC

Recently, the stock price of ITC Limited (ITC) corrected by ~30% from 52- week high of Rs.368 as the company has to incur additional tax burden of 20-22% in FY18E post GST implementation. Being the leader in the Indian cigarette industry with ~75% market share, ITC commands pricing power in the segment. However, it has been witnessing moderation in volume growth since FY14. The strain on volumes was largely led by incessant price hikes taken to pass on increasing excise duty. The cumulative growth in tax incidence on cigarettes, after considering the latest increase in cess rates, stands at a staggering 202% during last 6 years, hurting the volume growth for the company as every hike is passed on by way of gradual price hikes. The legal cigarette industry’s volume has declined by ~25% since 2012-13 due to huge tax burden on account of the continuous increase in excise duties. In order to push volumes amid hikes, as a strategy, cigarette companies forayed into the 64 mm segment to vary their sales mix. ITC has also extended its existing brands, Scissors, Bristol and Capstan in the 64 mm segment at Rs.5/stick to revive its volume growth and target downtrading consumers.

Outlook

ITC plans to stimulate the distribution strategy for the FMCG business by increasing direct reach to one lakh villages in India. These one lakh villages account for ~80% of rural consumption. This shows ITC’s aggressive approach towards growing its FMCG business (19.1% of FY17 revenues). ITC’s growth from the segment has been phenomenal at ~17% CAGR in FY08-17. With the FMCG sector witnessing a continuous slowdown in volumes (ITC’s volume growth dipped from 16-18% in FY12 to 5-7% in FY17), this initiative would be a shot in the arm for ITC. Further, we believe that with continuous regulatory pressure, aggressive price hikes in cigarettes, ITC would be far more aggressive to grow its FMCG business.

Aditya AgarwalWay2Wealth Brokers Pvt. Ltd

Last week, the price action was in line with expectation as we have highlighted in our previous week's write up regarding the importance of 9700-9675 zone. The bulls respected that level by rallying sharply towards 9,950 level.

During the week, the level of 9,950 coincided with the previous support level which was broken its previous week fall hence the said level reversed its role and acted as an immediate hurdle.

The weekly relative strength index, RSI (14) momentum indicator indicates an oversold condition compare to its previous weekly fall. Also, the Higher Top Higher Bottom formation on the weekly chart is still positive.

Hence, we believe that 9700-9675 zone continue to act as a strong support and only a decisive closing below this level will trigger fresh sell-off.

Profit booking from higher levels was quite evident in Monday’s session. Broader indices opened on a positive note on the back of buying in private banking sector but Nifty failed to sustain above 9,880 levels.

In the second half of trade, sharp sell-off was seen across the board and particularly in pharma, PSU banking, capital goods and infrastructure sector that dragged Nifty below 9,800 levels and it closed at its day’s low level of 9,750.

Option data also indicates towards the rangebound movement for coming sessions. Call writing at 10,000 strike option will act as stiff supply zone for nifty in short-term whereas put writing at 9700 will prove as support for Nifty.

However, if Nifty breaches 9700 and sustains below that then in that case index is likely to correct towards 9,600-9,560 which coincided with the daily 89-EMA and even possibility of testing the strong support of 9,500 can’t be ruled out.

On the other side, 9,950 will act as an immediate hurdle and any move above this level will attract fresh buying interest that can drive Nifty towards 10,025-10,138 levels respectively.

Here is a list of top 4 trading stocks which can give up to 24% return in short-term:

ITC: Buy around 282 to 277| Target Rs320| Stop loss 265 (Timeframe 15 to 20 trading sessions)| Return 14%

ITC has been in an uptrend since late December 2016 and registered an all-time high of around 355 during early July 2017.Subsequently, we saw almost a vertical decline in stock which was followed by gradual correction towards 270.

The level 270 coincided with the multiple support zone first, the 61.8% retracement of its entire move from the bottom of 219 to 355 comes near 270, secondly, the previous multiple daily swing lows are placed near 270 and also 200-SMA is placed near 270.

Looking at the weekly chart, the RSI (14) momentum indicator has precisely tested the Rising Trend line drawn from the bottom of June 12, 2015, and started rallying northward.

Considering the above evidence, we expect this stock resume its uptrend hence we advocate traders to buy this stock in a range of 282 to 277 with a price target of 320 and stop loss placed below 265.

Concor: Buy around 1220|Target Rs1420/1520| Stop Loss Rs1110| Timeframe 1-2 months| Return 24%

Looking at the weekly chart, the stock has confirmed its breakout from a Descending Triangle pattern in early April 2017. This triggered an acceleration of bullish momentum. In that optimism, the stock rallied and hit a fresh 52-week high of 1250.

Subsequently, a bit of profit booking was seen which we term as a price wise as well as the time-wise correction. After several weeks of consolidation, stock resumed its uptrend during last week.

Weekly 9-45 EMA is still positive and is indicating that the current trend is still bullish. The daily RSI (14) entered inside the 60 level which is a bullish indication.

Hence, we are recommending traders to buy this stock in a range of 1200-1220 with a price target of 1420/1520 and Stop loss placed below 1110.

Piramal Enterprises: Sell around Rs2650| Target Rs2440| Stop Loss Rs2730| Timeframe 7 to 10 trading session| Return 6%

Last week, the stock broke the rising trend line and corrected towards the daily 89-EMA placed near 2665. Looking at the daily chart, the 9 periods EMA has signaled negative crossover and 45-EMA indicate the shift in a trend.

Also, the daily RSI (14) breached the 40 levels which is a bearish signal. Hence, we recommend traders to go short around 2650 with a price target of 2440. Stop loss should be placed above 2730.

Tata Communication: Sell at current market price at Rs629| Target 570| Stop Loss 661| Timeframe 10 to 12 trading session| Return 10%

Looking at the weekly chart, the stock has confirmed its breakdown from Double Top pattern during the early August 2017 by breaching its neckline pegged near 620. This triggered fresh sell-off in stock as a result stock slide sharply towards 570 level.

The level of 570 coincided with the weekly 89-EMA which acted as a sheet anchor and we saw a decent pullback in last week.

At this juncture, daily chart has signal Negative Reversal which is a bearish pattern. Also, due to breakdown from the double top pattern, the weekly chart has formed a Lower Top Lower Bottom formation.

Considering the above evidence, we recommend traders to go short in this counter at the current level of 629 with a price target of 570. A strict stop loss should be placed above 661.

The Indian government has threatened Philip Morris International Inc with ""punitive action"" over the tobacco giant's alleged violation of the country's anti-smoking laws, according to a letter sent to the company by the health ministry.

The letter was prompted by a Reuters investigation last month that revealed how Philip Morris was deploying marketing tactics in India, some targeting young people, that officials said were illegal.

The letter cites the Reuters story in the opening paragraph, listing Philip Morris' marketing methods as outlined in the article, including cigarette advertisements at kiosks, the free distribution of Marlboro smokes at nightclubs and bars, and the use of TV screens to promote the world's best-selling cigarette brand at these events.

These promotional activities are a violation of the country's tobacco control law and are subject to punishment under the act, says the letter, dated Aug. 10.

""You are requested to clarify your position and to show cause why appropriate punitive action be not initiated against the company and its directors,"" the letter continues.

Such infractions can carry a fine of up to 1,000 rupees (about $15) and a sentence of up to two years in prison for the first conviction, according to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act.

The India unit of Philip Morris International did not respond to questions from Reuters.

The health ministry also sent a letter to ITC Ltd , India's leading cigarette maker, which Reuters also reported last month was using some of the same promotional methods as Philip Morris, such as point of sale displays. In its letter to ITC, the health ministry said the company's advertisements at kiosks were illegal.

""Advertisement other than listing type of tobacco products available, whether displayed inside or outside the shop is prohibited and attracts punishment,"" the ministry said. It also called on ITC to explain why ""punitive action"" should not be taken against the company.

ITC did not respond to questions.

TARGETING YOUNG INDIANS

Indian officials have repeatedly said that tobacco advertisements that use brand names, pack images or promotional messages are banned at kiosks - inside and outside. Philip Morris and ITC have said they are in compliance with tobacco control regulations and that the law allows advertising inside a kiosk.

Philip Morris' marketing strategy for India is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. A key goal, according to the documents, is ""winning the hearts and minds of LA-24"" “people between legal age, 18, and 24. The documents can be viewed in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files, published by Reuters.

The tobacco shop displays and the distribution of cigarettes at events attended by young people have helped to more than quadruple Marlboro's market share in India, where Philip Morris is battling to win ground from ITC, which dominates the industry.

India, with a population of 1.3 billion, has about 100 million smokers. Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year, according to government data.

Since October last year, the state government in India's capital New Delhi has sent at least four letters to Philip Morris and at least three to ITC telling them to remove their advertisements at kiosks. Indian officials say tobacco companies get away with violations of anti-smoking regulations because law enforcement is weak.

The health ministry also instructed state governments this month to move against cigarette advertising at kiosks, as well as the distribution of free cigarettes. The ministry requested that states submit a progress report on their actions.

Following the Reuters story, Delhi state tobacco control chief S. K. Arora said he quizzed Philip Morris about the distribution of free cigarettes. In internal documents, Philip Morris calls distribution of free cigarettes ""sampling"" and says it is allowed under the law in India. The company has spent millions of dollars promoting its Marlboro brand at social events, the documents show.

At several parties attended by Reuters reporters in Delhi over the past year, young women dressed in the colors of the latest Marlboro variant handed out free packs of cigarettes after asking people for their name, age and preferred brand.

In recent weeks, Arora said he had detected a decline in the number of cigarette ads at kiosks in Delhi. Since the Reuters article last month, some Philip Morris ads have disappeared from several tobacco shops in Mumbai."

Sectors which get very strong astrological support are not normally affected by downfall in the market.

These two are considered as non-strategic investments for LIC. While LIC holds 16.29 per cent stake in ITC, it holds 17.97 per cent stake in L&T as of end June.

However, LIC is free to continue with its strategic investments in companies like Corporation Bank (18.9 per cent), LIC Housing Finance (40.3 per cent) and Simplex Realty (22.9 per cent).

LIC has been holding these two companies on behalf of government since UTI was broken up in the early years of the new millennium through Suuti or Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India, along with stakes in Axis Bank.

Suuti, which is managed by an administrator appointed by the Centre, lowered its stake in ITC from 11.12 per cent to 9.10 per cent in February, with LIC picking up the stake for around Rs 6,700 crore via block deals.

""Since LIC has been buying out the Suuti disinvestments in these two scrips and the government would have got the money, we have allowed LIC to reduce its stake in L&T and ITC to 15 per cent by December 2018,"" Nilesh Sathe, member (life, finance & investment), Irdai said here on the sidelines of an industry event organised by CII today.

""LIC can continue its strategic investment in other companies beyond 15 per cent as usual, particularly in Corporation Bank and LIC HF,"" he added.

He further said ""we don't want LIC diluting its investment in any company to create market disruption and so we are willing to consider case-to-case request from LIC to extend the timeline to bring its stake down to 15 per cent.""

Sathe also said the Irdai will be coming out with broking regulation shortly, and a final decision is likely on the next board meeting scheduled for August 28.

The regulator has already issued a discussion paper on the issue which seeks to double capital requirement for different categories of brokers including direct, composite and reinsurance."

Axis Direct's research report on ITC

Gross sales, EBITDA, and adj. PAT grew 4%, 6%, and 7%. Cigarette gross sales and EBIT grew 7% and 9% with 2% volume growth (vs. street estimate of flat to -2%). Other FMCG and hotel sales grew 9% and 6%, while agri and paper sales growth at -1% and 3% disappointed. Non-tobacco EBIT grew 4.5% YoY. Cigarette EBIT growth in Q2 will be watched keenly because of tax increase in July.

Outlook

Over FY17-19, we expect sales/ EPS CAGR of 10%/ 11%. Valuation at FY19E P/E of 28x is not cheap but remains significantly cheap on a relative basis. For long term investors, we see ITC delivering 10-12% EPS CAGR with marginal volume growth in cigarettes but healthy profit growth in non-tobacco with improvement in the economy. Maintain BUY with TP of Rs 330 based on forward P/E of 30x.

Ban of electronic cigarettes in India will increase smuggling of such products, which have no assurance of source and quality standard, according to Tobacco Institute of India (TII).

TII, which represents leading cigarette manufacturers such as ITC, Godfrey Phillips and VST, also said prohibition of e-cigarettes would put India at ""an enormous structural disadvantage versus countries that have espoused a balanced regulatory policy approach on the category"".

The ENDS (Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems), commonly known as electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes have witnessed increasing consumer acceptance in India as is globally, it said in a statement.

""A ban on legal business in ENDS will pose a serious threat of illicit trade and large scale smuggling of these products in the country with no assurance of source and quality standard,"" TII said.

Prohibition would benefit illegal trade operators and promote foreign products owned by overseas entities in the absence of any domestic competition to challenge the illegal trade in these products, it added.

TII further said if a ban were to be imposed on ENDS, the domestic industry would stop all research and innovation in this area.

It would put India at a disadvantage against countries which would have not prohibited ENDS, it added.

""Therefore, all latent and emerging consumer demand for the product in the country would be met through the illicit route,"" TII claimed.

Citing WHO data, TII said the global market for ENDS in 2015 was around USD 10 billion and as per Euromonitor International, it is projected to cross USD 60 billion by 2030.

The health ministry is considering a ban on ENDS, of which e-cigarette is a prototype, after a technical committee evaluated recent research that said e-cigarettes were potentially lethal.

An e-cigarette is a battery-operated device that uses liquid nicotine, propylene glycol, water, glycerin and flavour to give the user the sense of smoking a real cigarette."

Largecap stocks are playing catch-up after years of underperformance as the economy looks on strong footing, strong global as well as domestic flows, political stability, pro-growth reforms as well as attractive valuations.

“The Indian equity market witnessed a strong comeback towards the end of month backed by strong earnings report and favourable macro data. The major turn in the market comes from a large cap space where we witnessed a strong rally after a sluggish performance in past,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“With improved economic fundamentals favouring well-integrated companies in large cap segment coupled with improved business margin & innovative products at the edge, the large cap stock posted a strong performance,” he said.

Rohira further added that a concern over an increased valuation in mid & small cap stock prompted investors to behold with bellwether stock which also contributed to price movement.

Leading from the front was Reliance Industries which gained momentum soon after announcing its results for the quarter ended June 30. The oil & gas major reported 28 percent YoY growth in net profit to Rs9,108 crore and recorded beat on most parameters.

Reliance Industries rallied nearly 17 percent, followed by SBI which rose 14 percent, Wipro gained 11 percent, HDFC added 10.5 percent, and Bharti Airtel rose 10.1 percent in the month of July.

“Large cap stocks like Reliance, ITC, HDFC, DLF IndusInd Bank and L&T have still left room for upside,” Abnish Kumar Sudhanshu, Technical Analyst, Aadya Commodities Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

Among the index companies, Infosys, HDFC Bank, ONGC, Maruti Suzuki were not far behind and made their presence felt last month.

In July, India caught up on its performance compared to its global indices. The MSCI India was up 7.4 percent, outperforming MSCI EM by 2ppt.

On a YoY basis, India continues to underperform MSCI EM and BRIC indices even as India is now outperforming the MSCI DM index.

Sensex's month on month performance was the best since Mar-16. Further, Sensex outperformed small and mid-cap indices during the month even as Sensex has underperformed the broader indices on YTD and YoY basis, Morgan Stanley said in a note.

Market breadth rose with 82% of the stocks trading above their 200DMA. The monthly derivative turnover rose to a new life high and monthly cash volumes rose to its second highest level in history (first being in June-09), it said.

Largecap stocks have mostly underperformed small and midcap peers but July stood out as a strong month in which the tables reversed in favour of the big names.

However, the large part of the rally came from financials, especially from private sector banks, which rose in anticipation of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and strong June quarter results.

Largecaps do give valuations comfort but growth comfort still lies with small and midcap names, suggest experts.

“We must understand that large cap outperformance has largely been anchored by financials which have higher weightage in the index. Moreover, as the earnings season progressed, most of the large cap have witnessed improved profitability and hence the positive reaction to stock prices,” Pankaj Pandey, Head-Research, ICICI Direct told Moneycontrol.

“At the current levels, on a broad base, while large caps offer valuations comfort, midcaps provide growth comfort. We note growth comfort continues to be preferred both domestically and globally,” he said.

He further added that investors need to be market cap agnostic and prefer capital efficient business models with healthy growth visibility going forward."

Edelweiss' research report on ITC

ITC’s Q1FY18 revenue dip of 1% YoY and EBITDA & PAT growth of 6.2% and 7.4% YoY, respectively, came in line with our estimates. Amidst GSTrelated destocking, cigarette and FMCG businesses clocked decent growth. Cigarette volumes rose 1% YoY (3% YoY in Q1FY17), improving from flattish in Q4FY17. Similarly, FMCG sales surge at 9.0% YoY (9.5% YoY in Q1FY17) was better than 6.5% YoY in Q4FY17; we expect the FMCG business to grow in double digits in FY18 aided by entry in new segments.

Outlook

We maintain ‘HOLD/SP’ and value ITC on SOTP on FY19E to arrive at target price of INR304. The stock is currently trading at 26.6x FY19E EPS.

Barring TCS and HUL, rest eight companies, including Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), ITC, SBI and Maruti Suzuki, saw a rise in their market capitalisation (m-cap) for the week ended Friday.

Among the gainers, HDFC's valuation zoomed Rs 22,650.95 crore to Rs 2,84,140.36 crore.

The m-cap of HDFC Bank jumped Rs 19,579.63 crore to Rs 4,58,002.04 crore while that of State Bank of India (SBI) soared Rs 7,639.37 crore to Rs 2,58,270.95 crore.

Infosys added Rs 4,123.01 crore to reach Rs 2,29,200.62 crore in market capitalisation and ITC also saw an addition of Rs 3,344.5 crore to Rs 3,54,212.97 crore.

The m-cap of Maruti went up by Rs 2,850.12 crore to Rs 2,30,243.91 crore and that of RIL rose by Rs 2,617.65 crore to Rs 5,18,408.04 crore.

ITC shares gained more than 2 percent in early trade Friday but wiped out some gains as the day progressed. Majority of analysts retain their positive stance on the stock, especially after cigarettes' earnings matched expectations and FMCG business surprised the Street in Q1.

Quantitatively, ITC posted an in-line set of numbers across parameters – cigarette gross revenues grew by 6.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 8,770 crore and overall profit increased 7 percent to Rs 2,560 crore. EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) at Rs 3,750 crore was also in line.

Qualitatively, net price / mix were also better – with cigarette EBIT growing 9 percent YoY to Rs 3,270 crore (around 5 percent ahead of estimates), Citi said, adding other FMCG revenue growth positively surprised too, up 9 percent YoY (beating estimates around 7 percent), partly attributed to lower exposure to the CSD channel. The offset was weaker profitability in the agri business due to lower revenues / exports.

While maintaining a buy call with a target price of Rs 325, Citi feels the valuation discount is compelling versus peer group.

""We see a continued near term overhang on the stock given the recent tax hikes which should impact volumes over Q2, but that is factored into the recent correction in our view,"" it said.

Macquarie said cigarette volume growth came in at 2 percent YoY versus the consensus estimate of a decline of 1–2 percent, which it believes a great outcome given that GST destocking impacted numbers.

With maintaining an outperform rating and target price of Rs 340, Macquarie said, ""We are building in 0/1 percent cigarette volume growth for FY18/19. We believe Q2FY18 cigarette volume trends will be critical for the rest of the year.""

Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects a gradual revival in volumes in cigarettes as the trade channel normalises and price increases are adapted.

Also, blended price changes taken by ITC absorb higher taxes and should not materially upset FY18 volume trajectory in cigarettes, according to the research house.

ITC's share price has declined nearly 15 percent after the announcement of GST rate revisions on July 17. ""This seems unreasonable to us and offers a particularly attractive opportunity to buy, in our view. We reiterate buy rating,"" BofAML said but it slashed target price to Rs 375 from Rs 390 earlier.

Nomura also maintained its buy rating on ITC as it believes risk-reward remains favourable and all negatives are factored in, but reduced target price to Rs 356 from Rs 389 earlier following cut in revenue/EBITDA/PAT estimates by 3/4.5/4.4 percent, respectively.

Post the results, the research house changed its earnings estimates to account for the GST rate changes, the price increase and the resultant softness in volumes.

The near-term setback of increased taxation under GST notwithstanding, Nomura believes long-term growth prospects remain intact. Cigarette business now faces uniform taxation which would also be changing infrequently under the new GST regimen, which is a significant positive, it feels.

Moreover, the FMCG business (foods in particular) continues to go from strength to strength, with strong growth which is likely to improve further on the back of economic revival, according to the research house.

CLSA, which had sell rating on the stock before earnings, upgraded that to underperform with a target price of Rs 285, especially after recent sharp correction.

The research house sees limited triggers for ITC until clarity emerges on the volume trend post price hikes or perhaps a modest tax hike next year.

The global investment bank believes that the company can deliver 5 percent cigarette volume growth in FY19-20. Moreover, the steep pricing taken in FY18 will lead to slower volume growth.

Goldman Sachs has neutral rating on the stock.

""We believe that ITC can deliver around 5 percent cigarette volume growth in FY19-20 as they capture market share from the informal markets. However, we believe the steep pricing taken in FY18 will lead to slower volume growth and higher down-trading. As a result of weaker mix assumptions we lower FY18-20EPS by 3-4 percent and lower 12-month target price to Rs 315 (from Rs 321),"" it explained.

At 11:56 hours IST, the stock price was quoting at Rs 289.30, up Rs 0.65, or 0.23 percent on the BSE.

Q) What are your views on the market which hit 10,000 peaks and has delivered about 22 percent return so far in the year 2017? How is the second half of the year expected to pan out? Do you think it is time for investors to book some profits and buy again on dips?

A) We do believe the Indian markets are currently overvalued especially in light of elusive earnings growth. On the back of stretched valuations and limited investable opportunities, we increased allocation to cash (now at 20% portfolio weight) in our recent G&C portfolio as well.

With GST led disruption likely to continue affecting earnings over the next couple of quarters we have no reason to believe that earnings growth will pan out anywhere close to high double digit consensus expectations.

As a result, risk reward trade-off is currently not in favor of further equity investments and we suggest investors wait for better levels to re-enter the markets.

Q) If somebody comes with you with a monthly investment of Rs15,000-20,000 to realise his crorepati dream. Can he realise his dream by investing in direct equities or it is better to go via MF route? What is minimum capital required to start trading?

A) Direct equities can be difficult as it requires a lot of discipline, research, and concentrated bets. Someone with monthly investments of Rs15-20K but with an investment time horizon of 15-20 years should choose a basket of good companies like the Coffee Can Portfolio Approach highlighted by our team or MF schemes focusing on high-quality companies run by good capital allocators.

Q) Gush of liquidity has already pushed markets across the globe to fresh highs. What are your views on global markets and experts say that a big correction in India market can only be triggered if there is a global trigger? What are your views?

A) The US 10 year yields have seen their sharp rise post Trump election reverse over the course of CY2017. While the US Fed has signaled its intention of unwinding the QE program and raising rates, it remains to be seen if the US growth can continue on the steady path of the last few quarters – allowing the Fed to raise rates without jeopardizing growth.

A sharp increase in rates can cause short term jitters globally as the cost of money goes up. The rise in Indian markets, however, has largely been driven by retail inflows into the Mutual funds.

Certain sectors, in particular, have gained the favor of this excess liquidity which has led to their valuations reaching stratospheric levels.

While a global event (geopolitical or otherwise) can certainly be a potential party spoiler, we think that the Indian markets face a bigger risk from lack of underlying earnings growth in line with overblown market expectations.

Q) How are you seeing ITC stocks after a recent increase in cess by the government? Do you think the smart money will move out of ITC to other stocks like HUL, Britannia etc?

A) We acknowledge that recent hike in Cess was unexpected and a negative surprise. However, we believe that all that it has done is to make FY18 a normal year (with 13% tax hike, in line with last 5-year average) vs being an exceptionally good year with close to 0% tax hikes.

We have maintained our view that FY18 would have been a one-off good year and structurally ITC would remain a 12-13% EPS CAGR story led by 0-2% volume growth, 5-6% realization growth and some margin gains and profitability turn around in FMCG providing support.

We see no reason for the change in this thesis and expect 10% tax hikes and similar price hikes to continue going forward as well for ITC which should lead to marginally positive volume growth trajectory for Cigarettes.

ITC has taken 7-8 percent price hikes recently with lower end brands witnessing higher hikes and the premium end has seen lower hikes (as this end has ad valorem taxation).

We believe ITC’s price hike is marginally ahead of our estimates and steep hikes at the lower end are equal to risk to volume growth. But, it would also mean higher than expected margins.

Hence, we maintain our earnings estimate. We admit that ITC’s 12-13% EPS CAGR over FY17-20E pales in comparison with FMCG sector’s expected EPS CAGR of 16-17% but so does its valuation which at 26xFY19E is at ~30% discount to the sector.

Disclaimer: Ambit and/or its associates do not have any interest in ITC.

Q) Any particular instance you recall when you were interacting with your clients which were funny or made you think twice about the problem or taught you something?

Madhuchanda Dey

Moneycontrol Research

ITC reported single-digit earnings growth in a quarter marked by GST pangs and regulatory headwinds. The recent cess on cigarettes under GST appears to have dampened sentiment for the stock somewhat. However, we believe GST minimises the vagaries of state-level taxations, and the discount of ITC to the FMCG universe is an opportunity for long-term investors.

Quarter at a glance

ITC’s gross revenues rose 4 percent, and operating margin improved over the previous as well as the corresponding quarter. The double-digit growth in other income and muted increase in interest and depreciation expenses aided the 7 percent growth in profitability.

The gainers and losers



CigaretteThe value growth in the cigarette business was 6.6 percent during the quarter. Volume sales rose 1 percent against the Street expectation of a decline or negative volume growth. The growth in profitability was higher at 9 percent due to margin expansion.

The management estimates the combined impact of increase in excise duty, and the recent GST cess to result in an additional 20 percent-plus tax burden. The company recently raised prices of select brands. The impact of higher taxes on the cigarette business’ margin will be clearer in the ensuing quarter and would be watched closely as it contributes the lion’s share (above 85 percent) to the profitability of the company.

FMCG

ITC is gradually building up a meaningful FMCG business that grew 9 percent in a subdued demand environment during the quarter. Revenue growth was driven primarily by the branded packaged foods, personal care and stationery products. But growth was tempered by the restructuring of the retail divisions, an early 'end of season sale' and heavy discounting triggered by GST transition.

Profitability was impacted by higher input costs (wheat, oil, soap noodles, sugar), sustained investment in brand building and gestation costs of new categories viz. juices, dairy, chocolates, and health & hygiene segment in the Personal Care Products business.

Hotels

In the hotels business, the over 6 percent growth in revenue was driven by improvement in average room rate, and higher food & beverages sales. The year-on-year improvement in profitability could be attributed to operating leverage and costs management. However, certain properties like ITC Grand Chola, Chennai lost out on account of the ban on sale of liquor at outlets on the edge of highways. The gestation costs of the recently commissioned ITC Grand Bharat, Gurgaon also had an impact.

Agri Business

Revenue and profitability of the agri business were under pressure due to lower crop output, the adverse quality of the Andhra leaf tobacco crop due to drought in 2016, and limited trading opportunities in other agri-commodities. However, this business for ITC provides a critical linkage to rural India and supports sourcing of tobacco for the cigarette business and agri raw materials for the food business.

Paperboards, Paper & Packaging

The performance of the paperboards, paper & packaging segment was impacted due to sluggish demand conditions prevailing in the FMCG and cigarette industries. In addition, de-stocking of FMCG and pharma products in trade channels ahead of the transition to GST, and the ban on sale of liquor from outlets near highways weighed on sales. Profitability, however, improved on the back of benign input prices and richer product mix.

The way ahead

While GST has impacted the company in more than one ways in the quarter, it continues to be a long-term positive for an organised player like ITC. India today is the 4th largest market for illegal cigarettes in the world. It is estimated that almost 68 percent of the tobacco consumed in the country remains outside the tax net on account of evasion.

Although legal cigarettes account for only about 11 percent of total tobacco consumption in the country, they contribute more than 87 percent of tax revenue from the tobacco sector. The other types of tobacco products contribute barely 13 percent of tax revenue despite accounting for 89 percent of total tobacco consumption. We expect GST to hurt the unorganised sector more than ITC where the rates have only gone up incrementally.

At 30 times FY18 projected earnings ITC offers quality and value for long term investors."

AxisDirect's research report on ITC

We were never comfortable with the reduced taxes; we held on to our estimates/ TP and with difficulty ignored the Street celebrations even as we tried to understand the reasons for the lower taxes(SUUTI stake sale was too naïve a reason) which now turns out to be an excel sheet error in North Block. All we see now is that tax has increased by 14% in FY18 which is the sixth consecutive year of double digit increase.

Outlook

For long term investors, we see ITC delivering 10-12% EPS CAGR with marginal or no volume growth in cigarettes but healthy profit growth in non-tobacco with improvement in the economy.

The Nifty50 makes a bullish breakout after a ‘Hammer’ pattern last week indicating the upward move to continue in the near-term. It hit a new all-time high of 9,982 on Monday.

It has given a consolidation breakout of the range that was being observed in the last couple of weeks with 9,900 as resistance while support was placed at 9,800.

A fresh breakout with participation led by heavyweights suggests an up move may continue while 10,000 now being within reach. A strong closing as well suggests the trend may continue for the coming sessions.

Main heavyweight components saw higher participation with buying seen in Reliance, ITC, HDFC Bank, Axis, TCS and Infosys as well. This further improves the undertone and sentiment in the short term.

As far as resistance is concerned, we expect it to come around 10,050 mark while next resistance on the clearing of first will be seen at 10,200.

On the downside, support comes at 9900 as a fresh base and then at 9,820. Traders can buy on dips with select stocks in heavyweight being kept on the radar.

Fundamentally, the valuations are stretched and that is why we are seeing slow movement in the index with select stocks gaining majorly.

The Nifty PE at 25x odd levels with a gain of 30 percent is certainly not favorable for short term investors as the market will align itself with earnings that will be reported.

We are expecting that to be somewhere in two digits around 15 percent. The exponential move that we have seen needs to be justified in short term with some corrections. Also, recent gains were majorly due to discounting of GST into the prices.

Here is a list of top five stocks which can give up to 5% return in intraday trade:

Tata Steel: SELL| Target Rs530| Stop Loss Rs560| Return 3%

It has seen a formation of a bearish structure with a negative close and resistance of crucial moving averages suggesting a more bearish move to Rs530.

Raymond: BUY| Target Rs835| Stop Loss Rs785| Return 3%

The stock is seeing a bullish Mat and Hold formation on bigger time frame charts along with the support of long term moving averages suggesting an up move in coming sessions which can take Nifty towards its next target of Rs835.

Apollo Tyres: BUY| Target Rs265| Stop Loss Rs250| Return 4%

The stock has seen a positive cross of moving averages and is on the verge of a breakout towards next target of Rs265

ITC: BUY| Target Rs305| Stop Loss Rs288| Return 4%

The stock has seen a rebound after a heavy sell off pushing the price back into the previous trading range of Rs305 - 310 while a stop loss can be placed at Rs288.

Bata India: BUY| Target Rs620| Stop Loss Rs575| Return 5%

The stock has seen a structural breakout of bullish pattern and is in an upward move to test the next resistance which is our set target of Rs620.

ITC shares gained as much as 2.4 percent in morning trade Monday as the cigarette major hiked select product prices following GST Council hiked cess to pre-GST level.

The company increased cigarette prices of its three brands effective July 18, reports CNBC-TV18 quoting sources of Cogencis.

It hiked Gold Flake Kings and Classic Rich prices to Rs 300 per 20 pack each while Navy Cut Filter price increased to Rs 188 per 20 pack.

Macquarie also said based on its channel checks with several distributors, ITC has taken price hikes to compensate for higher cess in the GST regime.

According to the brokerage firm, the 84mm segment (Gold Flake Kings and Classic) price increase is of 7 percent to Rs 15 per stick. In 69mm segment, the price increase in Gold Flake franchise is 6-11 percent. In the 64mm segment, the price increase in Gold Flake Superstar and Gold Flake Century is around 9 percent. For other 64mm brands, while Bristol saw price increase of 20 percent (to Rs 6/stick), Capstan saw no price increase.

The price hike is taken across significant part of the portfolio keeping the coinage factor and competitive intensity in mind, it said.

The weighted average price hike is around 7-8 percent, which the research believes will compensate for increase in cess.

""While, the price hike will help ITC to maintain its realisation per stick, we believe it will put pressure on the volume,"" Macquarie said.

It further said, ""We are not building significant decline in FY18 as we believe phased price increase will not lead to similar impact as against price increase at one go. Also, we believe a rural recovery in second half of FY18 will help compensate the impact of price hike. Lastly, we expect volume growth in Q118 (based on channel checks) which will help offset volume decline in few quarters.""

Macquarie believes the stock will underperform in the near term on a lower earnings growth trajectory and valuation discount, though it has retained outperform rating on the stock with target price of Rs 340.

Morgan Stanley reiterated its equal-weight rating on the stock and believes that the next catalyst for the stock will likely be the Union Budget (February 2018) and the tobacco tax policy therein.

The stock price lost 13 percent on last Tuesday, especially after the GST Council, on July 17, reviewed the compensation cess rates in cigarettes and raised tax by 10-14 percent for all cigarette lengths other than the King Size (KSFT) segment wherein the tax increase is around 23 percent.

At 10:00 hours IST, the stock price was quoting at Rs 293.45, up Rs 4.95, or 1.72 percent on the BSE.

ITC which got hammered on Tuesday after the government increased the cess on cigarettes but it is unlikely to lose its charm among fund managers, suggest analysts. The smart money is unlikely to move out considerably from ITC or HUL.

The number of funds holding ITC increased from 376 recorded in the month of May to 381 in the month of June with an aggregate market value of Rs16,593 crore, according to Morningstar India data.

On the other hand, the number of funds holding HUL decreased from 219 funds in the month of May to 211 funds in the month of June with an aggregate value of Rs3664 crore.

The decision of GST Council meeting earlier this week to increase the cess on cigarettes wiped out Rs50,000 crore of investors’ wealth on Tuesday from ITC when the stock crashed nearly 13 percent.

The stock had plunged 15 percent in intra-day trade on Tuesday, the sharpest fall in a decade, to hit a low of Rs 276.4 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

The increase in cess, according to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, was taken to “reduce profiteering by companies and harm to public health,” but that didn’t go well for investors.

After a sharp fall, there were reports that smart money might move into HUL which might become the next favoured choice for investors in the FMCG space.

However, analysts which Moneycontrol spoke to have a mixed view as 2 out of 3 experts feel that ITC will still attract smart money as HUL is trading at slightly stretched valuations.

“We believe ITC will give superior returns after Tuesday’s fall. In past as well, tax rates have been increased on several occasions. This could be a temporary phenomenon and the FMCG major is available at reasonable valuations compared to other FMCG players,” Rahul Shah, VP - Equity advisory, MOSL told Moneycontrol.

“On one hand, HUL trades at a rich valuation. The biggest problem with the sector is volume growth, so after this event, we might see some volume de-growth in ITC. But, lower valuation augurs well for ITC,” he said.

Increased compensation cess on cigarettes leads to 8-9 percent increase in effective tax rate for ITC. If ITC takes a price hike then it might lead to lower sales and single-digit EBIT growth in the cigarette business.

Reacting to the news event, most global brokerage firms have already downgraded the stock and lowered their respective target price.

Credit Suisse downgraded ITC to neutral from outperform and also slashed target price to Rs310 from Rs400 following cut in FY18-20 estimates by 10-12 percent.

Morgan Stanley, too, downgraded the stock to equal-weight from overweight and reduced target price to Rs 285 from Rs 395, saying it is a clear negative with obvious impact on volume growth and valuation multiples.

According to the research house, ITC will need 12-13 percent weighted average cigarette price hike here on with around 20 percent price increase in KSFT segment to offset the tax increase.

Given that ITC has already taken around 4 percent price hike versus an average of FY17, it expects an incremental 8-9 percent pricing action over the next few days, said the report.

Investors should understand that the fall in ITC's share price is a temporary phenomenon seen due to a hike in the effective GST rates on cigarettes.

“If we have a look at the past tax increase on cigarettes in the past budgets the history suggests it is a non-event from a profitability point of view. In fact, falls arising from such an event always was a great opportunity to invest,” Jimeet Modi, CEO, SAMCO Securities told Moneycontrol.

“The 5-year CAGR sales growth of ITC has 6.74 percent while HUL's sales have grown by only 4.2 percent. ITC's profits have increased by 6.25 percent 5-year CAGR while HUL's have increased by only 3.2 percent 5-year CAGR. This shows that even after the tax hikes, ITC performs better than HUL,” he said.

Modi further added that the smart money is more likely to move to ITC because HUL is currently trading at a PE and PB of 66 and 37 times respectively while ITC is trading at PE and PB of 36 and 8.52 respectively.

Commenting on the price action, Modi said that ITC's stock plummets at every tax hike and then start rising again in 20-25 days. This is the right time to buy the stock.

However, some analysts are of the view that HUL will find some flows trickle into the counter post increase in cess on ITC after the FMCG major reported a stellar performance in the June quarter.

HUL delivered a stellar performance in Q4FY2017, beating D-Street expectation with high single digit revenue growth and OPM improving by almost 100bps despite a significant increase in the raw material prices.

“HUL is a better play in the FMCG as it will be one of the key beneficiaries of implementation of GST and recovery in the rural demand,” Kaustubh Pawaskar, analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol.

“We expect volume growth to improve in H2FY2018 and would gradually improve in the subsequent years. So, it becomes a better play in the large cap FMCG space. We believe that investors might opt for stocks with better-earning visibility in the term coupled with decent valuations at the current juncture and wait for a better entry point to enter HUL,” he said."

ICICI Direct's research report on ITC

In the review meeting of the GST Council on tax rates, the council has raised the specific cess on cigarettes in all categories below 75 mm. Also, it has sharply increase d the ad - valorem rate in above 75 mm category. We believe this would increase the blended tax incidence per stick from | 3.2 to | 3.9, resulting in more than | 5000 crore excess tax burden for the industry compare d to earlier GST rates or | 3800 crore excess burden compared to pre - GST regime. We believe ITC would need to take a price hike of ~12% to pass on the additional tax burden. We change our volume estimates from earlier 4 % to 1 % for FY18E and simultaneously change our realisation estimate from 5 % to 12 %. For FY19E also, we are revising our volume estimates down wards from 4% to 1%.

Outlook

Post the revision in rates, we are factoring in 1 .0% volume growth f o r both FY18 E and FY19E. Further, to pass on the tax burden, we estimate that ITC would have to take 12% and 8% price hike for FY18E and FY19E, respectively. Our revenue estimate is, thus, getting revised marginally upwards by 2.2% for FY18E and remains flat for FY19E. However, with increased tax incidence, our PAT estimates are getting revised down wards by 13.6% and 14.6% for FY18E and FY19E, respectively. In a scenario where volume growth would continue to remain under pressure, we assign lower multiple to cigarettes business of 30x against 35x earlier. We value the cigarettes business at | 247 ( PE multiple of 3 0 x FY19E EPS ) , FMCG at | 44 (4x MCap/sales FY19E ), paperboards at | 4 (3x FY19E EV/EBITDA), agri - business at | 6 (3x P/BV FY19E) and hotels at | 7 ( 2x EV/room FY19E) and also add the cash per share of | 1 0 . We downgrade ITC to HOLD with a target price of | 317.For all recommendations report, click here

Edelweiss Securities' research report on ITC

In a negative surprise, the GST Council on Monday stepped in to check the windfall being reaped by cigarette manufacturers and increased effective tax under GST by ~10-11% which will result in MRP increase of ~8-9%. This with 6% hike in the Budget 2017-18 amounts to ~16-17% total hike in taxes for FY18. So, why was this unexpected? The Budget had sprung a positive surprise with mere 6% tax hike (lowest hike in past 6 years) coupled with relatively softer stance in earlier GST. In the past (FY13-16), when the hike in tax was ~18% on an average, ITC’s volumes declined by ~20% over the period. Accordingly, we cut our cigarette volume estimates for FY18/19 to 5% / 2% YoY decline versus 5%/5% YoY growth, respectively. Ergo, we cut EPS estimates by 5.6%/8.2% YoY for FY18/19 respectively and cigarette business multiple to 27x (30x earlier). We downgrade to ‘HOLD’.

Outlook

We cut our volume assumptions for FY18E and FY19E to a decline of 5% YoY and 2% YoY respectively and hence cut our EPS estimates by 5.6%/8.2% YoY for FY18/19 respectively. We downgrade to ‘HOLD/ Sector Performer’ from ‘BUY/Sector outformer’. We value ITC on SoTP basis on FY19E and arrive at a target price of INR304.For all recommendations report, click here

ITC tumbled nearly 15 percent in trade on Tuesday, a day after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council decided to increase the cess on cigarettes.

The total market capitalisation of ITC on the BSE contracted from Rs 3,96,171.25 crore recorded on Monday to Rs 3,48.629 crore on Tuesday, which translates into a notional loss of Rs 47,542 crore at the time of publishing this story.

ITC which holds a weightage of 7.2 percent in Sensex was the biggest contributor for the declines in the index.

ITC shares which are still up 18 percent after Tuesday’s fall gained momentum after a brokerage upgraded the stock soon after GST rates were announced.

However, after the GST Council raised the cess on cigarettes on Monday, many brokerages revised their estimates on the downside.

The foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) are among the major stakeholders in ITC, followed by insurance major LIC. FPIs hold 19.99 percent stake in ITC as per shareholding data for the quarter ended June, followed by LIC which holds 16.25 percent, and financial institutions or banks which have 9.18 percent stake.

Both FPIs and LIC pared their positions slightly on a sequential basis. The last shareholding data suggests that FPIs stake in ITC at the end of March quarter stood at 20.04 percent which was higher than 19.99 percent recorded in June quarter, BSE data showed.

LIC stake in ITC stood at 16.26 percent for the quarter ended March, which was slightly higher than 16.25 percent recorded in June, showed the data.

Credit Suisse downgraded ITC to neutral from outperform and also slashed target price to Rs 310 from Rs 400 following cut in FY18-20 estimates by 10-12 percent.

Morgan Stanley, too, downgraded the stock to equal-weight from overweight and reduced target price to Rs 285 from Rs 395, saying it is a clear negative with obvious impact on volume growth and valuation multiples.

According to the research house, ITC will need 12-13 percent weighted average cigarette price hike hereon with around 20 percent price increase in KSFT segment to offset the tax increase.

However, analysts’ on D-Street are not writing an official obituary for the stock as of now. Most of them feel that the stock will continue to face pressure but after the sharp fall, many funds will line-up to buy the stock on declines. The next trigger will be the tax hikes in the next year's annual Budget.

“The long term growth potential will not get impacted for ITC. There is a lot of interest in ITC at current levels, and many funds don't have ITC and they wanted to buy after 15 percent fall on Monday,” A.K.Prabhakar, Head -Research at IDBI Capital told Moneycontrol."

The Nifty50 which was trading well above 9900 on Monday and was just a few points away from the magical figure of 10,000, saw a gap down opening on Tuesday largely led by losses in ITC as investors preferred to dump the stocks after brokerage houses downgraded the stock.

Top global brokerage house pared their expectations with respect to ITC which holds one of the highest weightage in the Nifty which led to sharp fall in the index.

The stock saw a deep cut of 15 percent in trade after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council decided to increase the cess on cigarettes. Other stocks like Godfrey Phillips (down 10 percent) and VST Industries (down 10 percent) also caught in a bear grip.

Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to neutral from outperform and also slashed target price to Rs 310 from Rs 400 following cut in FY18-20 estimates by 10-12 percent.

SBI, Aurobindo Pharma, Federal Bank, ITC and HDFC saw maximum value change on a month-on-month (MoM) basis while Reliance Industries, L&T, Tata Motors, ICICI Bank and IOC saw a maximum decline in value.

Overall, fund manager remains upbeat on markets as domestic mutual fund (MF) industry average AUM increased for the 15th consecutive quarter in 2QCY17 to a new high of Rs 19.6 lakh crore.

On a YoY basis, average AUM saw a 35 percent rise, primarily on account of inflows in growth (equity), income and liquid funds, backed by increased participation of domestic investors in equity schemes, said a Motilal Oswal report.

Equity AUM rose for the seventh consecutive month in June scaled to a new high of Rs 5.9 lakh crore (+1.3% MoM and +38% YoY). The increase in equity AUM was led by a rise in equity scheme sales while redemptions rose 38 percent on a MoM basis to Rs183 bn, it said.

ITC shares crashed 15 percent intraday Tuesday, the biggest intraday fall since 2012, as brokerage houses downgraded the stock after the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council decided to increase the cess on cigarettes. However, the stock shot up 35 percent since the beginning of 2017 (till July 17).

Other stocks like Godfrey Phillips (down 10 percent) and VST Industries (down 7 percent) also caught in bear grip.

Credit Suisse downgraded ITC to neutral from outperform and also slashed target price to Rs 310 from Rs 400 following cut in FY18-20 estimates by 10-12 percent.

It feels the stock will continue to face pressure on earnings progressively and the next trigger will be the tax hikes in the next year's annual Budget.

Rates have been changed for six categories of cigarettes on Monday. For non-filter cigarettes, not exceeding 65 mm, the rate has been increased to 5 percent plus Rs 2,076 per thousand sticks from existing rate of 5 percent plus Rs 1,591.

Similarly, for filter cigarettes exceeding 65 mm length but not more than 70 mm, rate has been increased by Rs 621 per thousand sticks and cigarettes exceeding 70 mm length but not more than 75 mm, rate has been increased by Rs 792 per thousand sticks.

New ad valorem rates on cigarettes above 75 mm stood at 36 percent.

The revised rates (effective July 18) will raise tax by 11-15 percent for all cigarette lengths other than the King Size (KSFT) segment wherein the tax increase is around 21 percent versus that in FY17.

""This implies that ITC will have to hike prices by 5-10 percent across its portfolio to maintain net realisation per stick, and will have to hike prices by an average of 8-9 percent to see a meaningful increase in net sales per stick, which is needed for driving earnings growth,"" Credit Suisse said.

CLSA also said this cess hike forced to downgrade the stock to sell from buy and cut target price to Rs 285 from Rs 417 on lower earnings as well as cut in cigarette business multiple.""

It cut EPS estimates by 6-10 percent as it lowered cigarettes EBIT forecast to mid-single digits.

CLSA feels sharp rise in KSFT (84mm) may force ITC to explore longs (74mm) as an option to optimise tax and protect volumes but over time, and the company would need to raise prices by around 5 percent just to maintain net realisations.

Morgan Stanley, too, downgraded the stock to equal-weight from overweight and reduced target price to Rs 285 from Rs 395, saying it is a clear negative with obvious impact on volume growth and valuation multiples.

According to the research house, ITC will need 12-13 percent weighted average cigarette price hike hereon with around 20 percent price increase in KSFT segment to offset tax increase.

Given that ITC has already taken around 4 percent price hike versus average of FY17, it expects an incremental 8-9 percent pricing action over the next few days.

Morgan Stanley expects 3 percent volume decline in FY18 versus earlier estimate of 5 percent growth and expects 6 percent cigarette business EBIT growth versus 20 percent earlier.

The government on Monday said that it miscalculated the tax on cigarettes. Its method of calibrating the cess did not take into consideration the cascading of taxes. This led to a lower tax incidence under GST. According to the government, this is 'unacceptable' in case of demerit goods like cigarettes.

In May, the Council headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had fixed the rate for the demerit goods — cigarettes — in the highest tax slab of 28 percent and a cess over and above the tax rate, which would ultimately go to the compensation kitty of the states.

The compensation cess had two components — an ad valorem of 5 percent and an increasing numerical amount and on each category of filter and non-filter cigarette.

While the 28 percent tax and an ad valorem at 5 percent will remain, the numerical value of cess on cigarettes will be increased from midnight, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said adding that the total revenue impact of this is expected to be Rs 5,000 crore.

“Now this rate (fixed by the fitment committee) when translated as a part of cost of the cigarette itself, indicated that the impact of the cascading effect has not been factored in. Therefore, it was resulting in a windfall profit for cigarette companies,” Jaitley said after the conclusion of the 19th GST Council meeting.

Meanwhile, ICICI Securities downgraded VST Industries to hold with a target price of Rs 3,430 as it believes that with around 16 percent increase in tax incidence compared to pre-GST level, cigarette volumes would continue to remain under pressure.

""With increased tax incidence, PAT estimates get revised downwards by 9.2 percent and 13.3 percent for FY18 and FY19, respectively,"" it said.

At 09:36 hours IST, ITC was quoting at Rs 285.95, down 12.22 percent while VST Industries was down 3.5 percent at Rs 3,435 and Godfrey Phillips India down 4.98 percent at Rs 1,166.35 amid high volumes on the BSE."

3:10 pm Buzzing: VST Industries shares tumbled nearly 8 percent intraday after the GST Council headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley raised the specific cess on cigarettes in all categories below 75 mm.

While downgrading the stock to hold with a target price of Rs 3,430, ICICI Securities said it believes this would increase the blended tax incidence per stick from Rs 2.3 to Rs 2.9.

The government, on Monday, has kept the GST rate of 28 percent and cess of 5 percent for the below 75 mm category and raised the specific cess per stick from Rs 1.59 to Rs 2.17 on below 65 mm category, from Rs 2.12 to Rs 2.84 for regular size category.

The S&P BSE Sensex is trading in unchartered waters and allocating fresh money at these levels could be one of the toughest decision to make for any investor as chances of profit booking cannot be ruled out.

The Nifty too is chasing 10,000 level which is likely to act as stiff resistance for the index and market should cool off post the event, suggest experts. However, a major decline is not something which analysts’ see unless it gets triggered by a global event.

“The market psychology is defensive at this time since almost all participants are positioned for a correction. This is giving some cushion on the downside. In all likelihood any correction will be on account of global developments and not local ones,” Anshul Saigal - Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager – Kotak Mutual Fund told Moneycontrol.

Considering the fact that Indian market is dancing on tunes of global liquidity and any knee-jerk reaction in global markets could also pull Indian markets lower. Indian market is already trading in overbought zone and at a trailing P/E of 25x which was last seen in 2010, and 2008.

“10,000 on Nifty is a huge technical resistance and Sensex/Nifty P/E’s are also hitting 25x so from both angles investors should be cautious especially since when both these factors reach resistances then there is usually a good 10-15 percent decline over the next few months,” Rishi Kolhi, CEO, ProAlpha Capital told Moneycontrol.

“Also, there are global inter-market divergences with some indices like India’s hitting new highs while many are below their previous highs and this has also been a good signal for a halt to the uptrend in the past,” he said.

Kolhi advises investors to use the up move to book profits and re-enter in the decline where one can start investing at 9,500.

The ideal strategy for investors would be to pick up quality names on declines because the bullish sentiment is likely to continue in the market. With the no initial hiccups in the GST implementation, indirect tax collection is expected to improve going ahead.

The direct tax collection figures were also good in the first quarter of the current fiscal with personal advance tax increasing by 40 percent, suggest experts.

“While this is a long term story, the short term story is the possibility of rate cut fuelled by the weak IIP data and lower inflation,” Shrikant Akolkar, Sr. Equity Research Analyst, Angel Broking Pvt Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“The market is trading between 18-19x of its one-year consensus forward earnings and investors should stick to the quality companies. While we are optimistic, profit booking may give fresh buying opportunities in the quality companies,” he said.

Here is a list of 15 quality stocks which analysts’ feel are a good buy even at current levels:

Analyst: Jay Purohit, Technical & Derivatives Analyst at Centrum Broking Limited

Fortis Healthcare: BUY

The pharma space is going through a tough time from last few months. In line with the peers, the ‘Fortis Healthcare’ too seen a decent correction in the recent past.

Investors can take a long entry in the counter on every decline towards the mentioned zone for an upside target of Rs200 – Rs215 in the upcoming quarter. The stop loss should be kept below Rs135 on a closing basis.

Apollo Hospitals: BUY

The stock is moving in a sideways direction from last few months and currently rebounding from the Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) of a Bullish Harmonic Pattern named as ‘Bullish Gartley’ on the daily chart.

The ‘RSI’ oscillator has turned northwards from its support of 30-35 on the daily chart, indicating strength in the counter. Thus, we advise traders to go long in the stock on every decline towards Rs1230 for a target of Rs1325 – Rs. 1340. The stop loss for the trade should be kept at below Rs1305.

Reliance Industries: BUY

After a decent rally from 1013 to 1467, the stock has started moving in a sideway direction. However, in last week, we witnessed a breakout from the consolidation phase of the last couple of months.

The breakout supported by healthy volumes and thus suggesting a sustainable move in the upcoming session. The ‘RSI’ oscillator, which measures the stock momentum, has given a trend line breakout on the daily chart, indicating strength in the counter.

Considering the above mentioned technical evidence; we are expecting a continuation in ongoing momentum in near term too. Hence, we advise traders to buy this stock for a target of Rs 1630 - 1650. The stop loss should be fixed at Rs 1460.

Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.

Ujjivan Financial: BUY

The stock has made a ‘Double Bottom’ pattern and has started rebounding from last few sessions. After many weeks, we witnessed a ‘Higher Highs Higher Lows’ formation on the daily chart of the stock, indicating bullishness in the counter.

Going forward, we are expecting the stock to reach towards Rs390 – Rs400 in near term. Thus, traders are advised to initiate long positions with a stop loss of Rs317.

Marico: BUY

The stock is moving in a strong uptrend by maintaining ‘Higher Highs Higher Lows’ on the weekly and monthly chart. From last three months, the stock was moving in a sideways direction and Thursday, we witnessed a breakout from the consolidation phase.

Since moving averages and momentum oscillator is also indicating strength in the counter, we are upbeat on the stock for a target of Rs. 360 – 365 in near term. The protective stop loss should be kept below Rs 314.

Analyst: Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan

HDFC Bank: BUY

HDFC Bank has a pre-eminent presence in the retail banking segment (50% of loan book) and has been able to maintain a strong & consistent loan book growth, gradually gaining market share.

Also, as lending and transactions through formal routes increase, HDFC Bank would benefit since it is a leading private sector bank and it is likely that it will gain market share in this segment.

The bank is likely to maintain a healthy RoE of 18-20% and ROA of 1.8% on a sustainable basis. Therefore, we expect it to sustain the valuation premium that it enjoys vis-à-vis other private banks.

IndusInd Bank: BUY

IndusInd Bank has maintained its asset quality despite sluggish economic growth and a higher proportion of retail finance in its loan book. A likely revival in the domestic economy will further fuel growth in the bank’s consumer finance division while strong capital ratios will support future growth plans.

Though demonetisation has raised questions regarding delinquencies in certain lending segments, the management expects the asset quality to remain under control. The stock should continue to trade at a premium valuation, underpinned by strong loan growth, quality management, high RoAs and healthy asset quality.

ITC: BUY

ITC’s cigarette business, which contributes about 80 percent to the company’s EBITDA, continues to be the cash cow. With reduced concerns about the core cigarette business and comforting valuation (discount vis-à-vis some of the large cap FMCG players), ITC is one of the best picks in the FMCG space.

Maruti Suzuki India: BUY

Maruti Suzuki India (Maruti) is India’s largest passenger vehicle (PV) manufacturer with a strong 47 percent market share. The ramp up of Gujarat capacity would enable Maruti to clock volume growth of 12.6 percent in FY2018 which is higher than the estimated industry growth of about 8-10%.

Maruti continues to remain our top bet in the automotive space given the sustained trend of outpacing the passenger vehicle industry growth and advise investors to accumulate the stock in event of price volatility.

Reliance Industries: BUY

Sharekhan expects Reliance Industries’ (RIL) GRM to remain strong at $10.9/11.7 per bbl in FY2018/FY2019 given the robust global oil demand growth outlook for 2017 at 1.3-1.4mbpd (International Energy Agency estimate).

The domestic brokerage firm expects EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 21%/9% over FY2017-FY2019E, driven by the commissioning of the core downstream projects in FY2018. Any positive surprise in terms of better-than-expected financials of the Telecom business would be an important re-rating trigger for RIL going forward.

Analyst: Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com

Mahindra and Mahindra: BUY

With robust products in the pipeline and strong marketing plan for recently launched products in SUV segment, the company is expected to regain the market share by 10 per cent.

The company also plans out to focus on exiting power brands to enhance market breath. It is expected to register volume growth in Tractor and UV segment on the backdrop demand increase from the rural segment.

ADF Foods: BUY

With stronger fundamental in terms of business model and niche product offering the company has consistently delivered a growth in terms of revenue generation.

With less debt on its balance sheet & increasing cash flow from operating activities, it is expected to expand its geographical presence across the rural & urban segment. The company is also a benefiter of the GST regime, monsoon and reviving rural expenditure.

Transport Corporation of India (TCI): BUY

TCI is one of the organized players in logistics segment and one of the sole benefactor by the changing tax regime. This changing regime will enhance the warehousing and supply chain management business with all sectors expected to route through a single pipeline.

Havells India: BUY

The recent acquisition of Lloyd business by Havell’s is expected to increase the consumer base in long term. Being a one of the pivot player in the electrical segment the company will expect to witness the volume growth coupled with increased revenue generation.

The company is also expected to witness revenue flow from its premium product offered to industry customer.

EID Parry: BUY

The Sugar industry witnessed a turnover in a recent development on import free duty which is expected to ease the price for domestic companies. EID Parry Ltd will be key recipient with low-cost materials.

With value addition and cost control, EID Parry reported a strong growth on bottom-line in last quarter. EID Parry is expected to continue with this trend improving macro fundamental.

Brokerage Firm: Edelweiss Financial Services

MCX: BUY

Q1FY18 marked another quarter of soft volumes post demonetisation for Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) – ADTV fell 24% YoY/3% QoQ to Rs188bn. However, better yield realisation of Rs2.24/lakh and controlled opex supported earnings.

Positively, post-GST implementation, some uptick in volumes was witnessed. With volumes being a key driver of earnings growth, there is a similar cut in earnings as well. Given structural volume growth visibility (though now deferred beyond FY18), operating leverage benefits and MCX’s entrenched leadership, we assign 36x earnings multiple giving us a fair value of Rs 1,310 for the stock.

However, the sharp correction in ITC capped Sensex gains.

The 30-share BSE Sensex was up 54.03 points at 32,074.78 and the 50-share NSE Nifty gained 29.60 points at 9,915.95 despite negative breadth.

Given the current market strength, bulls are not ready to give up easily and hence, it seems the Nifty is likely to touch 10,000 level soon, even though experts consistently saying valuations are stretched.

Sridhar Sivaram, Investment Director, Enam Holdings expects some challenges for the market in the short-term but he remains positive over the medium term.

According to him, earnings could recover in the second half of this year and next year as well due to GST (Goods and Services Tax) and interest rates transmission.

The broader markets underperformed benchmarks as the BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices closed flat. About 1,396 shares declined against 1,306 advancing shares on the exchange.

Wipro rallied 3 percent ahead of board meeting on July 20 to consider the proposal of share buyback.

Vedanta was up 2.7 percent after Motilal Oswal upgraded the stock to buy with a target price of Rs 311, citing oil & aluminium volumes and tight zinc supply.

Reliance Industries continued to gain for the 11th consecutive session, up 1.3 percent today, taking total gains to nearly 13 percent in 11 sessions. The rally helped the stock to cross market capitalisation of Rs 5 lakh crore and made it the most valuable company on the exchange.

Infosys rebounded 1.4 percent after Friday's late sell-off. Majority of global brokerage houses gave the company's earnings performance a thumbs up and believe that the company stood steady in challenging times.

ITC shares fell nearly 3 percent intraday Monday on fears of likely increase in cess on cigarettes.

Sources told CNBC-TV18 that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council is likely to meet today to consider a cess on tobacco.

The council is expected to discuss the impact on cigarette prices post GST rollout as the government already received representations from anti-tobacco lobbies on cigarette prices falling post GST.

It may also review the quantum of cess levied on cigarettes.

After GST rollout, the fall in total tax on tobacco products, which is dangerous to health, is worrisome for the government.

Hence, the Council called urgent meeting today ahead of its next scheduled meeting on August 5 as the decision on cess will be taken quickly,

After the rollout of GST, excise duty has automatically been removed on tobacco products. Now only GST and cess are levied on these products.

GST and cess combined on cigarettes is currently 6-8 percent lower than pre-GST regime.

According to Morgan Stanley, which increased target price on the stock to Rs 395 from Rs 310, the key risk would be sharp increase in cigarette tax in the next Budget (likely February 2018).

Last week CLSA, which has maintained buy rating on the stock, said in its report that ITC already announced a price cut of 1-2 percent on its key cigarette brands to pass on excise benefits to consumers.

At 11:26 hours IST, the stock price was quoting at Rs 328.55, down Rs 8.65, or 2.57 percent on the BSE."

ITC shares gained more than 3 percent intraday Thursday as research houses remained bullish on the stock, expecting it to gain up to 27 percent over a period of one year.

While retaining buy call with a target price of Rs 417, CLSA said channel checks indicated that ITC has cut cigarette prices for key brands by 1-2 percent in states with high VAT.

So, prices in states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, which had high VAT, are now down to the same level as those in Delhi (which had a lower VAT), signalling uniform pricing across India.

""On the face of it these appear to be cuts but we see these as mere adjustments as ITC is moving towards uniform prices for its brands,"" CLSA said.

The price revisions also signal that further cuts are less likely now, according to the research firm.

It feels no price cut would boost FY18 earnings but it will revisit earnings estimates post-Q1FY18 results given lack of clarity on GST rollout for the quarter ahead.

CLSA explained the difference of cigarette pricing before and after GST:

According to Citi, which also maintained buy rating on the stock with increased target price at Rs 380 (from Rs 355), ITC is a key holding in the consumer space. It trades at a discount of around 25-30 percent to the consumer staples sector.

""Legislative headwinds have receded and we forecast around 15 percent EBITDA CAGR over FY17-20 on volume growth and with capex of around Rs 3,000 crore per annum, free cash flow CAGR should be more than 20 percent. We think this should drive a re-rating of the stock,"" it explained.

Citi expects volumes to grow at 3.5-4 percent over the next 3 years, predicated on expectations of a more rational legislative regime.

FY17 saw cigarette volumes growing around 1.5 percent after a cumulative around 20 percent decline over 3 years.

Tobacco is relatively oligopolistic in most large Asian markets. ITC stands out with both solid market share, and with the top 3 brands accounting for 65 percent volume share.

Other than cigarette, the 2017 annual report provides plenty of color and food-for-thought. ITC's non cigarette FMCG business has crossed Rs 10,000 crore in revenues; around 75 percent of this is food & beverages, with strong market shares in noodles (No. 2 behind Nestle), biscuits (No. 3), confectionery (No. 2) and snacks (No. 2), Citi said.

Key risks, according to the research house, are 1) mix doesn’t improve as per expectations; and b) volume growth is softer than forecast.

ICICI Direct's research report on ITC

With the clarity emerging on new indirect tax rates on cigarettes, we believe net tax incidence on ITC would come down by 4. 5 % mainly due to elimination of cascading effect of taxes. Considering anti profiteering clause in place cigarettes price s are likely to come down by 2.5 %. After five consecutive year of increase in duties & taxes on cigarettes, GST implementation has come as advantage for cigarettes companies. We believe the company would continue to concentrate on low p riced (64 & 69 mm) cigarettes to derive higher volume growth. Notably 64 mm category volume contribution has increased from ~20% to ~32% in last one year. We have built in 4% volume growth for the FY18E and 5% price hikes as the company has increased price s earlier this year to the tune of 11 - 14% on above 69 mm portfolio. We remain positive on the stock and raise our target price to | 407 per share.

Outlook

We are factoring in 4.0% volume CAGR and 7.5% realisation CAGR in FY17 - 19E for the cigarette business. Additionally, ITC’s focus on growing its FMCG business (estimated to grow at a 12.3% CAGR over FY17 - 19E) by entering newer segments and tapping opportunity in foods segment would be a catalyst for top line growth in the long run. We reiterate our BUY recommendation on the stock with a target price of | 40 7 valuing it on SOTP basis. We have valued the cigarettes business at | 334 (higher multiple of 35 x FY19 EEPS given the lower tax incidence ), FMCG at | 44 (4x MCap/sales FY19E), paper boards at | 5 (3x FY19E EV/EBITDA), agri - business at | 5 (3x P/BV FY19E) and hotels at | 7 (2x EV/room FY19E) and also added the cash per share of | 12.For all recommendations report, click here

Indian market rallied by about 17 percent so far in the year 2017 and many stocks have actually more than doubled in the same period.

If you would have invested even at the start of 2017, you would still have your portfolio well in green. But, what should investors do now given the fact that many stocks are already trading near or above their long-term averages?

Morgan Stanley in its latest note on tactical ideas gives out a list of five names which they think could fall from current levels and some could well rise from here. Investors can make their decision based on their risk profile.

Tata Consultancy Services: Underweight| Fall in price with 70-80% probability

Morgan Stanley expects the share price of TCS will fall relative to the country index or Nifty50 over the next 60 days. The global investment bank expects a muted performance in 1Q18 for TCS.

Management commentary has been constructive around demand in FY18, but we see limited signs of a pickup in spending from 1Q itself, based on commentary/guidance of peers. It expects constant currency revenue growth in 1Q18 to be slower than it was last year (1Q17), though cross currency tailwinds will help reported US$ growth.

Morgan Stanley estimates that EBIT margin will decline 160bps on a QoQ basis, leading to muted net income performance. At 17.8x F18e P/E, it sees a risk to the downside.

“We estimate that there is about a 70% to 80% (or ""very likely"") probability for the scenario. Estimated probabilities are illustrative and assigned subjectively based on our assessment of the likelihood of the scenario,” said the report.

Wipro: Equal-Weight| Fall in price with 70-80% probability

Morgan Stanley believes that the share price will fall relative to the country index or Nifty over the next 60 days. “We expect Wipro's IT services revenue performance in 1Q18 to be weaker than that of peers. IT services revenue guidance was US$1,915-1,955mn (-2% QoQ to flat QoQ),” said the report.

Adjusting for cross currency movements, the guidance implies growth of -1.1 percent on a QoQ basis to over 0.9 percent on a QoQ. We expect US$ growth of -0.2% QoQ.

The two key areas of concern are 1) the healthcare vertical, which has yet to show a positive turnaround (per Accenture commentary) and 2) the retail vertical (which could surprise negatively for Indian IT vendors, as highlighted in our global CIO survey).

At 15x F18e P/E, the global investment bank sees risk to the downside. “We estimate that there is about a 70% to 80% (or ""very likely"") probability for the scenario,” it said.

Godrej Properties: Equal-Weight| Fall in price with 70-80% probability

Morgan Stanley believes that the share price will fall in absolute terms over the next 60 days. This is because the stock has traded up recently, making short-term valuation much less compelling.

Godrej Properties is up 76 percent on a YTD basis (vs. 11% for the Sensex) making valuations appear rich, especially on earnings, as the stock is trading at 30.3x F19 EPS of Rs15.7 (MSe) and a 7% discount to March '18 NAV of Rs558/share.

The stock seems to be pricing in the strong brand name, good execution capability seen in Trees residential, Vikhroli land bank and potential JDA opportunities.

Legacy projects are taking longer to monetize and the balance sheet appears stretched at 1.71x net gearing. “We estimate that there is about an 80 percent (or ""highly likely"") probability for the scenario,” said the report.

Titan Company: Overweight| Price to rise with 80% probability

Morgan Stanley believes that the share price will rise relative to the country index over the next 30 days. This is because of raised forecasts/guidance. “We see an opportunity for over 2x returns on Titan stock over the next three years,” it said.

Morgan Stanley forecasts an acceleration in revenue growth, led by rapid market share gains, ahead of market expectations, after implementation of GST.

Titan remains our top pick. In our base case, we factor in a 22 percent jewellery revenue CAGR in F2017-20 and a 27 percent earnings CAGR – the key driver of a 2x stock return over the next three years.

“We are 8-20 percent above consensus for F2018-20 earnings estimates. We estimate that there is about an over 80 percent (or ""highly likely"") probability for the scenario,” it said.

ITC: Overweight| Price to rise with 80% probability

Morgan Stanley believes that the share price will rise relative to the country index over the next 30 days. The government has issued a notification clarifying that there will be no levy of any additional duty of excise on cigarettes, although there is still no clarity on the levy of National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD).

With NCCD levied at the existing rate, our calculations suggest a ~4 percent reduction in cigarette taxes and ~2 percent price flexibility for ITC.

“Without NCCD, we see a higher 7 percent reduction in cigarette taxes and ~3.5 percent price flexibility. We expect the stock to react positively to this development as clarity emerges over NCCD in the next few days,” said the note.

“We estimate that there is about an 80%+ (or ""highly likely"") probability for the scenario,” it said.

The S&P BSE Sensex rallied over 300 points on a day which was expected to remain volatile largely weighed down by concerns over the implementation of the goods & services tax (GST).

The action was more visible in individual stocks as more than 100 stocks rose to their fresh 52-week high on the BSE and almost 27 stocks hit a fresh record high on Monday.

Stocks which rose to fresh 52-week high on the BSE include names like ITC, Lakshmi Machine Works, AB Nuvo, Venky’s, Avanti, V-Mart, D-Mart, Shantai Industries, Colgate Palmolive India, Tata Steel, PG Electroplast, Thomas Cook, Graphite India etc. among others.

Stocks hitting fresh record highs include names like Polson Ltd, VST Industries, VST Tillers, Venky’s, V-Mart, Yuken, Veljan Denision Ltd, Tokyo Plast International Ltd, HIL, Asian Granito India, Rasoi, Veljan Denison Ltd etc. among others.

Indian market closed on a muted note for the week ended 30 June ahead of the rollout of one nation one tax on Friday midnight. A smooth rollout of Goods and Service Tax (GST) will be the key event which everybody was eyeing this week.

But, since the implementation, it has been a smooth rollout and which is what gets reflected in market sentiment.

The rollout of GST has been positive and largely hassle-free, with no checks on state borders, smooth customs operations and no major problems reported, said a report quoting government officials.

The government is now looking at a massive outreach to consumers as well as industry to clarify all issues and highlight the benefits of the tax regime, which came into effect on July 1.

The stocks which led gains on the S&P BSE Sensex include names like ITC which rose as much as 9.6 percent on the BSE after the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), over the weekend, removed excise and additional excise duty on cigarettes, while the National Calamity Contingent continued to remain.

Brokerage houses largely see this move as a positive for the stock and see more upside for it. They believe that this could translate into better volume growth and give the company a window to roll out low-cost cigarette models and gain market share.

Following the smart rally in ITC, the S&P BSE FMCG index rose over 3 percent, followed by S&P BSE Telecom which gained 1.7 percent, and BSE Metal Index rose 1.3 percent today. On the other hand, the S&P BSE Healthcare and power indices slipped marginally.

Technical Take:

The Nifty made a small bullish candle on the daily candlestick charts after moving in a volatile range ahead of the rollout of GST on Friday. But, it managed to close above its crucial level of 9,500 which was a positive sign.

For the index to gain momentum, a close above 9,650 could take the index well above 9,700.

But, the relative strength index (RSI) of Nifty currently stands at 43 which indicates a negative trend as Nifty started to trade below its support level.

“The sideways movement in upcoming session can’t be ruled given the confusion over the growth projection out of GST regime followed by aggressive stance by regulators on bad loans signalling a volatile ride,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder & CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“However, if Nifty breaks past from its higher resistance level placed at 9,700, any breakout will give an upward momentum which could take the index towards 9,850-9,900 in the medium period,” he said."

Dinesh Rohira 5nance.com

The Nifty continued with the downward spiral in its daily chart for the third week in a row, indicating a slothful movement in an upcoming session.

Despite closing on a positive bias in Friday’s trade, Nifty failed to cohere above its psychological support level during the closing period of trade on the backdrop of selling pressure coupled with mounting concerns over NPA resolutions and GST implementation.

On the daily chart, Nifty formed a bullish candlestick pattern. A downward breakout from this crucial support level of 9,450 may drag Nifty at 9390 level.

However, if Nifty breaks past from its higher resistance level placed at 9,700, any breakout will give an upward momentum which could take the index towards 9,850-9,900 in the medium period.

The relative strength index (RSI) of Nifty currently stands at 43 which indicates a negative trend as Nifty started to trade below its support level. On the basis of EMA, the broad range for the week is seen from 9,350 on downside and 9,750 on the upside.

The sideways movement in upcoming session can’t be ruled given the confusion over the growth projection out of GST regime followed by aggressive stance by regulators on bad loans signalling a volatile ride.

Here is a list of top five stocks which can give up to 18% return in short term:

Bharat Gears Ltd: BUY| Target Rs165 | Stop Loss Rs130| Return 18%

Regardless of trading in a sideways direction for several trading periods, Bharat Gears has withheld with their upper circuit while limiting the downward breakout on the backdrop of volume support.

The inherent breakout from upper level is expected by a build up of a strong uptrend momentum which could take the index above Rs160 level.

We have a BUY recommendation for Bharat Gears which is currently trading at Rs139.20, with a target placed at Rs165 and a stop loss of Rs130.

Rain Industries Ltd: BUY| Target Rs135 | Stop-loss Rs105 | Return 16%

Further, the EMA and SMA indicates a weaker position, as the price started trading below its moving average price. The stock will be tested at the upper resistance level of 1435, while the support level will be seen at 1352.

Given the outlook of stock based on technical, it can’t be ruled out that the stock will witness a further breakout from its next support level.

ITC gained over 9 percent intraday on Monday post developments around taxation on cigarettes.

The Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), over the weekend, removed excise and additional excise duty on cigarettes, while the National Calamity Contingent continued to remain.

Brokerage houses largely see this move as a positive for the stock and see more upside for it. They believe that this could translate into better volume growth and give the company a window to roll out low cost cigarette models and gain market share.

Moneycontrol takes a look at what major global brokerages are talking about the stock.

Brokerage: Bank of America Merrill Lynch | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 390

The global financial services firm highlighted the development of Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) removing excise and additional excise duty on cigarettes, while National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) stayed. The firm believes that this development could result in lower tax incidence on cigarettes by 6 percent. Meanwhile, bidis will face rise in taxes and hence there could be more working capital needs and compliance cost. Further, BofA-ML sees potential for 50 percent price hikes by the company based on channel checks.

Brokerage: Credit Suisse | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 400

The brokerage firm sees ITC getting back to high teens earnings trajectory as tailwind on the back of GST is confirmed. It expects FY18 cigarette sales to grow over 15 percent with 8-10 percent increase in realisations from GST. It also foresees operating estimates increasing 5-6 percent, while earnings CAGR moves from 14 percent to over 17 percent.

Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 310

Morgan Stanley said that its calculations suggest that there could be an over 4 percent reduction in cigarette taxes and offer 2 percent price flexibility for the company. Having said that, the tax incidence on the supply chain under GST would rise. It sees the stock to react positively based on the taxation development.

Brokerage: Deutsche Bank | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 390

Deutsche Bank expects the stock to rally in the near term as uncertainty around taxes in transition to GST is over now. This predictability could now drive volume growth and better mix management, the research firm wrote in its report. Further, it said that an opportunity to launch lower-priced cigarette could drive growth in the organised sector.

Brokerage: Macquarie | Rating: Outperform | Target: Rs 385

Macquarie has increased FY18/19 earnings by 5 percent. The company is the top pick in the Indian consumer sector for the research firm. In fact, it is a Macquarie marquee recommended stock.

Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 417

CLSA too said that the tax reduction was a positive sign for the company. Having said that, anti-profiteering rules could apply and that the company will have to cut cigarette prices.

Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Overweight | Target: Rs 350

Post the tax reduction, the research firm sees upside risks to cigarette EBIT growth.

The stock gained over 12 percent in the past one month, while its three-day gain stood at 14 percent. At 09:15 hrs ITC was quoting at Rs 349.80, up Rs 25.95, or 8.01 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week high of Rs 352.65."

ITC shares touched a record high of Rs 323.80, up 4 percent intraday Friday as CLSA retained its buy call on the stock with a target price of Rs 375, citing likely neutral GST outcome.

""With GST set to roll-out from July 1, there still is uncertainty on rates for tobacco; our calculation suggests a decline assuming additional duty surcharge (ADS) is not charged on top of GST & cess. We, however, model in a neutral outcome which itself would drive double-digit earnings growth after two years,"" the research house reasoned.

ITC's FY17 operating cash flow grew 9 percent YoY which was similar to net earnings growth. Core working capital declined 10 days YoY, mainly due to lower inventory days. Capex rose 36 percent YoY, off a low base and free cash flow stayed flat YoY at Rs 9.2 per share.

Over FY17-20, CLSA expects ITC to generate free cash flow at 14 percent CAGR over FY17-20, as it expects strong earnings growth along with modest rise in capex.

Another Tryst With Destiny! How GST Will Change Your Life After July 1

ITC's return on equity was almost flat at 23.5 percent which came as a relief due to a declining trend in the past few years. Cigarette return on capital employed rose to a record high of 231 percent while agri was strong and paperboard was at respectable levels.

FMCG failed to contribute due to macro issues and drag from launches while hotels continued to destroy value, a trend for eight years in a row.

""Despite its 15-year journey, enviable brands and strong position in several categories, profits continue to be elusive - we believe focus should shift on profitability and this may require taking a hard look at the portfolio,"" CLSA said.

Despite an increase in overall revenues, ITC managed to keep costs under check. Advertising and promotion spends notably declined 9 percent, partially due to demonetisation, according to the research house.

In several of the heads, viz, traveling, IT services, warehousing, freight, etc, there was a decline or a marginal increase, YoY. Segmentally, cigarettes EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) growth was a modest 6.5 percent with a slight decline in costs.

At 15:00 hours IST, the stock price was quoting at Rs 323.35, up Rs 11.95, or 3.84 percent on the BSE.

Geojit Financial Services recommends the following stocks:

JK Lakshmi Cement Ltd Rating: Buy CMP: Rs491

JK Lakshmi Cement (JKLC) is a part of JK group mainly focused in north, west and eastern regions of India with a consolidated capacity of 12.5 MT as on FY17 and is one of the most cost-efficient players.

The company has completed its major capex of Rs 3,000 crore as on FY17 and the balance sheet is likely to improve going forward due to improvement in cash flow. We expect D/E to improve to 1.3x from current 1.6x. Cost efficiency is likely to improve due to commissioning of 100 percent captive power and Conveyor Belt at its East plant. We expect EBITDA margin is likely to improve from the current 12.6 percent to 15.2 percent by FY19 and PAT is expected to grow at 56 percent CAGR over FY17-19.

Bharat Electronics Ltd Rating: Buy CMP: Rs 166

Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) is a Navaratna enterprise having 37 percent market share in Indian Defence Electronics. BEL’s core capabilities are in radar & weapons systems, defence communication & electronic warfare.

BEL will emerge as key beneficiary from on-going defence modernisation programmes & GoI focus on indigenisation. Order inflow in Q4FY17 grew by 172 percent YoY to Rs 10,000 crore. The current order backlog of Rs 40,000 crore is 5.3x FY17 sales, which has significantly improved the earnings outlook. We factor order book to grow at 15 percent CAGR, consequently earnings is expected to grow by 14 percent CAGR over FY17-FY19E. We value BEL at P/E of 22x on FY19E on improved order inflow outlook.

ITC Ltd Rating: Buy CMP: Rs311

ITC is a diversified conglomerate, present across categories– cigarettes, other FMCG, hotels, paper & agri-business. ITC is a market leader in the cigarettes category with volume market share of ~75 percent.

Given its leadership position in cigarette category, continuous investment behind brand building & innovations in other FMCG business, we maintain positive stance on the stock. Cigarettes business (which contributes ~50 percent to revenues) registered a growth of 4.8 percent YoY in Q4FY17 led by realisation growth on account of price hikes undertaken by ITC post excise hike. Notably, the neutral GST rate for this category augurs well for volume growth & hence, we expect this segment to grow at revenue CAGR of ~8.7 percent over FY17-19E.

The Nifty reclaimed its crucial psychological level of 9600 on Monday and is on track to hit its next crucial level of 9,700. However, technical chartists see further consolidation ahead for the index and it would not be that easy to break above 9,700 in a hurry.

The market has tapered off from fresh all-time highs hit last month but it managed to take support above its crucial support level of 9550. Now, a break above 9,650 would strengthen the bullish argument till that time the index is likely to trade in a range.

“Candlestick analysis shows a mixed bag of a picture and the index is likely to trade in a broad range of 9,450 - 9,750 for next few weeks,” Pushkaraj Kanitkar - AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital told Moneycontrol.

“Even though the index is expected to trade in a range, individual stocks are likely to remain in action and one should continue having a stock specific approach,” he said.

Based on technical charts we have collated stock picks from various experts which can give up to 18 percent return in next 5-8 weeks:

Analyst: Pushkaraj Kanitkar - AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital

Century Textiles: BUY| Target Rs1150| Stop Loss Rs 1079| Return 3%

In spite of the overall sombre nature of the markets, the scrip has outperformed over last few days with prices crossing onto 3-week high.

The delivered quantity has seen a good jump in last few days. These quantities stand between 1.5-1.75 times of the average delivered volumes, indicating a genuine buying interest in the scrip.

The delivered quantity vis-a-vis total volume is at the highest in the recent past, with delivered percentage rising higher (64% vs average of 52%).

The said rise in delivery is accompanied by a huge drop in the Open Interest (OI) indicating lightening of positions. A contra-trend buy one may target the 50-DMA placed at Rs346 followed by the convergence of the 100-DMA placed at Rs385 mark.

The calendar year has seen multiple failures from the 200-210 levels which also correspond to the long term top created in July 2014 placed at Rs200 levels. The weekly candlestick pattern has given rise to an Engulfing Bear candle.

It is time to be stock specific, maybe that’s the approach mutual fund managers are taking right now at a time when the market trades near record highs. The Nifty50 which has come off slightly from its record high but has gained over 17 percent so far in the year 2017.

Fund managers remained selective when they shopped for stocks in the month of May. They remained net buyers in 65 percent of the Nifty50 stocks, Motilal Oswal said in a report.

Stocks in which funds have more than 2 percent stake include names like Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Power Grid, Infosys, TCS, L&T, State Bank of India, ITC, M&M, ICICI Bank, Eicher Motors etc. among others.

Among the Nifty50 names, highest net buying in the month of May on a month-on-month (MoM) basis was witnessed in Vedanta (up 27 percent), Kotak Mahindra Bank (up 17 percent) and Tech Mahindra (up 17 percent).

The Equity asset under management (AUM) rose for the sixth consecutive month in May to scale a new high of Rs 5.2 trillion, highlighted the report.

In the month of May, MFs showed interest in private banks, metals, consumer, technology, auto and infrastructure — these sectors saw a MoM increase in weights.

Among the Nifty50 names, top conviction buys include names like HDFC Bank where almost 19 funds have more than 2 percent exposure, followed by ICICI Bank with 16 funds having an exposure of 2 percent and 12 funds have exposure to State Bank of India.

Almost 5 funds have exposure in both Kotak Mahindra Bank and HDFC while 4 funds have exposure in Yes Bank and 3 funds have holdings in Axis Bank.

Rate sensitive stocks have been fund managers’ darling in the last few months especially private sector banks. Private Banks sectoral weight rose 17.3 percent which as the top sector holding in May, followed by Auto (10.7 percent), Capital Goods (8.7 percent) and NBFC (7 percent).

“Since banks are a play on the economy, they can sustain earnings growth for a long time. Particularly, ICICI Bank is attractively valued while HDFC and Kotak are high-quality stocks that have a track record of delivering superior returns,” Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

Among the IT or technology sector names Infosys remained in the spotlight. Despite global headwinds which have contracted margin for some of the top IT companies, almost 11 funds have holdings of more than 2 percent in Infosys while for TCS it is just 1 fund.

Mutual funds are betting on stocks which have good earnings visibility are stocks from sectors like IT and pharma which are facing some headwinds are valued very low.

Some quality names in both these segments are available at attractive valuations which are attracting smart money into these stocks.

“Clarity from Managements of IT majors on underperformance has helped to rope in some Bargain Hunters into the sector,” Rajesh Shanbhag, Advisory Head – Alternate Channels, Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“However, Indian Prime Minister’s meet with US President which is scheduled for this month-end will be closely watched where the H1 B VISA issue is to be addressed,” he said."

The country's second-largest software services firm, Infosys, today announced the appointment of former Wipro executive Inderpreet Sawhney as its group general counsel.

The appointment is effective July 3, 2017, Infosys said in a statement. Prior to Wipro, she has served as managing partner of a mid-sized law firm in Silicon Valley and has also worked with ITC Ltd as the in-house counsel.

She replaces Gopi Krishnan Radhakrishnan -- the acting general counsel of Infosys -- who will be leaving the company later this month to pursue other opportunities. Another key executive, Sandeep Dadlani, who was serving as president and head of manufacturing, retail, CPG and logistics, has also put in his papers.

His role is now being split with Karmesh Vaswani taking over as the global head for retail, CPG and logistics (RCL) while Nitesh Banga will head manufacturing from July 15. Both Vaswani and Banga have held strategic portfolios across the company for nearly a decade.

On the appointment, Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka said Inderpreet has a strong and diverse global experience over a career spanning over 24 years, and her expertise will be integral to the ""transformation journey"" that Infosys has embarked on.

""I have worked closely with them (Vaswani and Banga) over the last three years and have tremendous faith in their passion for client success and their ability to help clients see and achieve their digital aspirations,"" he added. In December last year, Infosys had said it had ""mutually agreed"" to cease the employment of the then general counsel, David Kennedy.

He was also to receive severance payments, a move that did not go down well with some of the founders, including N R Narayana Murthy, who questioned why such a payment was being made. Infosys clarified that the severance pay was part of the employment agreement Kennedy had signed when he had joined the firm in November 2014. Kennedy was the second Infosys executive after former CFO Rajiv Bansal to be paid a severance package."

“In the case of HDFC, MFs would have added positions due to the whole sector coming under the limelight in May 2017. Among other sectors, MFs bought Shares of metal companies like Tata Steel, Vedanta, JSW Steel, Hind Zinc and Hindalco as the outlook on these companies improved,” he said.

The AUM of Equity Fund increased by 2.7 percent or Rs 13,394 crore to Rs 5.18 lakh crore for the month of May 2017 over April 2017, IDBI Capital said in a report.

On a month-on-month (MoM) basis, the weights of private banks, metals, consumer, technology, auto and infrastructure increased, while those of healthcare, oil & gas, PSU Banks, cement, capital goods and utilities showed signs of moderation.

ICICI Bank, one of the preferred stocks among MFs in May, saw net buying by 10 funds. The value increased by Rs42.4b and the stock gained 17 percent for the month.

“Since banks are a play on the economy, they can sustain earnings growth for a long time. Particularly, ICICI Bank is attractively valued while HDFC and Kotak are high-quality stocks that have a track record of delivering superior returns,” Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“Expectation of rate cut is one factor, but that has already been factored in. In 2017 only one cut of 25bp can be expected,” he said.

There was good buying seen by MFs in the midcaps space. Fund managers increased their stake in Apollo Hospitals, Dabur India, Voltas, Hindalco, Power Grid etc. among others.

Vedanta, which entered the Nifty-50, was also one of the preferred stocks among MFs in May, with net buying by 14 funds. In the auto space, MF increased their stake in Tata Motors, and Hero Motocorp.

“The recent actions from States on Farm Loan Waivers shows Government's clear focus on rural India growth, the same was visible in the Financial Budget. This should help in rural demand for Autos and Two wheelers which got a setback post demonetisation,” Rajesh Shanbhag, Advisory Head – Alternate Channels, Way2Wealth Brokers Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Further good monsoon favouring India should also add icing on the cake for the sector,” he said.

There was some value buying seen in technology space as fund managers lapped up Infosys as well as TCS in the month of May.

“Stocks having good earnings visibility are very highly valued while stocks in industries like IT and pharma which are facing some headwinds are valued very low,” said Vijayakumar of Geojit Financial Services.

“Some quality names in both these segments are available at attractive valuations. There is the high margin of safety in these stocks at the present valuations,” he said."

While ITC’s gross sales grew by mere 6% YoY in Q4FY17, net sales grew by healthy 14% YoY driven by 11% drop in excise duty outgo this quarter. Notably, the base quarter witnessed higher excise as inventory rose in the system ahead of pictorial warning implementation.

Outlook

Further, revenue/PAT is expected to witness a CAGR of 13.6%/15.4% over FY17-19E. The neutral GST rate for cigarette augurs well for volume growth of the category & hence, we upgrade our rating from ‘HOLD’ to ‘BUY’ with a revised TP of Rs 336 (earlier Rs 291) based on 30x FY19E P/E.

Four of the 10 most valued Indian companies witnessed a combined erosion of Rs 36,771.7 crore from their market valuation last week, with ITC and TCS taking the biggest knock.

While TCS, ITC, Infosys and ONGC suffered losses, RIL, HDFC Bank, HDFC, HUL, SBI and Maruti saw rise in their market capitalisation (m-cap) for the week ended Friday.

The cumulative gain of these companies, which stood at Rs 29,857.7 crore, was less than the total loss suffered by the four firms.

ITC's valuation plummeted by Rs 15,730.86 crore to Rs 3,71,952.87 crore, emerging as the worst hit among the top-10 entities.

The m-cap of TCS slumped by Rs 10,167.41 crore to Rs 4,94,626.67 crore and that of ONGC dived Rs 6,095.79 crore to Rs 2,17,074.17 crore.

Also, Infosys saw its valuation decline by Rs 4,777.64 crore to Rs 2,17,899.66 crore.

From the gainers, Maruti stole the show as its m-cap surged Rs 10,172.54 crore to Rs 2,25,079.85 crore.

HDFC Bank's valuation jumped Rs 7,989.03 crore to Rs 4,28,196.33 crore and that of HDFC rose by Rs 5,523.07 crore to Rs 2,61,427.88 crore.

RIL added Rs 3,495.3 crore to Rs 4,34,229.09 crore in its m-cap and HUL gained Rs 1,785.68 crore at Rs 2,37,051.88 crore.

The valuation of SBI went up by Rs 892.08 crore to Rs 2,33,969.38 crore.

In the ranking of top-10 firms, TCS maintained the numero-uno position followed by RIL, HDFC Bank, ITC, HDFC, HUL, SBI, Maruti, Infosys and ONGC.

Maruti Suzuki had zipped past Infosys and ONGC in m-cap ranking on Friday.

Both the BSE and NSE indices recorded their first weekly fall in five weeks by losing 11.23 points, or 0.03 per cent and 14.75 points, or 0.15 per cent, respectively.

The Finance Ministry is considering to divest stake in tobacco companies, sources privy to the development have told news wire agency Cogencis.

This move comes after the Health Ministry raised concerns over the exposure of government stake in tobacco companies, sources say.

Earlier this year the government divested 2 percent of its stake held in ITC through the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI).

But this divestment had only one buyer, the Life Insurance Corporation of India, which picked up the entire 2 percent stake in ITC.

This move received much criticism, as many termed LIC picking up stake in a cigarette company morally wrong. Experts chose not to term this transfer of shares from the centre to one of its own arm as a divestment.

Speaking to Moneycontrol, JN Gupta, Co-founder and MD of proxy advisory firm Stakeholders Empowerment Services (SES) had said that in the real sense, ""one arm of the government is the seller and other is the buyer, so at best it a resource [mobilisation] exercise by the government.""

""The money that has been put in [by LIC to buy 2 percent in ITC] does not belong to the government but to the policyholders,"" he said.

It remains to be seen whether such a transfer of resources will again be effected by the government.

LIC already has 16.29 percent stake in ITC, which is anyway a violation of the maximum holding norms laid down by insurance industry regulator IRDAI.

IRDAI allows insurers to hold only up to 15 percent stake in one company.

While it is unlikely that India's biggest life insurer will buy further stake in ITC, given its affinity for the stock, it may not come as a surprise.

LIC Chairman sidestepped a question on why the insurer's stake in the company exceeds the threshold, only saying that ""these are strategic investments for us.""

In the past, the government's holding has protected ITC from hostile takeovers. It is this stake that kept British American Tobacco from acquiring a majority stake in the company.

A question of morals

Directly or indirectly, the government holds a significant stake in ITC. Through the SUUTI fund and state-owned insurance companies, the state has 30.25 percent share in the company as of March 31, 2017.

Multi-business conglomerate, ITC, has now forayed into the frozen foods market with the launch of frozen prawns under the ITC MasterChef brand created earlier in the year to roll out export quality spices. The frozen prawns market, currently dominated by brands like IFB, Sumeru, Cambay Tiger, among others, is estimated to be worth Rs 300-crore.

Starting with New Delhi and Hyderabad, ITC plans to sell its frozen prawns in seven metro cities covering 200 top retail outlets in each city, by year-end. The 200-gram packs are priced between Rs 185 and Rs 350 and they will also be sold on online like BigBasket. The company even plans to take care of the delivery if required.

As part of its strategy to enter one new category every quarter, the salt-to-cigarette company next plans to launch vegetable and fruits later this year before moving on to sauces, dips and condiments. However, ITC may consider creating a new brand for fresh vegetables, fruits and organic products. The ITC MasterChef brand will cover only processed and frozen foods.

The idea behind the launch of the range of products is to garner as much shelf space in Indian kitchens as possible, S Sivakumar, Group Head (agri and IT business) at ITC told Mint. “If a kitchen has all ITC products, we’ll have about two-thirds of the (shelf) space in a kitchen. And, there’s huge scope untapped,” he said.

“We have a pipeline ready. From low-sugar potato to dehydrated onions to processed mango pulp that are ‘super safe’. The next could be some high value-added ready-to-cook options, developed with ITC Hotels, under ITC MasterChef,” Sivakumar said.

The company has lined up investments of over Rs 25,000 crore for 65 projects, including 25 factories for packaged foods. The capex will help it achieve the target of Rs 1 lakh crore in revenue by 2030 from cigarettes and consumer packaged foods business.

ICICI Direct's research report on ITC

ITC reported revenue growth of 6.1% YoY to Rs 14882.8 crore, largely in line with our estimate of Rs 14574.1 crore. Cigarette grew 4.8% YoY, FMCG, agri & hotel segments grew 6.5% YoY each. Paperboards, paper and packaging segment grew 4.4% YoY.

Outlook

Additionally, ITC’s focus on growing its FMCG business by entering newer segments and tapping opportunity in foods segment would be a catalyst for topline growth in the long run. We maintain our BUY recommendation on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 345.

Edelweiss' research report on ITC

ITC’s Q4FY17 revenue, EBITDA and PAT growth of 14.0%, 7.5% and 12.1% YoY, respectively, came in line with estimate driven by flattish cigarette volumes (slightly ahead of our 1‐2% YoY dip estimate). Fifth consecutive quarter of non‐negative cigarette volume growth and no negative surprise in GST rate reaffirms our confidence of sustenance of cigarette volumes.

Outlook

With per capita consumption 1/18th China’s, cigarette opportunity in India remains attractive. Though illegal cigarettes are a big menace (one‐fifth of overall cigarette industry in India), GST implementation will mitigate the impact. We maintain ‘BUY/SO’ with target price of INR 370.

ITC continued its winning streak post Q4 results as the stock rallied as much as 3.6 percent in morning trade on Monday to hit its fresh record high of Rs 319.85.

Nomura maintained its buy rating on ITC but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 356 from Rs 299 earlier which translates into an upside of 15 percent from current levels.

ITC reported a decent set of numbers for the quarter ended March. The revenue growth of 14 percent was led by cigarette revenue growth of 4.8 percent on flattish volumes (estimated) as the company recovers post demonetization.

Diversified firm ITC reported 12.13 percent increase in standalone net profit to Rs 2,669.47 crore for the fourth quarter of 2016-17 last week. The company had posted a net profit of Rs 2,380.68 crore for the January-March quarter of last fiscal, ITC said in a BSE filing.

ITC's net sales during the period under review were up 6.15 percent to Rs 15,008.82 crore as against Rs 14,138.78 crore for the corresponding quarter last fiscal.

The cigarettes business registered strong EBIT growth of 8 percent, indicating the effects of the recent price hikes taken along with changed mix. “Cigarettes will continue to drive profits for the company in the medium term,” said the report.

“We incorporate the FY17 results, the recent price hike taken by the company and GST rate announcement into our estimates and increase our FY19F estimates by 2.8 percent. With the regulatory overhangs on the cigarettes business reducing, we raise our target price to Rs356, largely due to a change in the valuation multiple,” said the Nomura report.

Post the announcement of GST rates last week, the global investment bank believes that a re-rating is likely for ITC, driven by -- a) the overall tax incidence has been retained, and no additional tax burden has been imposed on the industry, b) the cascading tax burden currently on the company has now been removed, and c) the continued fear of states individually changing taxes each year, apart from excise duty increases, has now been substantially reduced."

ITC reported 12.1 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in standalone net profit to Rs 2669 crore for the quarter ended March 31, which was slightly better than the CNBC-TV18 estimate of Rs 2,653 crore.

ITC, a multi-business conglomerate, reported a net profit of Rs 2380.68 crore in the corresponding quarter of last fiscal, ITC said in a statement.

ITC rose 4.5 percent to hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs313.80.

Total revenues increased by 6 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 15,008.62 crore for the quarter ended March 31, which was slightly lower than a CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 15066 crore. ITC reported total revenue of Rs 14,138.78 crore in the year-ago period.

The cigarette volume increased by 4.8 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 8,954.94 crore for the quarter ended March 31, compared to Rs 8545.46 crore reported in a corresponding quarter of last fiscal.

The board also recommended a dividend of Rs 4.75 per Ordinary Share of Re 1 each for the financial year ended 31st March 2017, subject to declaration of the same by the Members at the 106th Annual General Meeting of the Company convened for Friday, 28th July 2017.

Mutual fund managers have been paring stake in some of the consumer discretionary stocks in the last few days particularly post the announcement of GST or Goods and Services Tax rates, according to the institutional brokers.

Among the stocks that fund houses are offloading are Havells India, Kajaria Ceramics, Symphony, V-Guard Industries, and Somani Cements Company, among others, brokers said.

“Valuation wise mutual funds are not too comfortable buying these consumer discretionary stocks,” a broker from a well-known brokerage house said.

“Additionally, GST for consumption sector is 28 percent which is not in line with industry estimates according to some companies and with this rate, difference between unorganised and organised stands almost 38 percent. So, there is no encouragement on part of unorganised players to come into the system,” the broker quoted above added.

India Ratings, in a report, said the transition to GST will disrupt the working capital cycle of businesses in the initial phase and thus, easy liquidity in the system is essential for two to four months.

The implementation of GST may cause a shift in market shares leading to expansion of organised sectors in FY18 at the cost of unorganised sectors, according to ratings agency ICRA.

In its report, ICRA said the introduction of the GST is likely to reduce competitiveness of the unorganised sector. It said several short-term implementation challenges remain, which may increase compliance costs and raise working capital requirement for companies.

Although tax rates on goods will now be common across states, which would reduce the compliance burden for businesses, the multiplicity of slabs for goods and services suggests the tax structure would remain complex.

All capital goods and all industrial intermediaries will attract 18 percent tax instead of 28 percent. On the other hand, a few segments in the consumer durables will see a higher effective taxes and need to take price hikes to offset cost pressures from increased taxes. The GST Council has put items like refrigerators and ACs in the maximum 28 percent category.

""GST is a game changing reform that is widely awaited. It has the potential of adding almost 100bps to the GDP growth. Though the near term will see some challenges of implementation, It is one reform that will bring efficiency in the economy and widen the tax base."" Sunil Singhania, Chief Investment Officer- Equity Investment, Reliance Mutual Fund.

Meanwhile, mutual funds have been picking up shares of FMCG such as HUL, Marico, ITC, Colgate Palmolive, Dabur, among others.

“We believe that the FMCG sector stands to benefit from the reduction in tax rates for soaps, toothpastes and adhesives to 18% from 22-26% currently. Similarly, indirect tax levy on lubricants has been lowered to 18% from 27-28%. We believe that companies might either pass on the benefit of lower duties to consumers to spur demand or retain it to derive margin benefits. Indirect tax levies have been broadly maintained for cigarettes, which, in our view, could auger well for the sector,” Motilal Oswal Securities said in its report on GST.

The Goods and Services tax or GST Council finalised the rate structure for most goods and services along with the GST compensation cess for various products.

In the GST rate schedule nearly 81 percent of items are in the 18 percent tax bracket or below and the remaining 19 percent at the highest 28 percent tax slab.

According to brokerage houses, broadly, the tax rate is neutral to positive for most FMCG sectors.

A report from Nirmal Bang-Institutional Equities states the current incidence of indirect tax on most FMCG items is in the range of 20-24 percent and, therefore, the proposal to tax some of the commonly used products such as soaps, hairoil and toothpaste at 18 percent is positive.

The tax proposals, to some extent, were consensus and, therefore, there is no major positive surprise for the Street.

According to brokers, in the last few days buying is also witnessed in Voltas, State Bank of Bank, GAIL, Reliance Industries, NIIT Ltd, among others."

The market witnessed gap-up opening on Monday’s trading session but traded gradually sideways to downside throughout the entire session leaving some more room for downside pressure on Tuesday.

The market is facing some consolidation on the higher levels and will likely build up some selling pressure for the near future. Although, 20-days moving average (DMA) is still supporting the market but MACD has generated fresh selling signals on the daily charts that might remain intact in the coming session and bring some downside movement.

The Nifty is likely to touch lower levels near 9,400-9,390 in the next trading session where a close below could prove even worse for the near term.

Here is a list of top five stocks which are likely to give up to 4% return this week:

ICICI Bank: SELL| Target Rs292| Stop Loss Rs310| Return 3%

The stock has seen severe selling pressure during the Monday’s session and we expect some more downside in the coming session. The counter has breached four sessions low and even managed to close below four session’s lowest level.

The momentum indicators are hinting towards more downside as the relative strength index (RSI) has shown fresh breakdown along with MACD which has started moving down.

Tata Motors: BUY| Target Rs465| Stop Loss Rs442| Return 3.5%

The stock gained momentum during Monday’s session followed by a positive daily closing, supported by 20-DMA and slightly higher volumes. The momentum indicators are moving upwards suggesting some more northwards movement to remain intact in the coming session up to the higher levels of Rs462 and even more.

ITC: BUY| Target Rs315| Stop Loss Rs296| Return 3.9%

The stock witnessed a gap-up opening and maintained its upside strength throughout the entire session closing with the gains slightly more than 6 percent for intraday.

The counter closed with a fresh upside breakout on the higher side with high volumes as it is managed to close above its breakout level of Rs290 on Monday. The stock is likely to touch upper levels near Rs315-320 as the daily chart suggests 5-6 percent more upside to see over the short-term.

The tax proposals, to some extent, were consensus and, therefore, there is no major positive surprise for the Street.

Also, many companies enjoy excise duty exemption and those details are still sketchy as to what exemptions will be available under GST.

The GST will be positive for Colgate Palmolive and Dabur India and will be neutral to negative for cigarette manufacturers and other FMCG companies for an additional 5 percent cess on cigarettes and increase in incidence of indirect tax from 18-24 percent to 28 percent for other personal products-- ITC , Hindustan Unilever , Godrej Consumer, Marico, Emami, Gillette.

A research report from JPMorgan states that GST will have a positive impact on soaps, toothpaste, hair oil, adhesives, coal, large cars, SUVs while cigarettes, cement, white goods, formulations, small cars, two-wheelers, and tractors the impact will be neutral.

The items that will have to bear the brunt of higher GST rate are paints, skin creams, shampoos, laundry, switches, and three-wheelers.

Among FMCG companies, Colgate India is a beneficiary with lower tax for toothpaste, while the paints segment has seen a marginal tax increase.

Cigarette cess has been broadly in line with excise duty. A small ad valorem component has been included. Cigarettes will attract a GST rate of 28 percent plus cess. The cess has been finalized now at 5 percent plus specific rate.

The cess is broadly similar to the current excise structure, though we note an ad valorem component will imply tax rises with prices.

GST rate for skin creams, shampoos and laundry is higher at 28 percent. Packaged juices, noodles and chocolates have GST rates of 12 percent, 18 percent and 28 percent, respectively. The GST rate on biscuits is yet to be firmed up.

Most companies have stated that they will pass on the net benefits/adverse impact from taxes to consumers.

A research report from Motilal Oswal Financial Services, stated that the impact on margins will hinge upon pricing strategies being adopted by the companies in coming weeks post GST implementation.

With the implementation of GST, many companies in the FMCG sector will likely gain as a result of the potential shift from the unorganised segment to the organised segment."

The tax rate announcements by the GST Council on Friday led to two stocks react in diverse manner.

While one FMCG major hit a record high figure intraday on Monday, a multiplex chain had a freefall as the tax rates have come in higher than expected.

ITC had witnessed months of pain on the back of an uncertainty in the GST tax rates on cigarettes. However, with the tax slabs fixed in the range of 5-28 percent, coupled with a cess cap of 15 percent, taxation on cigarettes are set to be lower. This boosted the stock performance which rose 5 percent and clocked its record high.

“If our hypothesis of a fall in cigarette tax is correct, we could see another leg of sharp re-rating (ITC trades at a 35% discount to HUL on F19e earnings) that would bring the stock closer to our bull case value (representing 59% upside from current levels),” Morgan Stanley said in a report.

Meanwhile, PVR took a hit of 8 percent intraday on the back of a higher-than expected GST rate of 28 percent. The industry was working with an expectation of 18 percent GST rate.

ITC has gained over 6 percent in the past one month, while its three-day gain was 5.04 percent. At 10:36 hrs, ITC was quoting at Rs 296.05, up Rs 10.15, or 3.55 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week high of Rs 299.90.

Simultaneously, PVR lost around 6 percent in the past one month, while its three-day loss stood at 5 percent. At 10:36 hrs, PVR was quoting at Rs 1,461.00, down Rs 58.20, or 3.83 percent on the BSE. It touched an intraday high of Rs 1,512.80 and an intraday low of Rs 1,400.10."

Reliance Securities recommends the following stocks:

VEDANTA

CMP: 230| RECO: BUY| TARGET: 263| STOP LOSS: 215

Vedanta reversed after taking support of its 50 percent and 61.8 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior up-move (Rs 191-263) from last three instances, which is signaling that limited downside is left in the stock.

As per the current daily set-up, we believe that stock will soon resume its uptrend and revisit prior swing high, which is placed around Rs 263.

In case of any negative surprise, the stock will find support around its key Fibonacci Retracement level of a prior up-move.

Thus, a long position can be initiated here and on dips for the target of Rs 263 and with a stop loss of Rs 215.

ITC

CMP: 286| RECO: BUY| TARGET: 315| STOP LOSS: 270

ITC reversed after taking support of its 50 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of recent rally (Rs 222-292) and later registered new life-time-high of Rs 296.

Positive cross-over in Stochastic and RSI is signaling strength in the stock.

As per the current weekly set-up, we believe the stock will continue its undergoing positive momentum and keep recording new highs.

On the lower side the stock will find support around its 20-week EMA, which is placed around Rs 270.

Tata Group continues to be India’s leading brand, according to the annual study of the leading brand in valuation firm Brand Finance. While the group has retained its top position, its value has fallen by four percent to USD 13.1 billion in 2017.

Contrary to the belief, this fall is not due to the boardroom battle between Ratan Tata and Cyrus Mistry, reports Business Standard. Between 2015 and 2016, the group’s value fell nearly 11 percent.

“There has been intense speculation as to whether brand value has fallen due to Tata’s boardroom drama,” David Haigh, CEO, Brand Finance said.

“In our view this is emphatically not the case. Tata’s brand strength index score in fact improved significantly this year and its rating was upgraded from A+ to AA+,” he said.

Instead, the fall in value is mostly due to challenging operating scenario in most of the industries.

Brand Finance believes that under the leadership of new chairman – N Chandrasekaran – Tata can re-grow its brand value.

The second most valued brand in India is mobile operator company Bharti Airtel with valuations of USD 7.7 billion. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) ranks third with USD 6.8 billion.

The study reveals that India’s total brand value increased 15 percent in 2017 – 68 of the 100 domestic companies have grown in value.

It firm Infosys lists of number fourth with valuation of USD 6.2 billion, a jump of one rank. Public bank State Bank of India has slipped to fifth rank from the third last year with USD 5.5 billion in valuation.

For this year, fast moving goods company (FMCG) ITC has been named the most powerful brand. “It is India’s only AAA rated brand, with a Brand Strength Index score of 86,” said the report.

The biggest loser has been mobile manufacturer Micromax, which dropped down to the 95th position. The company’s valuation reduced by 39 percent. The biggest gainer is IndiGo Airlines at 62nd position.

In its Brand Finance Global 500 2017, Google tops the list with USD 109,470 million valuation followed by iphone maker Apple with valuation of USD 107,141 million.

Third spot is taken by Amazon.com, followed by AT&T and Microsoft."

Diversified conglomerate ITC is learnt to be evaluating options for making a bid for Taj Mansingh hotel following the Supreme Court's decision to allow the NDMC to e-auction the iconic property.

The Tata Group hospitality arm, Indian Hotels Company, has already said it intends to participate in the bidding for the property, which it has been running for decades. When contacted, ITC declined to comment.

However,a company source said the company is evaluating its strategy for the same. ""We are evaluating the options,"" the source said. The Supreme Court had yesterday allowed the plea of NDMC that IHCL cannot have the right of refusal in the auctioning of the hotel.

The bench, however, had asked the civic body to grant six months ""breathing time"" to the company in vacating the hotel in case they lose out in the e-auction.

The apex court had also held that the ""blemish-free"" record of the Tata group firm may be taken into account by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) while auctioning the iconic property.

""We respect the decision of the Supreme Court and intend to participate in the e-auction when it is held. We stay committed to our colleagues and guests, whose loyalty and trust remains our biggest asset,"" a company spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. On March 3, the civic body had told the apex court that it wanted to e-auction the hotel.

The property, owned by the NDMC, was given to IHCL on a lease of 33 years. The lease had ended in 2011 and the company was given nine temporary extensions since then on various grounds, with three of them granted last year itself."

Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol Research

'Gambling is a sin, bet you can’t give it up'. The first part of that witticism could apply to alcohol and smoking; the second part could equally pertain to investing in such ‘sin’ stocks.

There's no denying that the addictive nature of the businesses makes companies in this space very attractive investments. Irrespective of the economic conditions, 'sin' businesses make great investment bets.

Most of the companies generate free cash flows, and have created a very strong brand image which acts as an entry barrier. They have high operating margins and are liberal with their dividend payouts. For any fund manager or investor, what’s not to like?

Over the years these companies have become so big that they are included in the broader indices, thus making it all the more difficult for big fund houses and insurance companies to avoid them. For a fund manager, shunning companies with good financials on 'moral' grounds is difficult, especially since his performance will be benchmarked with other fund managers and indices. The fund manager is answerable to his investors.

This is one of the reasons why the public interest litigation (PIL) filed against insurance regulator and state-run insurers for investing in tobacco company ITC does not hold water.

Seven members including some trustees of the Tata Trust in their personal capacities filed this PIL in the Bombay High Court against the Union government, the IRDAI and five state-run life insurance companies for investing in tobacco companies. The petition is to prevent LIC, the largest insurer in the country, from buying into the government’s stake sale in ITC. Ironically, the Tata trustee members who have filed a PIL do not seem bothered by the fact that most of the schemes of Tata Mutual Funds own ITC.

First of all, ITC was already held by the government through its ownership of SUUTI, and this is not technically a new purchase by the government or its agencies. If LIC buys out ITC’s 2 percent holding from the government, the stake is merely shifting from one pocket to another.

However, the petitioners argue that the investment is contradictory to the government’s measures to tackle tobacco-related health problems. They, however, forget that government earns a lot of taxes from these companies. Almost in every Budget it is the ‘sin tax’ that is increased – incidentally, hurting farmers who farm tobacco.

One needs to remember that the present sale by government is a secondary market sale. Thus, the company concerned (ITC) will not benefit in any way from the sale. Little purpose will be served in blocking the transaction. It will be the government who will be able to meet its divestment target and use the funds for the country’s development or for one of its social schemes.

This is not the first time that such claims are made against companies that are either ‘sinful’ in their business activities or are causing environmental damage. Many international NGOs are asking funds to stop investing in coal-related business because they are causing environmental harm.

But such activism rarely pays off especially if the business is allowed in the country in one form or the other. If one set of investors discover their conscience and do not buy, there will be many more who will replace them.

Ultimately, even for the fund manager it is a choice between two sins, greed and addiction, especially difficult when choosing both together has yielded gratifying returns and big bonuses.

A London Business School study done by professors Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton shows that sin stocks beat the market. The Vice Fund whose name was later changed to Barrier Fund and which specialises in investing in 'immoral' companies, was found to beat the socially responsible Vanguard Fund every year since 2002.

There is also the question of setting a precedent if state agencies are restricted from buying ITC. We could have other vigilantes objecting to investing in defence companies or some health-conscious group making a case for stopping investment in sugar companies or other companies which produce ‘unhealthy’ food.

The recent case of banning liquor sales on highways shows the danger of unintended consequences of such ‘righteous’ moves. Job losses on account of closure of vendors, impact on tourism and loss of taxes have led to many states bending the rules in favour of vice against virtue."

Reliance Industries today briefly toppled TCS as the country's most valued firm -- a position the Mukesh Ambani-led firm had held for many years before ceding it to Tatas' crown jewel more than four years ago.

RIL saw its market capitalisation (m-cap) soaring to a record high of about Rs 4.58 lakh crore in morning trade at around 1015 hours, exceeding TCS's Rs 4.56 lakh crore valuation at that time. Shares of RIL rose by over 1 per cent to a multi-year high of Rs 1,410 on BSE. The scrip of TCS gained 0.77 per cent to Rs 2,338.95. However, RIL's valuation later came down to Rs 4.52 lakh crore, which was Rs 4,508.4 crore less than that of TCS Rs 4.57 lakh crore m-cap at 1330 hrs.

With this, TCS reclaimed the status of the country's most valued firm followed by RIL, HDFC Bank, ITC and SBI in the top-five bunch. Shares of RIL have surged nearly 29 per cent so far this year, while TCS has lost nearly 2 per cent during the same period. TCS will announce its quarterly earnings today and RIL on Monday.

The Life Insurance Corporation’s investment in tobacco major ITC has once again come under the scanner following the Public Interest Litigation filed by Tata managing trustee R Venkataramanan, a project manager at Tata Trusts and doctors from Tata Memorial Hospital, questioning the decision, reports Economic Times.

The PIL names the government, state-run insurers, including LIC, and the insurance regulator, and says that the investment is contradictory to the government’s measures to tackle tobacco-related health problems.

Studies show that nearly a million people in India die every year due to health problems arising out of the use of tobacco.

In the past, too, health activists have questioned the government’s decision to invest in the tobacco major.

As of March 31, 2017, the government indirectly owns close to 30 percent in the tobacco major. The stakes are held through the Special Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (around 9 percent), LIC (around 16 percent) and through other state-owned insurance companies.

ITC now has diversified beyond tobacco and has interests in the hotel, farm and FMCG sectors. However, tobacco remains its most profitable venture and accounts for a sizeable chunk of its revenues and profits.

Global tobacco major BAT has been eyeing a controlling stake in ITC for a while now, but its attempts in the past have been repeatedly thwarted.

Recently, LIC hiked its stake in ITC by over 2 percent when the government sold a part of its stake held in SUUTI."

Diversified ITC is expanding its juice portfolio with an aim to garner around 20 percent market share in five years in the packaged fruit juice segment, currently estimated to be around Rs 2,500-crore.

Apart from adding new flavours and focusing on local fruits, the company is expanding its sales network to meet the target. It has also roped in Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty as brand ambassador for B Natural juices and beverages.

The Kolkata-based firm also plans to expand retail points of its luxury chocolate brand Fabelle and take it outside its hotel premises, where it is only available currently. ""We are going to add 2 to 3 percent market share every year and in next five years. It should be around 18 to 20 per cent in the next five years,"" ITC Foods Division Divisional Chief Executive Hemant Malik told PTI.

ITC ventured into the juice segment two years back and has presently around 7 per cent market share.

Market research firm Nielsen has estimated the packed juice segment market to be around Rs 2,500 crore and is growing rapidly, he added. In order to expand its juice product portfolio, he said ITC is focusing on local flavours and sell them under the same local name such as 'Kinnow' and 'Jamun Joy' under the B Natural brand.

""Today we have added pomegranate,"" Malik said. Commenting on network expansion, he said as the category is very less penetrated the focus is to make it available to a wider range of consumers. ITC is a late entrant in the packaged juice segment, which is largely dominated by PepsiCo's Tropicana and Real from homegrown FMCG major Dabur.

ITC had forayed into the premium packaged fruit drinks market in 2015 with the acquisition of the B Natural brand."

Food regulator FSSAI today said major wheat-flour brands like ITC, HUL, Cargill and Patanjali would begin to fortify wheat flour with iron, folic acid and vitamin B-12.

Fortification means deliberately increasing the content of essential micronutrients in food to improve its quality.

To address malnutrition, the FSSAI is promoting food fortification in a big way.

It had last year issued standards for fortification of salt with iodine and iron, of vegetable oil and milk with Vitamin A and D, wheat flour and rice with iron, folic acid, zinc, vitamin B12, vitamin A and some other micronutrients.

""Market leaders like the ITC, General Mills, Hindustan Unilever, Patanjali, and Cargill have agreed to start fortification of their flagship brands of wheat flour (atta) such as Aashirwaad, Pillsbury, Annapurna, Patanjali and Nature Fresh respectively,"" the FSSAI said in a statement.

They have already initiated the process and their fortified wheat flour would begin to be seen in the market in different regions by July/August and then scale up pan-India by December 2017, the regulator said.

The FSSAI said that the decision is the outcome of a series of meetings convened by it over past two months with related businesses, including medium and small industry players and development partners such as GAIN who have been associated with fortification of wheat flour over the past few years.

FSSAI CEO Pawan Agarwal said: ""Fortification Standards and a logo for fortified foods released by FSSAI recently, has provided a rallying point for food businesses to take up fortification on a large scale""."
"April 06, 2017 05:17 PM IST",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/market-ends-almost-flat-post-rbi-meet-nifty-closes-above-9250-banks-fall-realty-up-2254123.html,"Representative image

After witnessing volatile movements throughout the day, equity benchmarks ended the day on an almost flat note. The Sensex and the Nifty staged a recovery from the day’s low points after the Reserve Bank of India kept repo rates unchanged, but increased the reverse repo to 6 percent. The National Stock Exchange’s index closed above 9250-mark.

The Street had factored in the unchanged rate stance. A rally in real estate stocks in the last hour of trading also helped the market trim its losses.

The Sensex was down 46.90 points or 0.16% at 29927.34, while the Nifty was down 3.20 points or 0.03% at 9261.95. The market breadth narrow, but in the positive territory as 1,460 shares advanced against a decline of 1,412 shares, while 136 shares were unchanged.

ITC, State Bank of India and Hindalco were among the top losers, while BHEL, Tata Steel and Zee Entertainment were the top gainers on both indices.

The RBI, in its first policy meeting for this fiscal, decided to keep the repo rate—its key lending rate—unchanged at 6.25 percent on Thursday, and forecast robust a 7.4 growth in 2017-18 aided by waning effects of demonetisation, although inflation risks remain in the medium term.

""As the RBI is on hold for the moment, we expect short term bonds to outperform long bonds. Short bonds are less sensitive to the policy outlook as well as to global risks,"" R Sivakumar, Head-Fixed Income, Axis Mutual Fund told Reuters.

The status quo on rates, however, was accompanied by a string of regulatory changes including raising the reverse repo by 25 basis points to 6 percent, allowing banks to investment in real estate investment trusts (REITs), raising the minimum fund requirements of asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), allowing collateral substitution under repo that will give banks more funds to lend, and proposing the introduction of standing deposit facility (SDF)—another window for banks to borrow.

Based on these announcements, rate-sensitive stocks reacted as well.

Shares of real estate companies witnessed a surge as investors cheered the central bank’s decision on REITs. The central bank allowed banks to invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs) as well as infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs). DLF, Prestige Estates, Unitech, and Godrej Properties, among others surged between 1 and 6 percent intraday. A few of them even clocked their 52-week highs.

A REIT is a special form of corporation that invests primarily in real estate. REITs do not pay federal income taxes as long as they pay out 90% of their earnings to shareholders in the form of dividends.

""Allowing banks to invest in REITs is a big positive for realty stocks and we are already witnessing a bullish run up in them,"" Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research told moneycontrol.

""We also expect market to react maturely as it has survived and continued the bullish move in past and same is expected now with any correction being short-lived and overall momentum to continue,"" he said.

However, banks, capital goods and automobiles ended the session in the red zone.

Among stock-specific movements, Jindal Steel & Power (JSPL) added 5 percent intraday Thursday as the company recorded highest ever production and sales in FY17. The company's FY 2016-17 production and sales was over 4.8 million tonne.

Meanwhile, Bharat Forge share price touched fresh 52-week high on Thursday, up more than 3 percent intraday after sharp jump in North America truck orders during March. North American heavy truck (class 8) orders in March increased a whopping 41 percent to 22,800 units compared with same month last year, according to CNBC-TV18 reports quoting FTR.

Going forward, while the market may see a better performance, there are some factors one needs to be cautious say experts.

Religare Securities believes there is scope for the market to go up. ""We feel Nifty may spend a session or two around current levels before further surge. Traders should maintain the bullish bias and use any dip as buying opportunity. After the recent consolidation, auto can positively surprise any time soon but caution is advisable in stock selection. Furthermore, banking tops our favourite list followed by NBFCs, capital goods and select FMCG counters for short term trades,"" said Jayant Manglik, President, Retail Distribution, Religare Securities, in a statement.

Samir Arora, Fund Manager, Helios Capital told CNBC-TV18 that the Indian equity market rallied quite a bit and needs to pause but the pause always comes with an excuse. According to him, liquidity flow could be impacted in the month of April because investors may not buy India on back of tax uncertainties.

The market has been witnessing a bull run, with the indices touching record highs, both intraday and closing, and is just a few points away from key milestones. The Nifty hit an intraday high of 9274 on Wednesday before ending above 9250, while the Sensex hit 30,000-mark intraday before closing below that mark."

We are cautiously optimistic on markets and prefer companies with strong earnings visibility, good pricing power and long-term structural triggers, Gautam Duggad, Head of Research, MOSL, said in an exclusive interview with Kshitij Anand of moneycontrol.

Some of our top ideas include names like Tata Motors, ICICI Bank, SBI, ITC, Britannia, Hindalco, Colgate Palmolive India, Crompton Consumer, IOC Ltd, RBL Bank, Manpasand Beverages, Ultratech Cements and JK Cement, he said.

Below are the excerpts from the interview:

Q) FY17 already created a history as benchmark indices hit a fresh record high. Do you think FY18 will be another year of record highs or markets are likely to stay rangebound?

A) We think FY18 returns are going to be a function of revival in earnings growth. Earnings growth has been elusive so far. While the macro backdrop is solid with strong flows and reform momentum, the revival of earnings is crucial for further upsides from here. Valuations at 22.5x trailing and 18.3x forward PE do not leave much room for re-rating.

Q) What are your top stocks investors can buy in FY18 which have the potential to give multibagger returns in the next 2-3 years?

A) We are cautiously optimistic on markets and prefer companies with strong earnings visibility, good pricing power, and long term structural triggers. We like several ideas across the large cap, mid cap, and small cap space.

Some of our top ideas are – Tata Motors, ICICI Bank, SBI, ITC, Britannia, Hindalco, Colgate Palmolive India, Crompton Consumer, IOC Ltd, RBL Bank, Manpasand Beverages, Ultratech Cements and JK Cement.

From a longer term perspective, value migration owing to the disruption unleashed by government post-GST and demonetisation will mean that unorganized to organized shift across sectors – Jewelry, Consumer Electricals, Tiles, Home Building, NBFC etc – will remain in vogue for next 3-5 years.

Q) Indian market rose 18 percent in the financial year 2017, but it underperformed global peers such as Brazil which gained 31 percent, followed by Russia which was up 28 percent, and Germany which rallied 22 percent in same period. How will India fare with respect to global peers?

A) Comparison with global markets for a limited time period is little unfair as markets like Brazil and Russia had underperformed earlier.

Returns of Indian markets vis-à-vis global peers will be a function of flows and earnings revival. On macros, India has everything going for it – strong GDP growth, robust macroeconomic backdrop with twin deficits under control, inflation within targeted band and currency stable.

What is currently lacking is micros – the revival of earnings momentum. Globally, the capital will chase growth.

Q) Sectors which according to you will remain hot in the financial year 2018.

A) BFSI – largest sector with several interesting fronts opening up and the possibility of new listings – Insurance, SFB, MFI etc.

Discretionary Consumption - Autos, Consumer – Revival in consumer spending post demonetization.

Oil & Gas - OMC’s will continue to remain in focus post de-regulation and with crude prices locked in a tight range.

Q) Any advice you would want to give to your readers to start following in the coming financial year?

A) Do proper asset allocation and invest consistently and regularly over a period of time. If you don’t have the expertise to invest on your own, invest through mutual funds.

Q) Do you see liquidity tap to remain open in FY18 amid a rise in US bond yields as well as Federal Reserve rates?

A) Increasingly, over the last 24 months, DII flows have dominated the institutional flows (US$ 16bn of DII flows vs. US$ 6bn of FII flows). FII flows will be a function of dollar trade and earnings revival.

Overall we believe India will get its fair share of emerging market inflows given that it is one of the most attractive EM stories right now with a robust macro backdrop. We expect domestic flows to remain healthy as a percentage of financial assets goes up within the overall household savings.

Q) Now that we have clarity on GST, what are your expectations from the Modi govt on reform front in the next FY?

A) Flawless implementation of GST will be crucial to avoid any trade disruption and the consequent impact on earnings. Government’s push towards formalization of the economy will continue in our view.

Going forward, we expect more initiatives from the government on black money, financial inclusion, non-performing assets of PSU Banks and overall infrastructure thrust in the absence of pick up in private capex. Recent election victories in UP should augment the reform momentum.

Q) Some analysts see Donald Trump as the biggest risk to global markets. What are your views, do you also see 10 percent kind of fall in US markets if tax reforms doesn’t go through

A) It is tough to predict returns in the short term especially if it hinges on a particular event. Some part of the rally in US markets is attributable to expectations of pick up in infrastructure spending and potential tax reforms.

So to that extent, it will react if the anticipated measures do not go through. However, over a long term we believe, equity markets anywhere in the world will be a slave of earnings growth."

The institute, a body representing interests of legal cigarette makers such as ITC, Godfrey Philips and VST, also said the government must also consider the plight of distressed tobacco farmers.

""GST presents a unique opportunity to government to address the growing illegal cigarette trade in the country,"" said TII Director Syed Mahmood Ahmad.

This would also help ""distressed tobacco farmers, the legal cigarette industry and also inject buoyancy in revenue collection from this sector,"" it added.

TII represents leading cigarette manufacturers accounting for more than 98 per cent of the country's domestic sales of duty paid cigarettes.

Yesterday, the Lok Sabha approved four legislations for GST. The Centre has set the target of July 1 to roll out the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

""Indeed in recent months and as credit to the enforcement agencies, the incidence of seizures of smuggled cigarettes, as reported in the media, has seen a sharp spurt in different parts of the country,"" it said.

According to a recently released FICCI Report, cigarettes are among the top five smuggled goods in the country with far reaching impact on various stakeholders including the government, domestic industry and society at large, TII added."

Nifty has taken two years to cross the 9000 level but this 360-degree recovery seems to riding on the hope of strong fundamentals going ahead. Major decisions including GST rollout and demonetisation taken by the Central government since it came in power in 2014 are likely to take centre-stage in the investment discourse on India over the next 2-3 years. But earnings will be a significant driver for further upside in markets, finds a Motilal Oswal report.

""Demonetisation and progress on GST have been the two most significant macro developments. Together, these two reforms have the potential to alter the investment landscape for several sectors. The obvious consequence of these two reforms is a greater formalisation of the economy and value migration from the unorganised to the organised segment,"" it reasons.

After a sharp 15 percent rally in three months, the market seems to have largely shrugged the impact of demonetisation and valuations already have become stretched. This rally was largely backed by conducive macro factors – inflation under control, twin deficits within tolerance limits, government sticking to the fiscal consolidation path, and stable currency among others.

The brokerage house says valuations for the Nifty based on both one-year forward earnings and on trailing earnings are rich but at similar levels to March 2015.

Motilal Oswal says Goods & Services Tax (GST) is on track for implementation from July 1, 2017. The BJP's strong showing in the recent UP elections (won 4/5th majority) should provide tailwinds for further reforms. The political calendar is light, as the next major assembly elections are due only in January 2018 (Gujarat). But earnings recovery is the only missing link, according to the research house.

It expects around 23 percent earnings growth in FY18 but delivery of the projected earnings growth is crucial for valuations to sustain and expand.

While FY18 would benefit from a low base in the second half of FY17 (demonetisation impact), there are two important near-term earnings headwinds to watch for - one is inflation in commodity prices, which could erode margins for B2C sectors like autos, consumer and cement, and second is the implementation of GST, which could impact earnings for a quarter or two (inventory adjustment in trade, initial implementation hurdles), the brokerage house says.

A Look Back at the Past

Over March 2015 – March 2017, institutional flows were dominated by DIIs. While inflows from DIIs were USD 15.9 billion, inflows from FIIs were relatively muted at USD billion. The shift in institutional flows in favour of DIIs are reflected in the sharper outperformance of midcaps and small caps. The Nifty CNX Midcap index has delivered 22 percent return over this timeframe, outperforming the Nifty by 21 percent. Also, over the last two years, the foreign ownership of Nifty stocks has reduced by 140bp whereas the ownership of DIIs and other domestic investors has increased by 190bp, the brokerage house says.

FIIs have increased their stake by 550-1,050bp in Eicher Motors, Adani Ports and BPCL, but have reduced their stake in Grasim, ICICI Bank and Ambuja Cement. DIIs have increased their holdings by 600-800bp in Kotak Mahindra Bank, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank and Cipla, but have reduced their holdings by 200-500bp in BPCL, Maruti and Eicher Motors.

Following are top investment ideas from Motilal Oswal:

Indian Oil Corporation

PSU oil retailer IOC shot up 117 percent in two years period and nearly 14 percent in 2017 amid lower crude oil prices and deregulation of petrol & diesel prices.

Britannia Industries

Bakery products manufacturer showed consistent performance in its earnings. During March 2015 to September 2016, its profit grew by 212 percent on half yearly basis.

Motilal Oswal in its report dated March 7 said Britannia's FY16 annual report highlighted a healthy operating performance, with revenue growing 10 percent YoY to Rs 8,680 crore and EBITDA margin expanding 310bp YoY to 14.1 percent led by benign commodity prices and premiumisation. Operating cash flow increased to Rs 960 crore (FY15: Rs 580 crore), supported by Rs 150 crore reduction (FY15: Rs 160 crore increase) in bank deposits; adjusted for this, operating cash flow was Rs 820 crore (FY15: Rs 740 crore).

The stock gained 57 percent in last two years and 17 percent in 2017.

Hindalco Industries

Aluminium major Hindalco Industries climbed 25 percent in two years and nearly 24 percent in 2017, backed by rally in commodity prices and hopes of revival in earnings.

ITC

Cigarette-hotel-to-FMCG major ITC saw a rally of more than 17 percent in current calendar year after lower-than-expected excise duty hike on cigarettes and improvement in earnings. Analysts expect no change in total tax incidence on tobacco post GST implementation.

JK Cement

Incorporated in 1975, JK Cement, the second largest white cement manufacturer, gained nearly 25 percent in 2017 on hopes of revival in infrastructure sector.

The brokerage house in its report dated March 27, said company's FY16 annual report highlighted an improvement in the operating performance, with consolidated EBITDA rising 21 percent to Rs 550 crore (FY15: Rs 450 crore) due to stabilisation at UAE operations and cost-control measures. However, consolidated PAT declined 57 percent, with the margin contracting to a five-year low of 1.6 percent due to higher finance and depreciation charges.

UltraTech Cement

In its report dated March 24, Motilal Oswal said it believes the company's increasing presence in a market dominated by tier-II players would improve the business dynamics in the region. With the completion of Jaiprakash Associates' acquisition by UltraTech in Q1FY18, the brokerage house expects the company to ramp up the utilisation of these assets to 60 percent over the next 6-9 months. The stock gained 23 percent in FY17.

Colgate Palmolive

After meeting the management of Colgate, the brokerage house enthused about its longer-term business prospects, said the company has weathered the storm from herbal players like Patanjali, with minimal damage to its market share in the last three quarters. It believes the sharp dip towards the end of FY16 was only a small blip in what has been a longer-term uptrend in market share.

Given its rural dominance, Colgate is a great play on rural recovery, it feels. It said valuations are lower than the average 3-year and 5-year multiples.

Colgate has best-of-breed return on equity, strong earnings growth prospects, and best-in-class dividend yield, which is likely to rise rapidly now that a major part of the capex is over, said the brokerage house while maintaining buy on the stock in its recent research report (March 20).

The stock gained more than 9 percent in 2017.

Bharti Airtel

The country's largest telecom operator stock price rallied 13 percent in 2017 but fell nearly 2 percent in two years due to pricing competition.

State Bank of India

The stock fell 2 percent in two years but gained 15 percent on hopes of early resolution to non-performing assets and ahead of merger of associate banks with itself.

Larsen & Toubro

After meeting with management, Motilal Oswal, on March 6, said company's base orders in infrastructure (which includes water, T&D and transport infrastructure) would drive order inflow in Q4FY17 and domestic execution pick-up is likely in FY18.

It further said the company is exposed to several levers across its business/geographical segments. It has emerged as the engineering & construction partner of choice in India, which provides it with a robust platform to capitalise on the next leg of investment cycle. It maintained a buy call with an SOTP-based price target of Rs 1,660.

The stock gained 15 percent in FY17 on hopes of revival in earnings in FY18 after sluggish growth.

Tata Motors

The stock fell 0.5 percent in current calendar year (2017) and lost 17 percent in two years because of subdued earnings performance of Jaguar Land Rover. However, analysts still confident of revival in earnings performance due to likely new launches from JLR going ahead.

The brokerage house in its report dated February 3, said Tata Motors was one of its top picks in auto space, with a target price of Rs 775 after company's new strategy for the passenger vehicle business and sub-brand/vertical TAMO.

""We see these initiatives as step in right direction and infuse more energy in TTMT’s PV business by giving autonomy and ring-fencing TAMO vertical to focus on innovation. This could long way in transforming PV business through agility, adaptability and making business leaner and meaner,"" it said.

Tata Motors, on Wednesday, has launched the Tigor – a subcompact, sub-4 meter sedan with style-back design – in India.

Motilal Oswal believes the Tigor should do well, given that the company has come up with an aggressive pricing strategy. ""TTMT is well on its course with its strategy to cater to every segment of passenger vehicles with its new offerings. The next in line is the much-awaited compact SUV Nexon.""

ICICI Bank

Country's largest private sector lender stock price lost 19 percent in two years but gained 10 percent on likely strong earnings in FY18 post NPA concerns.

Jindal Steel

In its report dated March 10, Motilal Oswal said after visiting Angul steel plant, company appeared to be on track to more than double its steel capacity at Angul to 5 million tonnes (from current around 2 million tonnes) in two years by adding capacity through a more efficient hot metal production route (currently DRI).

With this, steel sales volumes will increase from around 3.3 million tonnes in FY17 to 5.8 million tonnes by FY19, implying a CAGR of 31 percent, the brokerage house said. It expects consolidated EBITDA CAGR FY17-19 of 32 percent to Rs 7,800 crore. Although adjusted PAT would remain negative due to bloated depreciation on massive asset revaluation, there will be a sharp turnaround in cash profits, it says while retaining buy call on the stock.

The stock price shot up 71 percent in current calendar year (2017) on rally in commodity prices and production capacity expansion.

RBL Bank

Maharashtra-based RBL Bank (erstwhile Ratnakar Bank) share price surged 45 percent on strong financials and fundamentals. Asset quality also improved in October-December quarter. The bank raised Rs 1,100 crore through its IPO in August 2016.

Crompton Greaves Consumer Electrical

Home appliances and LED bulbs maker was demerged from Crompton Greaves and later on acquired by private equity firms Temasek & Advent International in 2016. The stock gained 42 percent in 2017.

The government may sell some of its stake in Axis Bank, Larsen and Toubro and ITC through an exchange traded fund, reports BloombergQuint.

Sources privy to the development say that this ETF would be larger than the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE) ETF, a fund unveiled in 2014 that was made up of the government’s shares in state-owned companies.

Post the newsbreak yesterday, the price of all three stocks fell.

The government currently holds 12.02 percent stake in Axis Bank, 9.10 percent in ITC and 6.69 percent in L&T, through the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI). This is after considering the recent 2 percent stake sale in ITC.

The government had revised its disinvestment target for FY17 to Rs 45,500 from Rs 56,500 earlier and for FY18 the government hopes to raise a humongous Rs 72,500 crore.

Government officials told NewsRise it is not yet decided to include the SUUTI holdings in the ETF stake sale. The government is free to include any of its equity holdings under the new ETF.

SUUTI was formed in 2003 as an extension of the Unit Trust of India (UTI). It comprises 51 companies -- 8 unlisted and the rest listed companies. Through SUUTI, the government holds minority stake in these companies and divests its shareholding from time to time."

The Sensex lost more than 300 points, weighed by global weakness amid rising uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's economic policies, and Missile test in North Korea, which reports said failed. Recent government's proposal to reduce cash transactions limit to Rs 2 lakh from Rs 3 lakh also caused selling pressure.

The market fell for third consecutive session, with the 30-share BSE Sensex down 317.77 points or 1.08 percent at 29,167.68 and the 50-share NSE Nifty falling 91.05 points or 1 percent to 9,030.45, dragged by heavyweights ITC and ICICI Bank.

After three-day consolidation, finally the market got direction on downside but that is unlikely to continue, feel experts who say the Nifty has support at 9,000.

""Nifty has almost reached closer to 9000 mark and downside now seems capped from the current level. However, stocks may continue to trade volatile after the recent slide,"" Jayant Manglik, President of Religare Securities says.

He advises traders to limit leveraged positions and keep them hedged. Consolidation is more likely in near future, he feels.

Inderjeet Singh Bhatia of Macquarie Research says valuations definitely are on the higher side. ""Somehow the market continues to ignore the short-term earnings pain in expectation on long-term improvement both in earnings and in reforms coming through from the government side,"" he adds.

Asian and European markets were down following a negative lead from Wall Street. France's CAC, Germany's DAX and Britain's FTSE fell more than 0.6 percent, at the time of closing of Indian equities. Japan's Nikkei lost 2 percent on missile test in North Korea and stronger yen.

Back home, the broader markets fell nearly a percent on weak breadth. About two shares declined for every share rising on the BSE.

All sectoral indices barring Pharma (up 0.2 percent) and Realty (up 0.6 percent) closed in red. Nifty Bank, Auto, FMCG and Metal indices were down 1-1.7 percent.

ITC was the biggest contributor to Sensex' fall, down 2.75 percent followed by L&T (down 1.3 percent) and Axis Bank (down 0.7 percent). These stocks were under pressure, especially after agencies told CNBC-TV18 that the Government of India may sell its stake in Axis Bank and L&T through exchange traded funds (ETF).

Among others, Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank and Tata Motors were top losers, down 2.5-3 percent followed by HDFC, HDFC Bank, SBI and Maruti Suzuki.

In broader space, jewellery stocks like PC Jeweller, Gitanjali Gems and Titan Company dropped 2-4 percent after the government's fresh proposal to cap cash transaction limit at Rs 2 lakh from Rs 3 lakh currently.

NLC India shares gained 7 percent on management's positive commentary for Q4 and FY18. However, ABG Shipyard was locked at 5 percent lower circuit on doubt over recovery of various advances."

ITC helped the market close in green while banks, infra and telecom stocks were under pressure on profit booking.

The 30-share BSE Sensex was up 63.14 points at 29,648.99 and the 50-share NSE Nifty gained 6.35 points at 9,160.05.

After a record high, experts expect some consolidation before the Sensex crossing psychological 30,000-mark next week. Overall they remain upbeat on markets, expecting the 15-20 percent returns in current calendar year. Valuations will remain elevated, they feel.

Riding high on the liquidity bandwagon, the Nifty, which has already rallied over 12 percent so far in 2017, looks poised to hit 9,500-9600 mark in the next 4-6 weeks, says Mohammed Apabhai of Citigroup Global Markets.

He believes that the market is nowhere close to 2008 bubble.

Meanwhile, almost 14 of 18 fund managers and analysts polled are of the view that the Sensex is likely to hover in a range of 30,000-35,000 soon.

The broader markets underperformed benchmarks, with the BSE Midcap falling 0.1 percent on weak breadth. About 1578 shares declined while 1243 shares advanced on the exchange.

For the week, the Sensex rallied 2.4 percent and Nifty gained 2.5 percent on BJP's landslide victory in Uttar Pradesh & Uttarakhand and Federal Reserve's rate hike decision.

The rupee snapped four-day gains, down 4 paise to close at 65.45 a dollar. It fell more than 25 paise intraday but managed to trim losses in later part of the session.

ITC posted biggest one-day gain in last 10 months, rising nearly 5 percent as analysts remained upbeat on the stock after GST Council decided to cap the cess rate on tobacco products at Rs 4,170 per 1,000 sticks or 290 percent ad valorem.

Tata Steel hit 2.5-year high intraday, up 0.6 percent at close after Credit Suisse raised target on the stock to Rs 600, citing likely higher output and better spreads in European Union industry.

Nifty Bank closed in red as SBI was down 1.7 percent and ICICI Bank fell 1.3 percent. However, HDFC Bank (up 0.55 percent) and Axis Bank (up 0.66 percent) capped downside.

Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular were biggest losers among Nifty stocks, down around 4 percent. Among others, Infosys gained 1 percent whereas L&T, M&M, ONGC and Bajaj Auto were down a percent each.

Music Broadcast gained 12 percent on debut, closing at Rs 373 against issue price of Rs 333.

In broader space, Godrej Properties rose 3.6 percent as Morgan Stanley remained overweight on the stock with a target price of Rs 433 on strong brand equity, geographic diversification, potential to unlock value from project/land acquisitions and reasonable valuation.

United Bank of India was up nearly 7 percent. The government will infuse Rs 418 crore as part of turnaround-linked capital infusion plan.

The Goods & Services Tax (GST) inched closer to becoming a reality on Thursday after the GST Council paved the way for rolling out the new tax regime, clearing all legislations required for the implementation of the tax by July 1, 2017.

The Council, which met in the national capital, approved the State GST (SGST) and the Union Territory GST (UTGST) bills. The bills will now have to be cleared by Parliament and state assemblies.

The Council also approved a maximum of 15 percent cess on top of the peak GST rate of 28 percent on luxury goods and aerated drinks.

""Tobacco cess will be capped at a mixture of Rs 4,170 per 1,000 sticks or ad valorem of 290 percent. Cess on coal would be at Rs 400 per ton. No decision has been taken to levy cess on bidis as of now,"" an official said.

Going by the buzz on D-Street we have collated a list of the top five stocks which are likely to benefit more from the implementation of GST:

ITC: BUY| Target Rs 325

CLSA maintains a buy rating on ITC with a 12-month target price of Rs 325 as GST tax structure is likely to be a revenue-neutral outcome which comes as a big relief for ITC.

The government has come up with a cap on cess for several products and there is a cap of Rs 4.17/stick or 290 percent ad valorem on cigarettes – by itself, this information does not help and in fact adds to the confusion.

Media reports indicate there would be no excise duty on top of cess (along with 28 percent GST). “We see this as positive news for ITC, given that there have been investor concerns on the eventual outcome as tobacco has been identified among the sectors to be tapped for compensation to states in case of a revenue shortfall,” said the CLSA report.

Voltas: BUY| Target Rs 448

ICICI Securities maintains a buy rating on Voltas with a target price of Rs 448. Voltas is a market leader in the air conditioners segment and the share price has been trending up post its Q32017 earnings outcome as worries of demonetisation impact on sales faded away.

The discretionary spending in India will receive a significant boost primarily driven by expectation of robust economic growth. Despite various challenges such as demonetisation and rising input prices Voltas has retained its top position with 21 percent market share in the RAC segment, due to its strong reach in tier-II and tier-III cities.

Strong fundamentals (net cash status, RoCE and RoE of 24 percent, 18 percent), dividend payout of ~30 percent and ability to pass on the rising input prices and lowest penetration of AC in India (among other white goods items) suggests the long-term growth story of Voltas will remain intact.

Teamlease: BUY| Target Rs 1200

Kotak Institutional Equities upgraded the stock to buy from Add earlier with a target price of Rs 1,200. The domestic brokerage firm is of the view that the recent correction, as well as the underperformance of stock presents good buying opportunity.

Kotak believes that structural drivers such as GST, labour law simplification will sustain stable growth. TeamLease's core temporary staffing business seems to be on a solid footing, it said.

Titan Company Ltd: BUY| Target Rs 548

ICICI Securities maintains a buy rating on Titan Company with a target price of Rs 548 as the impact of demonetisation was much more significant for unorganised players due to a higher proportion of cash transactions compared to the organised market.

This led to an increase in market share for Titan as many unorganised players have lost market share significantly. In addition to the rollout of GST Titan would be a beneficiary of the shift from unorganised to organised players.

“The company is also looking at garnering a higher share of studded jewellery, which would aid margin growth in FY18E and FY19E. The company is expected to gain market share driven by the shift from unorganised to organised players,” it said.

Kansai Nerolac: BUY| Target Rs 425

ICICI Securities maintains a buy rating on Kansai Nerolac with a target of Rs 425. Kansai is well placed in the industrial and decorative paints segments to benefit from a boost in consumption due to the higher disposable income (on account of Seventh Pay Commission) GST and expectation of better monsoons.

With sustainable revenue growth, improving margins, higher free cash flows and expanding return ratios, Kansai would continue to command premium valuation multiples compared to its historic averages

“We have modelled revenue, earning CAGR of 13 percent and 9 percent, respectively, for FY17E-19E and value the company on 38x FY19E earnings with target price at Rs 425/share,” said the report.

Several food and drink multinationals and trade groups met in recent weeks to discuss how to lobby more effectively against Indian proposals for higher taxes and stricter labelling rules on fatty or sugary foods, sources familiar with the talks said.

According to officials, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has begun to look closely at policy proposals under discussion since at least 2015, raising concerns over the possible impact on the $57 billion sector.

Alarmed by rising rates of obesity and diabetes, India plans to frame draft rules within a month requiring manufacturers to display the fat, sugar and salt content of products on packaging.

It is also considering a nationwide ""fat tax"" for so-called ""junk foods"", a senior government official said, although that is unlikely to be rolled out in the near term.

Last month, executives from companies including PepsiCo, Nestle and Indian consumer firm ITC met trade groups in New Delhi to coordinate efforts and urge the government to resist pressure from health advocates, according to an industry source aware of the meeting.

The attendees, who felt their efforts to push back had been too piecemeal, talked about forming a core group to unify their message when engaging the government, the source said.

PepsiCo and Nestle in India did not comment directly on the meeting or its outcome. ITC did not respond to requests for comment.

Trade group All India Food Processors' Association (AIFPA), whose members range from street vendors to global conglomerates, said two industry-wide meetings were held in February.

Its members, who also discussed ways to offer more nutritious products, plan to send a joint representation to the government and approach health and food officials to express concerns about stringent regulations.

PROMISING GROWTH

The stakes are high for companies like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Nestle and McDonald's, which have collectively committed billions of dollars to expand in the world's fastest growing major economy.

India's carbonated drinks sector is estimated to grow an average 3.7 percent annually between 2017 and 2021, while the packaged food sector will grow by 8 percent a year during the same period, Euromonitor International estimates.

Government pressure comes in various forms.

Modi recently told PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi that her company needed to focus more on public health, an aide to the prime minister said.

Separately, the prime minister's office asked PepsiCo to outline how it would reduce sugar in beverages sold in India, the aide added.

PepsiCo did not comment on those remarks by Modi and his office. It referred Reuters to its October 2016 global commitment ""to transform its portfolio and offer healthier options"". Modi's office did not respond to an email seeking comment.

A Coca-Cola India representative referred questions on proposed regulatory changes to the Indian Beverage Association, which said their impact was ""under evaluation"".

Nestle corporate affairs executive Sanjay Khajuria said the company was ""working to improve the nutrient profile"" of their products.

""These are complex public health issues which require (a) holistic multi-stakeholder approach and we are committed to work with authorities,"" Khajuria said in an email.

The CEO of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Pawan Kumar Agarwal, welcomed industry concerns about tougher rules.

""It is a good thing if it helps in providing healthier options,"" he told Reuters in an interview.

PLANNED REGULATIONS

The number of obese men and women in India rose to about 30 million by 2014 from 1.2 million in 1975, according to a study by British medical journal The Lancet, although the comparative figure for China was around 90 million.

Concerns about the health effects of fast food and soda drinks have been growing globally in recent years.

Mexico imposed higher taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, for example, while South Korea placed television advertising restrictions on specific food items.

But India has been slow to finalise rules on products high in fat, sugar and salt, whose consumption health advocates say urgently needs to be checked to safeguard public health.

Agarwal denied industry pressure was affecting the implementation of tighter regulations, adding that India was nudging companies to make healthier products while working on new rules.

The FSSAI is considering advertising norms to check on health claims made by companies and is working on educating consumers about the health effects of foods containing high levels of sugar or fat.

One government official said the regulator was deliberating whether disclosures about the nutritional value of food should be placed on the front of packages.

Another labelling proposal under review was a ""traffic light"" system, where red, yellow and green colours depict nutritional value, similar to one used in the United Kingdom. ""Traffic light is making (reading labels) simple,"" Agarwal said. ""Red people associate with danger, green is okay"".

But trade body AIFPA said such labelling was of no use.

""Most Indian foods will be red. So what purpose does it serve?"" said the group's president, Subodh Jindal.

Potentially more significant for major brands would be a nationwide ""fat tax"", which authorities are discussing and was last year announced by the southern state of Kerala.

There, branded restaurants like McDonald's and Domino's Pizza face a 14.5 percent tax, higher than that applied to smaller, indigenous outlets serving the same fare or Indian cuisine often high in sugar and fat.

""It makes the larger players nervous,"" said an industry executive, calling the discourse on ""junk food"" in India discriminatory and unscientific.

McDonald's India did not comment on the government's discussions on a nationwide ""fat tax"". Domino's India said its spokesman was not available."

In February 2001, Radhakishan Damani, now better known as the owner of supermarket chain D-Mart, stunned the market by making a hostile bid for VST Industries, controlled by British American Tobacco (BAT).

At that point Damani had already acquired a cult status on Dalal Street -- both as a trader and value investor.

But even Damani’s closest associates were surprised by this act of aggression, completely at odds with his soft-spoken and reclusive nature.

Through his investment arm Bright Star Investments, Damani had by then accumulated a shade below 15 percent in the company over the previous 12 months at an average price of Rs 88 per share. He was now willing to pay Rs 112 per share for an additional 20 percent in the company, a 26-percent premium to the market price on the day he announced the bid.

A messy bidding war ensued, as ITC entered the fray with a counter offer to thwart Damani, counted among India's savviest stock market investors, from taking control of VST.

It is still not clear if ITC – then also controlled by BAT -- had done so at the prodding of its foreign principal, or if the move was motivated by self-interest.

ITC chairman YC Deveshwar’s public stance was that BAT should not be allowed to hike its stake in VST.

“Why should we allow BAT to increase stake in VST? We are trying to do many things to control consumption of tobacco and at the same time you want to encourage it,"" Deveshwar had said at the company’s AGM in August 2001.

And it soon became evident that there were far too many obstacles—regulatory, competitive and cultural--for Damani to be able to walk away with his much-coveted prize.

ITC initially made an open offer at Rs 115 per share and later increased that to Rs 126 per share. Damani eventually raised the price and size of his bid--Rs 151 per share for 30 percent of the company--but failed to win over the banks, insurance companies and financial institutions that together held 22 percent in the company. Through the open offer, Bright Star managed to increase its stake to around 20 percent, but Damani’s dream of owning a controlling stake in VST remained just that, a dream.

Nearly sixteen years on, RK Damani has every reason to feel satisfied despite the injury to his pride. VST shares are now trading around Rs 2700, valuing Bright Star's investment in the company (25.95 percent as on December 31, 2016) at roughly Rs 1100 crore. That is an almost 20 times-return from the time Damani first started accumulating the shares way back in 2000.

According to a back-of-the-envelope calculation, the acquisition cost of VST shares for Bright Star is less than zero, considering the hefty dividend pay-outs over the last nine years. Between July 2002 and April 2016, Bright Star has pocketed around Rs 175 crore through annual dividends ranging between Rs 4.50 and Rs 70 per share. Bright Star’s first 15 percent in VST cost it around Rs 20 crore (average price of Rs 88), and the next 5 percent (assuming the open offer price of Rs 151 and some open market purchases) would have cost around Rs 11 crore.

Between March 2003 and March 2005, Bright Star added a further 4 percent when the stock price ranged between Rs 90-350. Even assuming an average price of Rs 275, that stake would have cost not more than Rs 20 crore. The last tranche of roughly 2 percent was purchased between March 2007 and March 2009, when the price was declining and ranged between Rs 350 and Rs 210 (the high during the period being Rs 450). That would have cost not more than Rs 10-12 crore, even assuming an average price in excess of Rs 300. In summary, Damani’s Bright Star is unlikely to have forked out more than Rs 63 crore for the 25.95 percent stake that it is currently holding. And dividends alone have netted over Rs 175 crore over the years.

Looking back at the failed bid for VST, even today Damani’s close friends are not sure what prompted him to make that audacious open offer. On the face of it, VST appeared a good investment. Cash flows were good and the entry barriers in the business were high. But was it compelling enough to lock horns with a power multinational like BAT?

“Maybe he wanted to draw attention to the fact the stock was undervalued,” says one broker who has known him for the last couple of decades.

“By provoking a bidding war, he was hoping that the stock’s market value would get a boost. It is unlikely that he would have underestimated BAT’s clout to hit back. There was no way that BAT would have watched silently and allowed him to put them out of business,” he says.

Perhaps Damani was betting that BAT would not be able to counter attack quickly enough, given the policy restrictions on foreign tobacco companies increasing their investments in India. Yet, nothing went right for Damani from the time he made the open offer in February. ITC, through its investment arm Russell Credit, made a counter offer for VST, and this was approved by SEBI.

In contrast, the approval for Bright Star’s open offer was delayed, and one of the reasons cited was a regulatory probe into Damani’s alleged involvement in the stock market crash a few months back.

Despite Bright Star offering a better price than ITC, financial institutions refused to side with Damani, a decision that could have to do with political reasons rather than an investment view.

Finally, when Bright Star's open offer commenced, VST advanced its book closure date by a day just before the last date of the open offer. Bright Star and its investment banker ASK Raymond James cried foul, alleging that it was a deliberate move to foil investors looking to buy VST shares from the open market and tender them in the open offer.

Ultimately, Damani has been proved right in his bet on VST Industries, though his original game plan may have been a bit grander.

India's largest life insurer -- Life Insurance Corporation -- will announce its quarterly numbers Monday. But, in what would be the first time in its six decades of existence, the company’s Chairman will also hold a press conference to discuss the results, reports the Business Standard today.

With nearly 72.61 percent market share of the life insurance industry and an investment corpus bigger than the entire mutual fund industry put together, the insurance giant has taken the initiative to address the media as part of its strategy to make its presence and importance known to India Inc. and the stock market.

LIC holds sizeable stakes of over 10 percent in 49 companies including index heavyweights like L&T (15.7 percent), Bharat Heavy Engineering & ITC (14.3 percent each), Tata Steel (13.6 percent), Hindalco (11.4 percent), and M&M (10.3 percent). Among other investments, it has over 10 percent stake in banking majors Corporation Bank (18.9 percent), Axis Bank (13.9 percent), Punjab National Bank (12.5 percent), and ICICI Bank (10.9 percent).

In March 2016, it had an investment corpus of roughly Rs 22.1 lakh crore, much higher than the industry’s total of Rs 17 lakh crore. Investments of 23 other insurers totalled Rs 18 lkah crore as the end of FY16.

Market experts consider the move to formally announce results as a much-needed step in improving the transparency, particularly considering the size of its investments in the industry behemoths. Despite its huge investments across the industry with a say in most boardroom decisions with the high equity stake, the insurance major would, so far, discreetly post its annual report on its website without much hype."

The spectacular rally in Reliance Industries shares on Wednesday, especially after Jio's new tariff plans, pushed benchmark indices to over fresh five-month highs. The stock rallied 10.14 percent intraday to Rs 1,198.60, the highest level since May 19, 2009. In post-afternoon trade, the scrip hit Rs 1,200-mark as well.

Its contribution to Sensex as well as Nifty is so high that it seems like Reliance alone driving the market higher, though selling pressure in other heavyweights like Infosys, HDFC and HDFC Bank limited market upside.

Currently (at 13:10 hours IST) Reliance Industries' contribution to Sensex stood at 169 points, when the Sensex gained 189 points. However, Infosys, HDFC and HDFC Bank contributed around 80-90 points on the downside.

Reliance weightage in the Nifty was 5.48 percent (which crossed 6 percent currently) as per January data available on the National Stock Exchange, while HDFC Bank has the highest weightage in the index at 8.22 percent followed by ITC (6.94 percent), HDFC (6.87 percent), Infosys (5.89 percent) and ICICI Bank (4.97 percent).

Investors cheered new Jio tariff plans announced by Reliance Industries' Chairman and Managing Director, Mukesh Ambani on Tuesday during market hours.

Ambani announced a slew of offers for its existing Jio customers. At a one-time fee of Rs 99, existing Jio customers could get Jio’s services for one year at a price of Rs 303 per month from April 1, 2017.

Expressing gratitude to Jio's first 100 million users, Mukesh Ambani said that for customers coming onboard before April 1 will be eligible to avail a 'Jio Prime' membership, enrolment for which will start from March 1 onwards and will be opened till March 31, 2017.

From soap and shampoo to cement and automobiles, businesses have seen the demonetisation move punching red marks on their balance sheets, even as they continue to put on a brave face on hopes for ""long-term gains from this short-term pain"".

An analysis of the latest-quarter results of listed firms shows that the government's ambitious exercise of withdrawing old Rs 500/1,000 notes led to adverse impact on businesses across the sectors, though not many have publicly criticised the move and the likes of Rajiv Bajaj are only an exception.

The companies having acknowledged the negative impact of the demonetisation move in their financial statements for the October-December quarter, although mostly by expecting it to be a positive game-changer and a 'new normal' in the very next sentence, include giants from the groups like Ambanis, Tatas, Birlas, Mahindras, ITC, Hindustan Unilever, Dabur and Bajaj.

""Pace of domestic demand growth slowed down due to demonetisation of old currency notes during the quarter.

However, demand is expected to revive as the effects of demonetisation are absorbed and the economy readjusts to the new normal,"" Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) said.

Regarding its Reliance Retail unit, RIL said the demonetisation led to cautious buying by customers for a short period, though some segments actually saw faster growth during that time - a trend largely attributed to digital payments.

At petro outlets also, there was a tepid growth in sales on a quarter-on-quarter basis, which the company said, was due to demonetisation since Reliance petro outlets were not allowed to accept demonetised currency unlike PSU outlets.

In an investor presentation, Aditya Birla Group's UltraTech described the note ban as ""short-term pain and long-term gain"" and listed a number of short-term adverse impact such as ""acute liquidity crunch"", reduction in purchase volumes as also impact on GDP and currency rates.

However, for long term, it expected a number of benefits such as fall in inflation and interest rates, increase in public spending and strengthening of organised sector.

Ultratech said the segments most impacted immediately included daily wage earners, transporters, households and retail sales, while for cement sector in particular it expected demand to be impacted due to cash squeeze in system.

Tata Group firm Titan Company, in a quarterly update for third fiscal quarter, said all its consumer-facing businesses witnessed a ""drastic slowdown for a few days"".

While the sale in modern retail and dedicated retail channels recovered soon after, ""the sale in the trade channel in watches (the multi-brand outlets) has taken a hit and is yet to recover as most transactions in these outlets have been on cash basis,"" Titan said last month.

On November 8, 2016, post the demonetisation announcement by the Prime Minister, many Tanishq stores experienced a huge rush of buyers and sales were abnormally high. After that, there was a brief period of lull post which Tanishq's average daily sales were close to the average daily sales pre-demonetisation, the company added.

Mahindra and Mahindra said the auto industry was impacted due to demonetisation in the third quarter, with all segments of auto and tractor industry showing substantial drop in demand during November and December 2016, while the impact was more on rural sales than in the urban areas."

Nifty earnings growth of 6 percent turned out to be a tad weaker due to a drag from Tata Motors and Axis Bank, he adds.

He now expects FY18 Nifty earnings growth of 17 percent with small downside risk due to margin concern.

In model portfolio, he removed Tata Motors and reduced the weight for HUL, ITC and Maruti. He raised IT rating to overweight and added GSK Consumer.

Moneycontrol BureauConcerns over US government policy remains a key risk for the IT sector, but the risks are priced into valuations to a large extent, says broking firm CLSA.The broking firm has upgraded its rating on the sector to 'overweight’.“On the other hand, an improving growth outlook for the US economy, particularly the US financials and retail, is especially positive for the sector,” said CLSA in a note to clients.CLSA feels the risk-reward ratio has turned favourable as the sector as a whole has been underperforming the market over the past year.It has rated HCL Tech as its top pick in the sector and added the stock to its high conviction list, while removing ITC and Maruti from that list.In its model portfolio, CLSA has removed Tata Motors and reduced the weight for HUL, ITC and Maruti."
