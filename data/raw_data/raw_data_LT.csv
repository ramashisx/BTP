Larsen & Toubro Ltd. is weighing a merger between two of its publicly traded software firms, according to people familiar with the matter, as the Indian conglomerate seeks scale to compete with global digital giants.

The boards of Mindtree Ltd. and Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd., two software units controlled by the Mumbai-based engineering firm, could consider share swap ratios for the merger as early as next week, one of the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is not public.

Larsen acquired control of Mindtree in 2019. The conglomerate holds about a 61% stake in the company, which has a market value of $8.3 billion, and has around 74% of L&T Infotech, which has a market capitalization of $13.6 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

The two companies have minimal overlap in businesses or clients, and a tie-up would give them better pricing power and lower costs, one of the people said.

Deliberations around the merger are ongoing and the plan could be delayed or fall apart, the people said. Representatives for Larsen, Mindtree and L&T Infotech couldn’t immediately comment on queries from Bloomberg News. Mindtree and L&T Infotech are scheduled to report earnings Monday and Tuesday respectively.

The proposed merger comes as software companies are seeing surging demand from businesses embracing the digitization that accelerated during Covid-19. Large IT outsourcing firms are also expanding into areas such as cybersecurity, automation and machine-learning support, moving beyond lower-margin traditional back-room services."

The Nifty closed the week, month as well as the financial year at an all-time closing high of 9,173.75 on Friday, and it rallied further on Monday to hit a fresh record closing high of 9,237.

The dynamics of the market stand largely unchanged. The index still remains in a consolidation phase trading in a range of 8,950-9,200. The low of last 2 weeks placed at 9,020 corresponds to a double bottom (basically hourly charts).

For the coming sessions, if the index manages to hold 9,020 levels, then prices may see an extension towards 9,300-9,500 mark. On the flip side, a break below 9,020 may take the index towards 8950-8900 mark.

The level of 8,950 further gathers significance, as around those levels the market also closes the GAP that market created from close of 8,934 on March 10, 2017 to open of 9,092 on March 14, 2017.

While the Nifty may remain on a consolidation path, stock-specific movements could be the flavour of the week. Here is a list of top five stocks to track based on technical parameters.

L&T: BUY| Target Rs 1,750| Stop Loss Rs 1,491| Upside 5 percent

L&T registered series of higher top & higher bottom formations since December 2016, after a sustained correction of 6 months spanning a move from around Rs 1,615 to Rs 1,300.

The current leg sprang up in the form of a gap-up from Rs 1,491 on 10th March to Rs 1,517 on 14th March. This move has sustained very well after almost a month’s consolidation between Rs 1,446 and Rs 1,515.

The delivered volume in the stock is one marker that the scrip is changing hands onto strong hands. This would in a way open the gates to the distribution phase of 2014 around the Rs 1,750-1,800 mark.

Exide Industries: BUY| Target Rs 250| Stop Loss 195| Upside 8 percent

The stock remained in a rational uptrend all through the last one year, the prices showed an intermediate dip from Rs 200 to Rs 165 spanning the months of Nov-Dec 2016.

The period also saw the formation of a double bottom on daily charts that corresponded to testing of the 200 DMA, which was then placed at Rs 169 mark.

The latest leg has seen a consolidation breakout spanning Rs 200-220 spanning over Feb-Mar 2017. A rising average traded price (ATP) on daily charts along with the RSI shifting base to a higher trajectory, is an add-on to the bullish sentiment.

We feel dynamics are ripe for an up-move to the 250 mark, which may further get extended to the 275 mark. The stop may be placed a bit below the consolidation zone at the 195 mark.

ZEE Entertainment: BUY| Target Rs 585| Stop Loss 495| Upside 10 percent

The daily charts show a series of higher top and higher bottom formations since December 2016, after a sustained 3-month correction that spanned from Rs 585 to Rs 430 between October and December 2016.

The current leg has seen positive crossovers of long-term moving averages in March 2017, with 50-DMA going above the 100-DMA as well as the 200-DMA.

We feel this positive crossover may take prices through to at least the 52-week high placed at Rs 585. The view may get negated on a closing below the breakout level of around Rs 495.

Adani Power: BUY| Target Rs 48-60| Stop Loss Rs 33.5| Upside 20 percent

The charts are showing a high momentum move over last 4 months, which has seen prices shoot from Rs 28 mark to the current level of Rs 40 (around 50 percent). The last 3 months have seen a positive crossover of the longer term moving averages with 50-DMA above the 100-DMA, which in turn is also trading above the 200-DMA.

The long-term charts indicate a space till Rs 48, which may extend even to a level of Rs 60 over coming quarter. The up-move may get hindered if prices move down below the Rs 33.5 mark

Ajanta Pharma: SELL| Target Rs 1,525| Stop Loss Rs 1,850| Return 12 percent

In line with the overall weak trajectory in the pharma sector, the prices have remained subdued spanning in the last 3 months. The last 2 weeks have seen prices moving down to Rs 1,760 after testing the facing a stiff resistance at the moving average convergence around the Rs 1,800-1,850 mark.

The level also has multiple touch points with highs of January and March 2017. The prices are on course for a correction to the 6-month lows around the 1525 mark. The bearish view would stand negated only on a closing above the Rs 1,850 mark.

The Nifty closed at 9,108 and has largely remained sideways for the whole of the last week. This is despite the market still trading within a percent and a half from its all-time high of 9,218, created a few days back.

The market seems to be interestingly poised, even though it has remained on a lower step, within the high of 9,168 compared with 9,218 and low of 9,019 compared to 9,060 corresponding to the week passed by.

The level of 9,060 further gathers significance, as around those levels the market also enters the GAP that market created from close of 8,934 on March 10, 2017 to open of 9,092 on March 14, 2017.

While the market has remained within this ambit, there is a marked case of profit booking at higher levels, which has given rise to rotational movement within the index constituents especially the heavyweights. We maintain a cautious approach from here on as a welcome correction is not ruled out.

GEPL Capital lists out stocks to watch based on this rotational aspect of the index for medium to long term.

Tata Steel: BUY| Target Rs 575| Stop Loss 460| Return: 17 percent

The charts are showing a rational uptrend almost since a year, with intermediate bouts of profit booking. This has seen all the longer term moving averages like 50, 100 & 200-days moving averages too, remaining in a rational uptrend as well as positively aligned.

In the latest leg, the prices corrected from around Rs 500 to a level of around Rs 463, and after consolidation moved UP on pretty big delivered volume back to Rs 500.

In the process, a good amount of Put writing was seen at lower levels around the Rs 480-490 mark creating a good setup for an up move. On the flip side, expiry pressures may hold up the stock within the ambit of Rs 520 on the higher side, though a good move is expected past the expiry.

We feel prices would create space till around Rs 530 followed by a take at the 2-year high around the Rs 575 mark. On the lower side, the recent swing low of around Rs 460-465 will prove to be a good demand zone. One may place stops a bit below these levels on a closing basis.

Hindalco: BUY| Target Rs 225| Stop Loss Rs 175| Return: 13 percent

Hindalco has maintained in a rational uptrend that has seen the formation of higher top and higher bottoms right since February 2016.

In fact, the latest leg has seen Hindalco create fresh 52-week highs at Rs 202 just last to last week; which is also higher than the high of last 3-years placed around the Rs 198 mark.

Once again, the consolidation seems to be pretty strong with exponential delivered volumes being around twice the averages. We feel there could be a case of a sustained uptrend that could test the levels of around Rs 225 with an extension to all-time highs of Rs 248-250 created in 2011.

The stops may be placed around 175 on a closing basis, a bit below the intermediate bottom of 178 created in February 2017.

L&T: BUY| Target Rs 1,615-1,750| Return: 12 percent

The charts are showing a series of higher top and higher bottom formations since December 2016, after a sustained correction of 6 months spanning a move from around Rs 1,615 to Rs 1,300.

The current leg sprang up in the form of a gap-up from Rs 1,491 on March 10 to Rs 1,517 on March 14. This move has sustained very well after almost a month’s consolidation between Rs 1,446 and Rs 1,515.

This would in a way open the gates to the 52-week high at 1,615 followed by the distribution phase of 2014 around the Rs 1,750-1,800 mark.

RBL Bank: BUY| Target Rs 525-530| Stop Loss 475-485: Return 7 percent

The stock has remained a favorite for the neo-banks group, as after listing around the Rs 300 mark around 6 months back, the prices have risen in a classical higher top and higher bottom trajectory.

This has been prefixed by a good consolidation of 3 weeks till Rs 420 levels. A high volume up-move was further seen where prices went higher onto Rs 500 levels. We feel this has created space till Rs 525-530 levels on the higher side with little barriers in between, while the base remains etched around the Rs 475-485 mark.

Axis Bank: SELL| Target Rs 442-476| Stop Loss Rs 515| Return: 2-9 percent

Although the news doing the rounds of a possible merger with Kotak Bank seems to have supported the prices for around 2 months, the undertone seems to have remained pre- dominantly bearish.

It happens to be one of the very few stocks to be still trading below the long-term 200-DMA (Daily Moving Average). In fact, the recent move was cut short just near this resistance level of around the Rs 525 mark.

We feel the prices are back to their weak self and any rise from here on should be an opportunity to add to shorts or exit existing holdings.

The downsides till recent swing low at Rs 476 followed by the previous swing low placed at Rs 442 would open up. A stop may be placed a bit above the current 200-DMA placed at Rs 515 on a weekly closing basis.

Indian firms have spurned some USD 15 billion worth of government tenders to make a range of weapons since 2013, Defence Ministry officials say, in a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his drive to wean the country off imported arms.

Executives cited unrealistic quality demands from a military short of planes, tanks and guns as a key reason for their reluctance to bid for projects. Complicating things further, the military doesn't want weapons from Indian firms with no track record in defence manufacturing, experts said.

Irked by India's status as the world's biggest arms importer, Modi wants to build an advanced defence industry but almost a year into his ""Make in India"" campaign, which aims to turn the country into a manufacturing powerhouse, not one large domestic weapons project has been awarded.

Tenders for anything from air defence guns to surface-to-air missiles to transport planes have lapsed, Defence Ministry officials told Reuters. The tenders total around USD 15 billion according to a Reuters compilation of offers since early 2013.

""'Make in India' is a laudable aim, but it's moving rather slowly. It's not a switch you can press and everything will fall into place,"" said Vivek Rae, head of procurement at the Defence Ministry from 2010-2012.

Anil Ambani, the billionaire chairman of the Reliance Group, recounted at a recent conference how Modi asked him if he knew India didn't make tear gas shells. ""Even the tears we shed are foreign,"" Ambani quoted Modi.

Modi wants to build a strong military after years of neglect that military planners say has left India vulnerable should rivals China and Pakistan ever launch a combined attack, although experts say this is highly unlikely. India is being challenged, however, in its Indian Ocean backyard, where China's more modernised navy is starting to assert itself.

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has said new defence production policies will be unveiled in April to address the concerns of private firms: opaque procedures, unrealistic quality requirements and slow decision-making.

""We're trying to simplify procedures, create a level-playing field but still there are many cases of zero participation in tenders,"" said G. Mohan Kumar, the defence production secretary leading the localisation drive.

The military declined to comment, referring queries to the Defence Ministry, which controls procurement.

RINGFENCING PROJECTS

India gets 70 per cent of its arms from abroad. For decades, it has bought off-the-shelf equipment mainly from Russia, which offered to assemble some weaponry locally but little in the way of technology transfers.

Modi has vowed to change that by ringfencing USD 100 billion worth of defence deals for domestic companies over the next decade under which they can build on their own or with foreign partners.

Last year the government asked several Indian companies to show interest in an estimated USD 1.7 billion deal to replace 1960s-era Swedish air defence guns, but only one said it could meet the requirements, said one of the Defence Ministry officials. He declined to identify the company.

The head of one firm which told the government it was not interested in the project said the military laid down ""impossible"" requirements by insisting on technology that only foreign manufacturers had. He declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of defence issues.

In November, the government put an estimated USD 2 billion proposal to replace its ageing fleet of Avro cargo planes on ice after the tender attracted only one bidder, a partnership between Europe's Airbus Group and India's Tata Sons TATAS.UL.

""Even if there is an alternative better solution, as per current practice the requirements cannot be changed, or if they are changed it is questioned,"" said MV Kotwal, head of defence business at infrastructure group Larsen and Toubro. ""The flexibility is not there.""

Over the past 18 months, 41 requests for expressions of interest for naval projects alone fell through because of problems relating to manufacturing requirements, the Defence Ministry official added.

JUMPSTART

Trying to move projects along, Modi's government in February approved an USD 8 billion proposal to build warships in India that had been awaiting cabinet signoff since 2012.

It has also ordered an accelerated local programme to build six diesel-electric submarines, in addition to six similar vessels that French firm DCNS is assembling in Mumbai port to replace India's ageing underwater fleet.

A Defence Ministry committee submitted a report last month identifying five private and state-run shipyards where the submarines could be built with a foreign partner. It will now invite expressions of interest for the USD 8.5 billion project.

Experts said one problem is that some military officers eye technology only available in the west, without understanding what Indian firms can produce.

""The armed forces are reluctant to accept hardware that doesn't have a record in operational conditions. Indian companies have no track record,"" said Bharat Karnad at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi.

Retired vice admiral Premvir Das added that to expect Indian companies to manufacture major defence platforms in the forseeable future is to ""live in a dreamland""."

Bharat Iyer of JP Morgan: The dependence on global liquidity and quantitative easing tapering linked volatility will likely continue over Q1CY14. The result of the national election in May would play an important role in H2CY (January-June 2014) growth revival, particularly for the investment cycle and also for the performance of Indian equities. Our top picks have a cyclical bias. ICICI Bank and DLF are domestic cyclical expected to benefit from a revival in growth and modest valuations. We also expect global growth to accelerate into the year ahead which should benefit companies like Tata Motors, Tata Steel and HCL Technologies. Cyclical recovery makes us more cautious on expensive defensives, HUL and Colgate.

Neelkanth Mishra of Credit Suisse: We expect the divergence between the investment cycle and middle-income consumption on one hand and low-end consumption on the other to continue. Growth in the informal economy though should continue to drive wage growth for the poor. Indices have already started to reflect this divergence. Our model portfolio stays defensive with Reliance Industries, Godrej Consumer, HCL Technologies and ITC as top longs and Larsen and Toubro, Tata Steel and SBI as top shorts."

Engineering giant Larsen and Toubro has said it is developing its facilities in Oman as a regional manufacturing hub to cater to the growing needs of the countries in the Gulf and beyond.

L&T's facilities at Sohar in Oman are already the company's largest manufacturing footprint outside India - far larger than its plants in China, South East Asia and Europe - and are actively contributing to the economic growth of countries in the region, the company said in a statement.

The USD 14 billion technology, engineering, construction and manufacturing major's twin facilities in Sohar consist of a large modular fabrication yard - the only such large facility in Oman and among few facilities in the region capable of loading out large structures weighing as much as 20,000 tonnes.

Adjoining the yard is a Heavy Engineering manufacturing facility that makes complex process plant equipment for the refining, petrochemical, fertilizer and power sectors, the Times of Oman reported.

Commencing production in 2007, the facilities already have a record of impressive technological accomplishments - a large of number of well-head platforms, offshore jack-up rigs, and multiple reactors with complex metallurgy. But perhaps of even greater significance are the positive social changes and economic impact that the L&T Sohar Complex has brought about, the report said.

The Sohar complex has proved to be a valuable engine of economic growth and exports. As the only facility of its kind in Oman, and among the largest in the region, the yard is in a particularly advantageous position to meet the needs of the oil and gas industry of the region and beyond, it said.

Most of its products are exported to other countries in the Gulf, India, South East Asia, Europe and the Americas, thus, earning foreign exchange for the country. This trend is likely to grow in the future as the region prepares to accelerate growth through oil diversification policies and an extra focus on manufacturing."

Three months since journeying more than 700 miles (1,130 kms)from his village in Chhattisgarh to take a job in this bustling city near the capital, New Delhi, Charan is already looking forward to a 10 percent pay rise. He isn't an engineer or programmer. He hauls bricks and sand at a local construction site for less than USD100 a month.

India's biggest cities face a worsening shortage of migrant manual labourers like 26-year-old Charan, who goes by only one name. While India has long suffered from a dearth of workers with vocational skills like plumbers and electricians, efforts to alleviate poverty in poor, rural areas have helped stifle what was once a flood of cheap, unskilled labour from India's poorest states.

Also read: Inflation remained a big challenge for govt, RBI in 2013

Struggling to cope with soaring food prices, this dwindling supply of migrant workers are demanding - and increasingly getting - rapid increases in pay and benefits.

""After paying for food we are left with almost nothing. We need a wage hike,"" said Charan, who sends a part of whatever he and his wife, who works at the same site, manage to save to their parents back home in Chhattisgarh.

If their employer refuses to give them an adequate raise, they are confident they'll find better-paying jobs at one of the hundreds of other sites dotted around Gurgaon.

Such gains by migrants and the rural poor don't come without a cost to the rest of the country.

More than pressuring corporate profits, these rapid blue-collar wage increases threaten efforts to quell inflation by new Reserve Bank of India (RBI) chief, Raghuram Rajan, the former International Monetary Fund economist who took over as governor at the RBI in September. Rajan has made price stability a policy priority, calling it a prerequisite for reviving economic growth that has slipped to 5 percent a year, the lowest in a decade.

Despite little evidence that interest rates can control food prices, Rajan has raised rates twice since taking over to prevent food-price inflation from spilling over into the wider economy. He has warned of another hike next month if prices don't cool significantly.

""India has become a high-cost economy,"" said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings & Research. ""Persistently high inflation is a recipe for disaster.""

Take onions, which figure in almost every Indian meal. Prices for onions shot up 190 percent to USD 1.60 a kilogram in the past year, making them more expensive in India than in the United States, where incomes are roughly 35 times higher. That helped push vegetable prices up 95 percent in the past year and pushed India's headline inflation rate in November to 7.5 percent, a 14-month high.

And while vegetable prices are expected to start easing next month following a bumper harvest, subsidised government purchases of grains and rising farming costs mean overall food inflation is not likely to slow down much.

RURAL PROGRAMMES

Farming costs are also being driven higher by a government-run, rural employment guarantee programme that uses public works projects to provide at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment each financial year to each rural household with adult members willing to work on irrigation, reforestation, soil conservation and road construction.

Since its rollout in 2006, the programme has helped boost livelihoods on poor Indian farms. In the largely rural Andhra Pradesh, according to one study, the programme has enabled households to boost spending by a tenth, and raise spending on items other than food by almost a quarter.

Rural wage increases have jumped, from 2.7 percent a year before the programme to 9.7 percent after its passage. Since 2009, nominal agricultural wages have climbed by more than a fifth a year, with non-farm rural wages up almost 17 percent.

Adding to wage inflation is a pickup in economic activity and job creation in laggard states of central and eastern India, which in the past used to be the main source of migrant labour.

Improved law and order and greater focus on development have helped boost growth in poorer states such as northeastern Bihar, whose economy has been growing by roughly 11 percent a year since 2006.

While that's not enough to reverse India's broader economic slowdown, migration of workers has dramatically slowed down.

With jobs and wages rising so fast at home, big cities offer less of a lure to rural workers. Bihar estimates that immigration of unskilled workers last year dropped by two-fifths. That's shutting down an important source of workers for industries that have come to rely on them, particularly the construction sector that accounts for 8 percent of India's GDP.

""Wages in states like Bihar are more or less comparable to those in Delhi,"" said Ram Kumar, a contractor who supplies workers to different construction projects around Gurgaon. ""But the cost of living is much cheaper than Delhi. So there's not much to gain from coming to big cities.""

_PAGEBREAK_

ADD-ON BENEFITS

Wages for blue-collar workers, skilled and unskilled, are growing by an estimated 15 percent a year, according to government data, faster than the 6 percent average inflation rate, but barely above the 13 percent average annual increase in food prices. Construction workers have managed to do better, with wages rising at an average of 18 percent annually since 2009, according to data from India's Construction Industry Development Council, a joint government-private sector body.

""Inflation is leading to the need to increase wages,"" said Kumar Gera, Chairman at Gera Developments, a real estate developer in western India. ""When workers come and tell you they can't afford essential food items with what they are earning, you have to raise wages.""

To retain workers, some companies provide canteens with free food, clinics and even day-care and schools, in addition to on-site housing.

At the residential site where Charan works, for example, Emaar MGF Land Ltd - a joint venture between Dubai's Emaar Properties PJSC and MGF Development Ltd - IL&FS Engineering and Construction Co Ltd and Larsen and Toubro Ltd have all built military-style barracks for workers next to the construction sites.

Weak demand has so far not allowed developers to pass rising labour costs on to buyers, but that appears certain to change.

Rajan Kale, a tendering manager at port and road builder Man Infraconstruction Ltd. , said rising wages trimmed the company's net profit by about 2 percent last year, contributing to an overall 34 percent drop in profit. His company plans to start including annual wage increases of up to 15 percent into its project budgets, he said.

That may not be enough for workers coping with India's rising grocery bills. Last week, Kumar, the labour contractor, pulled his 15 workers from one construction project after its developer refused their demand for a 10-15 percent pay increase.

""Workers are ready to switch employers for a hike of as little as 10 rupees,"" Kumar said.

Now his team is working for a different company at a different site - earning 20 percent more."

Angel Broking's report on Larsen and Toubro (L&T)

""We believe L&T will continue to occupy a unique position in the Indian E&C space as a diversified and large engineering play, with exposure to areas ranging from power, defense, nuclear and equipment, in spite of short-term concerns. Given its robust order backlog, healthy order inflows during the past few quarter, and strong execution capability, the company is well placed to achieve its guidance on both- order inflow and revenue front. It is also best placed to benefit from a gradual recovery in the capex cycle given its diverse exposure to sectors and a strong balance sheet. Going forward, on the back of healthy order book mix, we expect the company to report a revenue and PAT CAGR of 10.8 percent and 6.1 percent over FY2013-15 respectively.""

""At the current market price of Rs 1,062, the stock is trading at 16.1x FY2015E earnings and 2.8x FY2015E P/BV on a standalone basis. We have used the sum of-the-parts (SOTP) methodology to value the company to capture all its business initiatives and investments/stakes in subsidiaries and other businesses. Ascribing separate values to its parent business on a P/E basis and investments in subsidiaries on P/E, P/BV and mcap basis, our target price works out to Rs 1,237. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock,"" says Angel Broking research report.
